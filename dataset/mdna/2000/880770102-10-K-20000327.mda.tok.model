sales of backplane connection systems to unaffiliated customers grew as a result of continued growth in demand from networking  data storage  and other high technology customers 
other test systems sales were down from with decreases in telecommunications test systems of and circuit board test systems of 
these decreases were a result of telecommunication customers reducing investment in traditional voice testing technology and circuit board test systems customers seeking lower cost solutions and or new solutions to test increasing complex circuit boards 
other test systems sales decreases were offset slightly by an increase of in sales of software test systems to customers within the telecommunication and web based application development markets 
net income grew million to million in from million in income before income taxes increased million from million in to million in semiconductor test systems and backplane connection systems income before income taxes increased million and million  respectively in due to increased sales 
other test systems income before income taxes decreased million in resulting in a loss before income taxes of million in this decrease in income before income taxes was due to decreased sales coupled with the company maintaining its engineering and development of new products 
incoming orders increased from  million in to a record  million in orders increased in nearly all operating segments and were led by a increase in semiconductor test systems orders 
backplane connection systems and software test systems orders both increased and circuit board test systems orders increased by a modest 
orders for telecommunications test systems decreased in as a result of record bookings  the company s backlog increased to a record million 
costs of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from of sales in to of sales in included in cost of sales in was a million charge for excess inventory 
the charge resulted from the drop in demand for semiconductor test systems products 
excluding this charge cost of sales decreased from to 
the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the increased utilization of the company s manufacturing overhead as sales volume increased while certain components of cost of sales remained fixed 
engineering and development expenses were of sales in both and representing a year over year increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to new product development expenses in semiconductor test systems although there were increased expenses related to product development in each of the company s operating segments 
selling and administrative expenses were of sales in both and representing a year over year increase of million 
the increase was due to higher compensation related expenses and spending in support of increased semiconductor test systems and software test systems sales 
interest income increased million to million in compared to due to an increase in the company s average invested balances 
the company s effective tax rate was in and the company utilized export sales corporation benefits and certain research and development tax credits to operate below the us statutory rate of 
compared to sales increased in to  million from  million in due to a strong backlog at the beginning of  semiconductor test systems shipments increased by  despite a decline in sales by the semiconductor test equipment market as a whole 
sales of backplane connection systems to unaffiliated customers grew as a result of growth in demand from networking  data storage  and other high technology customers 
other test systems sales were up from with increases in circuit board test systems of  telecommunications test systems of  and software test systems of 
net income fell from million in to million in excluding the effect of pre tax special charges of million for excess raw material inventory and million for acquired in process technology in and  respectively  income before income taxes decreased million from million in to million in incoming orders decreased from  million in to  million in a drop in semiconductor test system orders drove the decline 
offsetting that decline  backplane connection systems orders grew and software test systems orders increased by 
orders for circuit board test systems and telecommunications test systems decreased and  respectively 
the company s backlog fell to million as a result of the decrease in orders 
costs of sales as a percentage of sales  excluding a charge of million for excess inventory  increased from of sales in to of sales in the charge for excess inventory resulted from the drop in demand for semiconductor test systems products 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher costs related to the increased shipment of new semiconductor test systems products and the relationship of fixed manufacturing costs to the lower semiconductor test systems shipment volume in the second half of in addition  backplane connection systems cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased over as a result of capacity expansion at its printed circuit board facility and the costs to support production activity of connector design wins at several new customers 
engineering and development expenses were of sales in both and representing a year over year increase of million 
the increases were primarily in semiconductor test systems although there were increased expenses related to product development in each of the operating segments 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million in over  representing a decrease from of sales in to of sales in the dollar increase was primarily related to the introduction and marketing of new semiconductor and software test system products 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the tax rate declined due to increases in certain research and development tax credits and increases in export sales corporation benefits

requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction 
management is currently evaluating the effects of this change on its recording of derivatives and hedging activities 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the application of the guidance in sab will be required in the company s fiscal year the effects of applying this guidance will be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment resulting from a change in accounting principle 
the company has not completed its evaluation of sab and is therefore unable to determine its impact 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s exchange rate risk management the company regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position and firm commitments 
the company s firm commitments consist of certain orders received in currencies other than us dollars 
forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce the company s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
the company does not engage in currency speculation 
at december  the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy us dollars for non us currencies was million 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since these contracts hedge non us currency transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at december  and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk management due to its short term duration the fair value of the company s cash and investment portfolio at december  approximated carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for issues contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k and the company s annual report to shareholders may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in item business relating to the company s delivery time of unfilled orders  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and planned capital expenditures  may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that any future increase in semiconductor test systems bookings for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  and trade secrets 
while the company believes that its patents  copyrights  and trade secrets have value  in general no single one is in itself essential 
the company believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its research and development personnel 
from time to time the company is notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others 
an assertion of patent infringement against the company  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products  and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to the company s success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
the company faces substantial competition  throughout the world  in each operating segment 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
the company also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers 
certain of the company s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those currently offered by the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the united states 
international sales are subject to significant risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and policy changes affecting the company s markets  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company s semiconductor test systems operating segment generates a significant portion of its revenue from customers operating in south asian countries and taiwan 
although the economies of south asian countries and taiwan have stabilized to some degree since mid fiscal  if these economies deteriorate the negative economic developments would increase the likelihood of either a direct or indirect adverse impact on the company s future operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  fulfilling backlog on a timely basis  reliance on sole source suppliers  potential retrofit costs  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and the timing of investments in engineering and development 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
year as of the company s fiscal month ended february  the company has not experienced any material negative impact related to the year problem in any of its business critical functions 
based upon our ability to deliver our products and services without interruption and information received from vendors and service providers  the company has no reason to believe that there will be any material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations relating to any year problem 
however  if the information received from vendors and service providers is not accurate or happens to change  then there could be an unforeseen material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company will continue to monitor its systems and operations until it is reasonably assured that no significant business interruptions will occur as a result of the year problem 
the aggregate costs incurred by the company in addressing its year problem were within the million estimate previously reported by the company
