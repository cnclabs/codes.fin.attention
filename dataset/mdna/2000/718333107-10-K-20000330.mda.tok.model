funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash requirements  including its ability to make cash distributions

the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  and will continue to monitor its systems and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
inflation substantially all of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increase in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
