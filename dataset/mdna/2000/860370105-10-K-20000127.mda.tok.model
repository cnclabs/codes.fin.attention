item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction death care businesses in the united states traditionally have been relatively small  family owned enterprises that have been passed down through successive generations within a family 
during the last decade  however  the industry in the united states  and in certain foreign countries  has undergone a transition in which family owned firms were consolidating with larger organizations  such as the company 
this trend began to change in fiscal year for further discussion of this trend  see business the death care industry 
as a result  although the company s historical growth has been primarily from acquisitions  the company is currently focusing on growth through internal strategies 
two other trends affecting the death care industry are the expected increase in the number of deaths and the average age of the population 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the number of deaths in the united states is expected to increase by approximately percent per year from million in to million in in addition  industry studies indicate that while the death rate is declining slightly  the average age of the population in the united states is increasing 
the aging of the population  particularly the baby boomers who have recently begun to turn  represents a significant opportunity for firms such as the company to expand their customer base and secure a portion of their future market share by actively marketing prearranged property  merchandise and services 
according to the bureau of the census  the united states population over years of age will increase from million in to million in the company s principal target market for sales of prearranged cemetery property  merchandise and services is customers who are age and above

see cautionary statements 
the discussion herein should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
change in accounting principle effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for earnings realized by irrevocable prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts 
the company now defers all of the earnings realized by irrevocable prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying funeral service is delivered 
previously  the company recognized a portion of these earnings and deferred the remainder to offset the estimated future effects of inflation 
the accounting change was made principally to match revenue recognition more closely with cash receipts and also to improve the comparability of its earnings with those of its principal competitors 
the new method will allow the company to take a longer term view and increase its flexibility in managing the funeral trust funds 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item this change generally will result in reduced near term funeral revenue and gross profit  due to the deferral of all of the earnings from funeral trust funds and escrow accounts until the funeral is performed 
trust and escrow investments the company s funeral and cemetery business includes prearranged sales funded through trust and escrow arrangements  as well as maintenance of cemetery grounds funded through perpetual care funds 
the company s investment strategy for these funds is  among other criteria  partially dependent on the ability to withdraw net realized capital gains from these funds 
however  withdrawal of capital gains is not permitted for perpetual care funds in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  funds for which net capital gains are permitted to be withdrawn typically are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting principally of us government securities  other interest bearing securities and preferred stocks rated a or better  blue chip publicly traded common stocks  money market funds and other short term investments 
income from funds  especially those invested partially in common stock  can be materially affected by prevailing interest rates and the performance of the stock market 
in managing its north american funds including those in puerto rico and excluding those in mexico  which include investments in common stock  the company seeks an overall annual yield of approximately percent to percent 
in the past three years  such funds have generated overall annual yields in that range 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving any particular yield 
results of operations for purposes of the following discussion  funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared are referred to as existing operations 
correspondingly  funeral homes and cemeteries acquired or opened during either period being compared are referred to as acquired operations 
comparisons between fiscal years and reflect the pro forma effects of applying the new accounting principle as if the change had occurred on november   whereas  comparisons between fiscal years and are presented as originally reported 
the following table presents the results as reported for the fiscal year ended october  and the pro forma results for the year ended october  year ended october  as reported pro forma in millions revenues funeral cemetery costs and expenses funeral cemetery gross profit corporate general and administrative expenses operating earnings before performance based stock options performance based stock options operating earnings interest expense  net other income earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income taxes earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle includes a nonrecurring  noncash charge of million million  after tax recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year in connection with the vesting of performance based stock options

partially offsetting this increase was a percent  events decrease in the number of domestic funeral services performed by existing operations percent  events decrease worldwide 
funeral profit margin from existing operations increased from percent in to percent in this improvement resulted primarily from the increase in funeral revenue from existing operations discussed above  coupled with increased cost control measures  including contract negotiations with certain vendors and the company s centralization and standardization of certain financial and administrative functions through its shared services center 
the increase in revenue and costs from acquired operations resulted primarily from the company s acquisition of funeral homes during fiscal year which is not reflected in the period presented above 
the company believes that at need funeral revenues in some key markets were negatively affected in fiscal year by intense and growing price competition from low cost funeral providers and casket stores in some markets  the continuing and accelerating trend toward cremation  and a shift by customers to lower priced services and merchandise 
the company plans to respond to these trends by reducing prices where appropriate in order to gain market share  reducing costs by moving to smaller funeral buildings and consolidating funeral facilities where appropriate  and transitioning some of its funeral businesses to emphasize alternative services 
the company is testing new marketing and merchandising programs to enhance revenues without raising prices 
in addition to focusing on increasing margins at existing businesses  the company is also focusing on increasing revenues and profits from internal growth strategies such as increasing operating partnerships with third parties  increasing alternative service firms  and building new funeral homes on the company s cemetery properties 
see business growth strategies 
historically  one of the company s goals has been to achieve a percent to percent increase annually in the average revenue per funeral service performed by existing operations through a combination of price increases and improvements in merchandising 
for the year ended october   the average revenue per funeral service performed by existing funeral homes increased percent domestically and percent worldwide  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  which were below this objective 
because of intense and growing competition from low cost funeral service and merchandise providers in certain key markets  the company has revised its goals for increases in the average revenue per funeral service performed worldwide to to percent annually

the company experienced an increase in its effective tax rate from percent in fiscal year to percent in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate was due to an increase in income from jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities of the company were million as of october   an increase of million from october  this increase was the result of the reclassification of certain voluntary escrow funds from long term investments to marketable securities 
the reclassification was made as these funds are all expected to be converted to cash by october   providing the company with additional cash for general operating purposes 
the company provided cash of million from its operations for the year ended october   compared to providing cash of million for fiscal year  due principally to an increase in other receivables and merchandise trust  less estimated cost to deliver merchandise and other working capital changes

fiscal year reflects the change in accounting principle  fiscal years and reflect the change in accounting principles  fiscal years and reflect the company s previous accounting methods that were in effect at that time 
during fiscal year  the company completed the acquisition of funeral homes and cemeteries for purchase prices aggregating approximately million  which includes the issuance of approximately  shares of class a common stock and million of seller financed acquisition indebtedness 
the cash portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions was funded primarily with advances under the company s revolving credit facilities 
subsequent to october   and through january   the company acquired or had outstanding letters of intent or definitive agreements to acquire eight businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the company plans to finance the purchase price of pending acquisitions primarily through seller financing or cash generated from the company s operations 
historically  the company has required significant capital resources to finance its acquisition program 
in response to changes in the acquisition market described under the heading business the death care industry above  the company expects to suspend its acquisition strategy in fiscal  although the company may consider acquiring firms that present an unusually attractive investment opportunity 
in addition  the company plans to implement the other cash flow initiatives described above under the heading business cash flow initiatives 
although the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures other than approximately million in commitments related to construction of the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes  the company contemplates capital expenditures of approximately million for the fiscal year ending october   which includes approximately million in internal growth initiatives including the construction of the los angeles funeral homes and approximately million for maintenance capital expenditures 
management expects that future capital requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated cash and amounts available under its revolving credit facilities 
in addition  the company monitors its mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and may from time to time decide to alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under its floating rate revolving credit facility with public or private fixed rate debt  or by entering into interest rate swaps or similar interest rate hedging transactions 
on december   moody s investors service moody s announced that it had lowered the company s credit rating from baa to ba  and on december   standard poor s s p announced that it had placed the company on credit watch with negative implications 
interest paid by the company on its revolving line of credit is based in part on its credit ratings from moody s and s p 
while the outcome of the s p review cannot be predicted at this time  neither it nor the moody s downgrade is expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s united states operations over the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company changed its method of reporting foreign currency translation adjustments for its mexican operations to the method prescribed for highly inflationary economies 
under that method  foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations  instead of in shareholders equity 
as of january   the mexican economy was no longer considered highly inflationary by the sec staff 
accordingly  subsequent to january   gains and losses resulting from translation of the financial statements of the company s mexican operations are reflected in shareholders equity  and the functional currency used by the company s mexican operations is the mexican peso 
these changes did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for fiscal year or however  no assurance can be given that a material change will not occur in the future due to events within mexico beyond the company s control 
other year issues during  all phases of the company s compliance plan were completed for all critical and non critical systems 
thorough testing was done on all critical systems  globally  after the rollover to the year  and all results were favorable 
as anticipated  the company did not experience any problems resulting from the century change in any of its domestic or international operations 
overview 
year issues result from the past practice in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year 
this practice can create breakdowns or erroneous results when computers perform operations involving years later than the company s state of readiness 
the company devised and completed an extensive compliance plan with the objective of bringing all of the company s information technology it systems and non it systems into year compliance 
the company divided its systems into i critical systems  consisting of it systems  and ii non critical systems  consisting of a mixture of it and non it systems 
each system was evaluated and brought into compliance in five phases phase i awareness prepare and present comprehensive report to management phase ii assessment identify and evaluate all systems for year compliance phase iii compliance complete necessary year modifications phase iv testing test all modified systems for year compliance phase v implementation return year compliant systems to daily operation the costs involved 
due to the fact that many of the company s computer systems have been replaced in recent years as part of the company s on going goal to maintain state of the art technology  the company s year compliance costs have been relatively low 
to date  the company has incurred expenses of approximately  for external consultants and software and hardware applications in implementing its compliance plan 
the company did not separately track the internal costs incurred for the year project 
such costs are principally payroll related costs for the company s information technology group 
risks 
if the company has not been successful in its efforts to bring its systems into year compliance the company s ability to procure merchandise in a timely and cost effective manner may be impaired  daily business procedures may be delayed due to the use of manual procedures  and some business procedures may be interrupted if no alternative methodology is available 
each of these items could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
however  to date  no problems have been identified 
the company has no guarantee that the systems of third parties were brought into compliance on a timely basis 
the non compliance of a third party s system could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company s contingency plan 
although the company believes that its year plan was adequate to achieve full system compliance on a timely basis  the company did develop contingency plans to address the possibility of the company s and third parties non compliance 
the company  to date  has not had the need to implement these or any other contingency plans

forward looking statements certain statements made herein or elsewhere by or on behalf of the company that are not historical facts are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of as previously announced  the company recently revised its short and medium term outlook and goals 
the company currently anticipates that fiscal year will be a year of transition  from a period of rapid growth  fueled primarily by acquisitions  to a period of moderate growth  driven primarily by internal growth strategies and a more intense focus on improving the operations of businesses acquired 
in this regard  management s current goal is to grow revenue in fiscal year at about percent from amounts with relatively flat  to slightly down  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda from amounts 
management s current earnings per share goal for fiscal year is in the 

range 
fiscal year goals also include spending million on internal growth initiatives 
the current tax rate anticipated for fiscal year is percent  and the company s weighted average cost of debt as of october   was percent 
the company s current goal for annual earnings per share growth after fiscal year is percent 
the company s goal is to attain that growth primarily by achieving percent to percent growth in revenues  keeping cost increases in the percent to percent range and improving cash flow to reduce debt 
the company s cash flow from operations is expected to improve  as its fiscal year estimates include only million in internal growth initiatives  and cemetery revenue  which is the principal driver for increases in installment receivables  is anticipated to be relatively flat 
the company anticipates implementing cash flow initiatives for which include analysis and possible re deployment of excess cemetery property  under performing assets and real estate that would be more valuable if converted to another use 
in response to changes in the acquisition market discussed above under the heading business the death care industry  the company has not included acquisitions in its growth expectations for fiscal year and beyond 
forward looking statements are based on assumptions about future events and are therefore inherently uncertain  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
see cautionary statements below 
cautionary statements the company cautions readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual consolidated results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company s ability to achieve its revenue goals and the corresponding cash flows from operations are affected by the volume  mix and prices of the properties  products and services sold 
the annual sales targets set by the company are aggressive  and the inability of the company to achieve planned levels in volume  mix or prices could cause the company not to meet anticipated revenue goals 
the ability of the company to achieve planned volume  mix or price levels at any location depends on numerous factors  including the local economy  the local death rate  competition and consumer preferences 
furthermore  the company is adapting to pricing pressures from low cost funeral services and merchandise providers  which may result in reducing funeral service and merchandise prices in order to recapture market share where appropriate 
preneed cemetery sales are a significant component of the company s cemetery revenue 
the company sets very aggressive preneed sales targets 
the inability of the company to achieve the planned level of sales could cause a shortfall in anticipated levels of revenue 
morale is a key ingredient in any sales organization  and morale can be adversely affected by aggressive sales targets that make it difficult for the company s over  commission sales counselors to achieve their goals 
when acquiring a business  the company sets pro forma levels at which it expects those businesses to perform based on the mix of traditional services and cremation services the business has historically delivered and how the company expects that business to perform over the next months 
as the company typically charges a higher price for a traditional service than a cremation service  material changes in the types of service delivered from those assumed in the pro forma could affect the level of anticipated revenue generated by those businesses 
additionally  although a cremation service can yield a higher margin than a traditional service  it generally produces lower revenue and a lower total gross profit 
the ability of the company to increase or sustain current price levels and retain market share is affected by local competition in the company s markets  including competition from low cost funeral providers and casket stores  as well as consumer preferences 
another important component of revenue is earnings from the company s cemetery trust funds and escrow accounts  which are determined by the size of  and returns which include dividends  interest and realized capital gains on  the funds 
the returns on the company s prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts affect the company s future revenue 
the performance of the funds depends primarily on market conditions that are not within the company s control 
additionally  the performance of the funds is affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities 
the size of the funds depends on the level of sales  funds added through acquisitions  if any  and the amount of returns that are reinvested 
future revenue is also affected by the level of prearranged sales in prior periods 
the level of prearranged sales may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including deterioration in the economy  which causes individuals to have less discretionary income 
the deathcare business is a highly fixed cost business 
positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on net earnings 
the company s planned cash flow initiatives for include analysis and possible re deployment of excess cemetery property  under performing assets and real estate that would be more valuable if converted to another use 
no assurance can be given  however  that any significant portion of the company s assets can be sold  re deployed or converted on a profitable basis or that doing so will not result  at least initially  in charges to earnings 
revenue growth goals for fiscal year and beyond do not include acquisition activity 
the actual level of acquisition activity  if any  will depend not only on the number of properties acquired  but also on the size of the acquisitions  for example  one large acquisition could increase substantially the level of acquisition activity and  consequently  revenues 
several important factors  among others  affect the company s ability to consummate acquisitions a the company may be unable to find a sufficient number of businesses for sale at prices the company is willing to pay  particularly in view of the company s recently adjusted pricing parameters and cash flow criteria 
b in most of its existing markets and in many new markets  including foreign markets  that the company may seek to enter  the company will compete for acquisitions with the other publicly traded death care firms and regional consolidators 
these competitors  and others  may be willing to pay higher prices for businesses than the company is willing to pay or may cause the company to pay more to acquire a business than the company would have to pay in the absence of such competition or may cause potential sellers to reject the company s lower prices 
thus  the aggressiveness of the company s competitors in pricing acquisitions  may affect the company s ability to complete acquisitions at prices it finds attractive 
c acquisition activity  if any  will also depend on the company s ability to enter new markets  including foreign markets 
due in part to the company s lack of experience operating in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than the company  such entry may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated by the company 
the company first entered foreign markets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be successful in expanding in foreign markets  or that any expansion in foreign markets will yield results comparable to those realized through the company s expansion in the united states 
historically  in order to support its rapid growth  the company has periodically accessed the secondary equity and debt markets  and the company may need to continue to do so in order to support future growth or to meet existing operating and debt service requirements even in the absence of significant future growth 
the company s ability to access these capital markets successfully in the future will depend on numerous factors  including the company s financial performance  stock market performance  changes in interest rates  any changes in the company s credit ratings and perceptions in the capital markets regarding the death care industry and the company s performance and future prospects 
in addition to the factors discussed above  earnings per share may be affected by other important factors  including the following a the ability of the company to achieve projected economies of scale in markets where it has clusters or combined facilities 
b whether recently acquired businesses perform at pro forma levels used by management in the valuation process and whether  and the rate at which  management is able to increase the profitability of these recently acquired businesses 
c the ability of the company to manage its growth in terms of implementing internal controls and information gathering systems  and retaining or attracting key personnel  among other things 
d the amount and rate of growth in the company s general and administrative expenses 
e changes in interest rates and the company s credit ratings  which can increase or decrease the interest rates the company pays on borrowings with variable rates of interest and the rates it will be required to pay on new fixed or variable rate debt 
f the company s debt to equity ratio  the number of shares of common stock outstanding and the portion of the company s debt that has fixed or variable interest rates 
g the impact on the company s financial statements of nonrecurring accounting charges that may result from the company s ongoing evaluation of its business strategies  asset valuations and organizational structures 
h changes in government regulation  including tax rates and their effects on corporate structure 
i changes in inflation and other general economic conditions both domestically and internationally  affecting financial markets eg marketable security values as well as exchange rate fluctuations 
j unanticipated legal proceedings and unanticipated outcomes of legal proceedings 
k changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily or required to be adopted by generally accepted accounting principles
