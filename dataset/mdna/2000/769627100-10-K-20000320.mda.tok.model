management believes that cash flow from operations  combined with the million cash and short term investments  will be sufficient to cover the company s debt service and enable investment in budgeted capital expenditures for the next twelve months including completion of the black hawk casino development 
cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to pay of the principal of the million notes at maturity on august  and the million notes at maturity on may  accordingly  the ability of the company and its subsidiary to repay the notes at maturity will be dependent upon its ability to refinance those notes 
there can be no assurance that the company and its subsidiary will be able to refinance the principal amount of the notes at maturity 
the notes are not redeemable at the option of the company until august   and thereafter are redeemable at premiums beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in although riviera black hawk  inc can  at any time prior to may   redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at with the proceeds of a qualified public offering  the subsidiary may not redeem of the notes until may   at premiums beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in the and note indentures provide that  in certain circumstances  the company and its subsidiary must offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other events 
in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  the company and its subsidiary would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the note indenture contains certain covenants  which limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries and its unrestricted subsidiary riviera black hawk  inc under the notes indenture  subject to certain exceptions  to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  iii enter into certain transactions with affiliates  iv create certain liens  sell certain assets  and v enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
as a result of these restrictions  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or to make capital expenditures is limited 
in the event that cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover cash requirements  the company and its subsidiaries would be required to curtail or defer certain of their capital expenditure programs under these circumstances  which could have an adverse effect on operations 
at december   the company believes that it is in compliance with the covenants
