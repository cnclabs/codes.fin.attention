item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected certain aspects of the company s financial position and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report 
overview dril quip manufactures highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment which is well suited for use in deepwater  harsh environment and severe service applications 
the company designs and manufactures subsea equipment  surface equipment and offshore rig equipment for use by major integrated  large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world 
the company s principal products consist of subsea and surface wellheads  subsea and surface production trees  mudline hanger systems  specialty connectors and associated pipe  drilling and production riser systems  wellhead connectors and diverters 
dril quip also provides installation and reconditioning services and rents running tools for use in connection with the installation and retrieval of its products 
both the market for offshore drilling and production equipment and services and the company s business are substantially dependent on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration  drilling and production operations offshore 
oil and gas prices and the level of offshore drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
the decline in worldwide offshore exploration and production activity which began in continued during this reduction in offshore activity occurred as oil and gas companies reduced their budgets in response to low oil prices that began in and continued through the first half of consequently  demand for dril quip products  particularly those products used in drilling and producing economically marginal properties  declined 
although oil prices rebounded in the last half of  any future decline in hydrocarbon prices would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the current oil price levels will lead to increased oil and gas exploration and production activity or that demand for the company s products and services will reflect such improvement  if any 
the company operates its business and markets its products and services in all of the significant oil and gas producing areas in the world and is  therefore  subject to the risks customarily attendant to international operations and investments in foreign countries 
these risks include nationalization  expropriation  war and civil disturbance  restrictive action by local governments  limitation on repatriation of earnings  change in foreign tax laws and change in currency exchange rates  any of which could have an adverse effect on either the company s ability to manufacture its products in its facilities abroad or the demand in certain regions for the company s products or both 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant problems in foreign countries arising from local government actions or political instability  but there is no assurance that such problems will not arise in the future 
interruption of the company s international operations could have a material adverse effect on its overall operations 
dril quip s revenues are generated by its two operating groups the product group and the service group 
the product group manufactures offshore drilling and production equipment  and the service group provides installation and reconditioning services as well as rental running tools for installation and retrieval of its products 
in  the company derived of its revenues from the sale of its products and of its revenues from services 
revenues from the service group generally correlate to revenues from product sales  because increased product sales generate increased revenues from installation services and rental running tools 
the company has substantial international operations  with approximately  and of its revenues derived from foreign sales in  and  respectively 
during the same years  approximately of all products sold were manufactured in the united states 
historically  drip quip recognized revenues upon the delivery of a completed product 
beginning in  the company began receiving orders relating to larger and more complex projects that have longer manufacturing time frames 
the company accounts for such projects on a percentage of completion basis and revenues are generally recognized on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated costs 
accordingly  price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in the period when such estimates are revised 
the principal elements of cost of sales are labor  raw materials and manufacturing overhead 
variable costs  such as labor  raw materials  supplies and energy  generally account for approximately two thirds of the company s cost of sales 
the company has experienced increased labor costs over the past few years due to the limited supply of skilled workers 
fixed costs  such as the fixed portion of manufacturing overhead  constitute the remainder of the company s cost of sales 
the company continually seeks to improve its efficiency and cost position 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues is also influenced by the product mix sold in any particular quarter and market conditions 
the company s costs related to its foreign operations do not significantly differ from its domestic costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues product group service group total cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses engineering and product development expenses operating income interest expense income income before income taxes income tax provision net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by million  or approximately  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to depressed oil prices that began in and continued through the first half of  which led to worldwide exploration and production budget cuts by most major oil companies 
these reductions have resulted in pricing pressure and lower demand for dril quip products 
revenue decreases of million and million in the european area and the asia pacific area  respectively  were offset by increased sales in the united states area of million 
domestic sales in the united states area increased by million  or  while export sales in the united states area decreased by million  or 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in however  as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased from in to in  primarily due to pricing pressure resulting from lower demand for dril quip products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for both the twelve months ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expenses were million selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from in to approximately in engineering and product development expenses 
during the year ended december   engineering and product development expenses decreased by thousand  or  to million from million during the same period in this decrease primarily reflects a decreased number of personnel 
as a percentage of revenues  engineering and product development expenses increased slightly from in to approximately in interest expense income 
interest income for was thousand  compared to interest income of million for the prior year 
this change was primarily due to lower cash balances resulting from reduced operating income and the company using the proceeds from its initial public offering to fund capital expenditures 
net income 
net income decreased by million  or  from million in to million in for the reasons set forth above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million in from million in this increase relates to increased sales in the united states area of million  decreased revenues of million in the european area and decreased sales of million in the asia pacific area 
domestic sales in the united states area increased by million  or  while export sales in the united states area increased by million  or 
these increases were mainly due to increased manufacturing capacity and increased sales of new products related to larger and longer term projects 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased from in to in this decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to strong market demand for new products related to larger and longer term projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the twelve months ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million from million in the period 
this increase was due to an increased number of personnel needed to support higher sales volumes and increased labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from in to approximately in engineering and product development expenses 
during the year ended december   engineering and product development expenses increased by million  or  to million from million during the same period in this increase primarily reflects an increased number of personnel  and to a lesser extent  increased development testing related to new products 
as a percentage of revenues  engineering and product development expenses increased from in to approximately in interest expense income 
interest income for was million  compared to interest expense of million for the prior year 
this change was primarily due to the repayment of substantially all of the company s bank debt during the fourth quarter of and interest income earned on cash generated by the offering 
net income 
net income increased by million  or  from million in to million in for the reasons set forth above 
liquidity and capital resources the primary liquidity needs of the company are i to fund capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity  improve and expand facilities and manufacture additional rental running tools and ii to fund working capital 
the company s principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations and bank indebtedness 
however  as a result of the company s october initial public offering of common stock  all of the company s bank indebtedness was repaid in since that time  the company has used the remaining proceeds from the initial public offering and cash flows from operations as its principal sources of funds 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in improvements in cash flow from operating activities in were principally the result of decreased working capital requirements attributable to decreases in trade receivables and inventories  offset by decreases in trade accounts payable  accrued expenses and net income 
the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in was the result of a substantial increase in accounts receivable  offset by improved operating results 
accounts receivable at december  decreased over december  levels compared to a decrease in revenues for the year 
the disproportionate decrease in accounts receivable was due to timing of cash receipts and billings related to long term projects 
capital expenditures by the company were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
principal payments on long term debt were million  thousand and thousand in  and  respectively 
on august   the company entered into a credit agreement with bank one  texas  na which provides for an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to million 
at the election of the company  borrowing under this facility bears interest at either a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus or the bank one base rate 
in addition  the facility calls for quarterly interest payments and terminates on august  to date  there have been no drawdowns under this facility 
the company believes that cash on hand plus cash generated from operations in conjunction with its existing revolving line of credit  if necessary will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs and anticipated capital expenditure requirements 
however  should the above mentioned market conditions result in unexpected cash requirements  the company believes that additional borrowing from commercial lending institutions would be readily available and more than adequate to meet such requirements 
backlog backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase order has been received  satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled 
the company s backlog was approximately million at december  and was approximately million at december  this decrease in backlog was primarily attributable to reduced demand for dril quip products resulting from the decline in worldwide exploration and production activity 
the company expects to fill approximately of the december  backlog by december  the remaining backlog at december  consists of longer term projects that will be designed and manufactured to customer specifications rather than sold out of inventory 
the company can give no assurance that backlog will remain at current levels 
sales of the company s products are affected by prices for oil and natural gas  which fluctuated significantly during and any future decline in oil and natural gas prices could reduce new customer orders  which would cause the company s backlog to decline 
all of the company s projects currently included in its backlog are subject to change and or termination at the option of the customer 
in the case of a change or termination  the customer is required to pay the company for work performed and other costs necessarily incurred as a result of the change or termination 
geographic areas the company s operations are divided into three geographic areas based upon the locations of its manufacturing facilities the united states houston  texas  europe  middle east and africa aberdeen  scotland and asia pacific singapore 
the united states area includes sales to both north and south america 
the area of europe  middle east and africa includes primarily sales to the north sea  the middle east and africa 
the asia pacific area includes sales primarily to australia  thailand  malaysia and indonesia 
revenues for each of these areas are dependent upon the ultimate sale of products and services to the company s customers 
for information on revenues by geographic area  see note notes to consolidated financial statements and supplementary data on page revenues of the united states area are also influenced by its sale of products to the european and asia pacific subsidiaries 
accordingly  the operating incomes of each area are closely tied to third party sales  and the operating income of the united states area is also dependent upon its level of intercompany sales 
currency risk through its subsidiaries  the company conducts a portion of business in currencies other than the united states dollar  principally the british pound sterling and the norwegian kroner 
the company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the company s estimated operating costs payable in local currency and in us dollars for the balance of the contract and by contractual purchase price adjustments based on an exchange rate formula related to us dollars 
because of this strategy  the company has not experienced significant transaction gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates and does not anticipate such exposure to be material in the future 
in  the company had an exchange gain  net of income taxes  of approximately million 
in and  the company had net losses of approximately thousand and thousand  respectively 
the gain in was primarily related to the repayment of debt and the losses in and were the result of slight currency fluctuations on payables and trade receivables 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to protect itself against such fluctuations in the future 
historically  the company has not conducted business in countries that limit repatriation of earnings 
however  as the company expands its international operations  it may begin operating in countries that have such limitations 
further  there can be no assurance that the countries in which the company currently operates will not adopt policies limiting repatriation of earnings in the future 
the company also has significant investments in countries other than the united states  principally its manufacturing operations in aberdeen  scotland and  to a lesser extent  singapore 
the functional currency of these foreign operations is the local currency and  accordingly  financial statement assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates 
resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity and have no current effect on earnings or cash flow 
year historically  certain computerized systems have used two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year  which could result in recognizing the date using as the year rather than the year the company experienced no critical failures during the date roll over from to  nor do we anticipate any critical failures during prior to the date roll over  the company addressed the year problem internally and progress was regularly reported to management and the board of directors 
the company completed assessment  remediation and testing phases of its year program in the areas of information systems and automated production systems prior to the date roll over 
the company had also contacted substantially all of its third party suppliers and vendors about their year readiness prior to the date roll over 
although the company believes that internal year issues pose no material threat to its business  results of operations or financial condition  we cannot predict the potential impact of any post roll over failures experienced by third parties critical to the company s operations 
post roll over year failures among critical third parties could possibly cause significant business interruptions 
at this time  we cannot quantify the potential impact of such failures 
for this reason  the company remains on alert for third party year failures 
the total cost of the company s year program prior to the date roll over was less than  and was not material to the company s operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the company does not expect any material additional costs 
costs have been handled within the current information systems budget  and no special allocations have been made
