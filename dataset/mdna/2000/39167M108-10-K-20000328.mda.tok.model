competition the company  through the bank subsidiaries  competes with other new jersey commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  insurance companies  and credit unions 
a substantial number of offices of competing financial institutions are located within the bank subsidiaries respective market areas 
the past trend toward consolidation of the banking industry has continued in new jersey in recent years 
this trend may make it more difficult for smaller banks such as the bank subsidiaries to compete with larger national and regional banking institutions 
several of the bank subsidiaries competitors are affiliated with major banking and financial institutions which are substantially larger and have far greater financial resources than the bank subsidiaries 
competitive factors between financial institutions can be classified into two categories competitive rates and competitive service 
rate competition is intense especially in the area of time deposits 
the bank subsidiaries compete with larger institutions with respect to the interest rates they offer 
from a service standpoint  the bank subsidiaries competitors  by virtue of their superior financial resources  have substantially greater lending limits than the bank subsidiaries 
such competitors also perform certain functions for their customers  such as trust and international services  which the bank subsidiaries have chosen not to provide 
supervision and regulation the banking industry is highly regulated 
statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company s cost of doing business  limit its management s options to deploy assets and maximize income and may significantly limit the activities of institutions which do not meet regulatory capital or other requirements 
areas subject to regulation and supervision by the bank regulatory agencies include  among others minimum capital levels  dividends  affiliate transactions  expansion of locations  acquisitions and mergers  reserves against deposits  deposit insurance premiums  credit underwriting standards  management and internal controls  investments  and general safety and soundness of banks and bank holding companies 
supervision  regulation and examination of the company and the bank subsidiaries by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the communities served by the institutions or other governmental interests  rather than for holders of stock of the company 
the following is a brief summary of certain statutes  rules and regulations affecting the company and the bank subsidiaries 
a number of other statutes and regulations and governmental policies have an impact on their operations 
the company is unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on its business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies  economic control or new federal or state legislation may have in the future 
the following summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
bank holding company regulation the company is registered as a bank holding company under the holding company act 
as such  it is subject to regular examination  supervision and regulation by the federal reserve 
the company is required to file reports with the federal reserve and to furnish such additional information as the federal reserve may require pursuant to the holding company act 
the company also is subject to regulation by the department 
a policy of the federal reserve requires the company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support them 
in addition  any loans by the company to the bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiaries 
at december   the company had approximately million in financial resources in addition to its investment in the bank subsidiaries and nonbank subsidiaries 
the federal reserve has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies which require them to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
holding company activities with certain exceptions  the holding company act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain nonbank activities which  by statute or by federal reserve regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking 
the company s activities are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the holding company act and related federal reserve regulations 
satisfactory capital ratios and community reinstatement act cra ratings are generally prerequisites to obtaining regulatory approval to make acquisitions 
the financial modernization act of  discussed below see recent legislation  allows the company to expand into insurance  securities  merchant banking and other activities that are financial in nature 
the federal interstate banking and branching act of permits a bank holding company to acquire banks in states other than its home state  regardless of applicable state law 
the law also permits banks to create interstate branches  either by merging across state lines or by creating new branches  subject to a state s ability to opt out of these enabling provisions 
as have most states  new jersey has enacted legislation to authorize interstate banking either by merger or by branching into new jersey if the foreign bank already has branches in new jersey  however  that legislation did not authorize de novo branching into new jersey 
recent legislation during november   the president signed the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of into law 
under the new act  effective march bank holding companies meeting standards as to management  capital and community reinvestment act compliance will be permitted to engage in a substantially broader range of nonbanking activities than has previously been permissible  including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies 
if a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company  it files a certification  effective in days  and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals 
insurers and other financial services companies are allowed to acquire banks 
various restrictions currently applicable to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies are removed 
a new overall regulatory structure is established for bank holding companies also engaged in insurance and securities operations 
on january   the federal reserve adopted an interim rule allowing bank holding companies to submit certifications by february to become financial holding companies on march  the federal reserve also established procedures which would be used against financial holding companies which have depository institutions which have fallen out of compliance with the management or capital criteria 
only financial holding companies can own insurance companies and engage in merchant banking 
the modernization act also modifies other current financial laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
notwithstanding the federal reserve s prior approval of specific nonbanking activities  the federal reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are also prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of any property or services 
holding company dividends and stock repurchases the federal reserve has the power to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if their actions are deemed to constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the federal reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies 
it is the federal reserve s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with its capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
as a bank holding company  the company is required to give the federal reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding months  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve order  directive  or any condition imposed by or written agreement with  the federal reserve 
bank regulation as state chartered banks which are not members of the federal reserve system  the bank subsidiaries are subject to the primary federal supervision of the fdic under the federal deposit insurance act the fdia 
prior approval of the fdic is required for the bank subsidiaries to establish or relocate a branch office or to engage in any merger  consolidation or significant purchase or sale of assets 
the bank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation and supervision by the department 
in addition  they are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations which set forth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the establishment of branches  investments  interest rates on loans  credit practices  the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions 
the fdic and the department regularly examine the operations of the respective bank subsidiaries and their condition  including capital adequacy  reserves  loans  investments and management practices 
these examinations are for the protection of the bank subsidiaries depositors and the bank insurance fund bif and not the company 
the bank subsidiaries are also required to furnish quarterly and annual reports to the fdic 
the fdic s enforcement authority includes the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue orders to prevent a bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business 
the fdic has adopted regulations regarding the capital adequacy of banks subject to its primary supervision 
such regulations require those banks to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
see regulatory capital requirements  below 
statewide branching is permitted in new jersey 
branch approvals are subject to statutory standards relating to safety and soundness  competition  public convenience and cra performance 
community reinvestment act under the cra  the subsidiary banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with their safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
gfb and bcb received satisfactory cra ratings in their most recent examinations 
bank dividends new jersey law permits the bank subsidiaries to declare dividends only if  after payment of the dividends  their capital would be unimpaired and their remaining surplus would equal at least of their capital 
under the fdia  the bank subsidiaries are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or making any other capital distribution if  after that distribution  they would fail to meet their regulatory capital requirements 
at december   the bank subsidiaries met their regulatory capital requirements 
the fdic also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the fdic may prohibit bank holding companies of banks which are deemed to be significantly undercapitalized under the fdia or which fail to properly submit and implement capital restoration plans required by the fdia from paying dividends or making other capital distributions without the fdic s permission 
see holding company dividends and stock repurchases  above 
restrictions upon intercompany transactions the bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to  and certain other transactions with  the company and other affiliates 
such restrictions prevent the company and its affiliates from borrowing from the bank subsidiaries unless the loans are secured by specified collateral  and require such transactions to have terms comparable to terms of arms length transactions with third persons 
such transactions by each of the bank subsidiaries are generally limited in amount as to the company and as to any other affiliate to of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus 
as to the company and all other affiliates  such transactions are limited to an aggregate of of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus 
these regulations and restrictions may limit the company s ability to obtain funds from the bank subsidiaries for its cash needs  including funds for acquisitions and for payment of dividends  interest and operating expenses 
real estate lending guidelines under fdic regulations  state banks must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for real estate lending activities 
these policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards  prudent underwriting standards including loan to value limits that are clear and measurable  loan administration procedures and documentation  approval and reporting requirements 
a bank s real estate lending policy must reflect consideration of the interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies adopted by federal bank regulators 
deposit insurance since the bank subsidiaries are fdic member institutions  their respective deposits are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through the bif  administered by the fdic 
the bank subsidiaries are also required to pay deposit insurance premiums to the fdic 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia included provisions to reform the federal deposit insurance system  including the implementation of risk based deposit insurance premiums 
fdicia permits the fdic to make special assessments on insured depository institutions in amounts determined by the fdic to be necessary to give it adequate assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the us treasury and other sources or for any other purpose the fdic deems necessary 
under a risk based insurance premium system which became permanent in  banks are assessed insurance premiums according to how much risk they are deemed to present to the bif 
banks with higher levels of capital and involving a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital and or involving a higher degree of supervisory concern 
specifically  the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends upon the risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic based upon the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized 
well capitalized institutions are institutions satisfying the following capital ratio standards i total risk based capital ratios of or greater  ii tier i risk based capital ratios of or greater  and iii tier i leverage ratios of or greater 
adequately capitalized institutions are institutions that do not meet the standards for well capitalized institutions but that satisfy the following capital ratio standards i total risk based capital ratios of or greater  ii tier i risk based capital ratios of or greater  and iii tier i leverage ratios of or greater 
undercapitalized institutions consist of institutions that do not qualify as either well capitalized or adequately capitalized 
within each capital group  institutions are assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the fdic determines to be relevant 
effective january  the assessment rates ranged from to of deposits 
the bank subsidiaries deposit assessment rates were in and in addition  the deposit insurance act of authorized the financing corporation fico to levy assessments on bif assessable deposits and stipulated that the rate must equal one fifth the fico assessment rate that is applied to deposits assessable by the savings association insurance fund saif 
the rates established for gfb and bcb for through are and  respectively 
standards for safety and soundness under fdicia  each federal banking agency is required to prescribe noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
the federal banking agencies  including the federal reserve and the fdic  have adopted interagency guidelines which cover internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees  benefits  and standards for asset quality and earnings sufficiency 
an institution which fails to meet any of these standards may be required to develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
the company believes that the bank subsidiaries meet all adopted standards 
enforcement powers the bank regulatory agencies have broad discretion to issue cease and desist orders if they determine that the company or its bank subsidiaries are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices 
in addition  the federal bank regulatory authorities may impose substantial civil money penalties for violations of certain federal banking statutes and regulations  violation of a fiduciary duty  or violation of a final or temporary cease and desist orders  among other things 
financial institutions and a broad range of persons associated with them are subject to the imposition of fines  penalties  and other enforcement actions based upon the conduct of their relationships with the institutions 
the fdic may be appointed as a conservator or receiver for a depository institution based upon a number of events and circumstances 
the fdic as a conservator or receiver of a depository institution also has express authority to repudiate most contracts with such institution which it determines to be burdensome or if such repudiation will promote the orderly administration of the institution s affairs 
the fdic is also given authority to enforce contracts made by a depository institution notwithstanding any contractual provision providing for termination  default  acceleration  or exercise of rights upon  or solely by reason of  insolvency or the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
insured depository institutions also are prohibited from entering into contracts for goods  products or services which would adversely affect their safety and soundness 
regulatory capital requirements the federal reserve and the fdic have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding companies and state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system state nonmember banks 
the regulations impose two sets of capital adequacy requirements minimum leverage rules  which require maintenance of a specified minimum ratio of capital to total assets  and risk based capital rules  which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
these regulations require bank holding companies and state nonmember banks to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets of 
although setting a minimum leverage ratio  the capital regulations state that only the strongest bank holding companies and banks  with composite examination ratings of under the rating system used by the federal bank regulators  would be permitted to operate at or near such minimum level of capital 
all other bank holding companies and banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to above the minimum ratio  depending on the assessment of an individual organization s capital adequacy by its primary regulator 
any bank or bank holding company experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital well above the minimum levels 
in addition  the federal reserve has indicated that whenever appropriate  and in particular when a bank holding company is undertaking expansion  seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise facing unusual or abnormal risks  it will consider  on a case by case basis  the level of an organization s ratio of tangible tier i capital after deducting all intangibles to total assets in making an overall assessment of capital 
the risk based capital rules require bank holding companies and state nonmember banks to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels based upon a weighting of their assets and off balance sheet obligations according to risk 
the risk based capital rules have two basic components a tier i or core capital requirement and a tier ii or supplementary capital requirement 
tier i capital consists primarily of common stockholders equity  certain perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less most intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
tier ii capital elements include  subject to certain limitations  the allowance for losses on loans and leases  perpetual preferred stock that does not qualify for tier i and long term preferred stock with an original maturity of at least years from issuance  hybrid capital instruments  including perpetual debt and mandatory convertible securities  and subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock 
the risk based capital regulations assign balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet obligations to one of four broad risk categories based principally on the degree of credit risk associated with the obligor 
the assets and off balance sheet items in the four risk categories are weighted at   and 
these computations result in the total risk weighted assets 
the risk based capital regulations require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of  with at least as core capital 
for the purpose of calculating these ratios  i supplementary capital is limited to no more than of core capital  and ii the aggregate amount of certain types of supplementary capital is limited 
in addition  the risk based capital regulations limit the allowance for loan losses which may be included as capital to of total risk weighted assets 
at december   the company s total risk based capital and leverage capital ratios were and  respectively 
the minimum levels established by the regulators for these measures are and  respectively 
fdicia also required the federal banking regulators to classify insured depository institutions by capital levels and to take various prompt corrective actions to resolve the problems of any institution that fails to satisfy the capital standards 
under fdicia and its prompt corrective action regulations  all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
under the fdic s prompt corrective action regulation  a well capitalized bank is one that is not subject to any regulatory order or directive to meet any specific capital level and that has or exceeds the following capital levels a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
an adequately capitalized bank is one that does not qualify as well capitalized but meets or exceeds the following capital requirements a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of either or if the bank has the highest composite examination rating 
a bank not meeting these criteria will be treated as undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized depending on the extent to which the bank s capital levels are below these standards 
a bank that falls within any of the three undercapitalized categories established by the prompt corrective action regulation will be i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters  under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized institution  as well as any undercapitalized institution that did not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  will be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization  broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates  limitations on interest rates paid on deposits  asset growth and other activities  possible replacement of directors and officers  and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution 
any company controlling the institution may be required to divest its interest in the institution 
if an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below a critical capital level established by the appropriate federal banking regulator  the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership unless periodic determinations are made that forbearance from such action would better protect the deposit insurance fund 
effect of government monetary policies  possible further legislation the company s earnings are and will be affected by domestic and international economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and foreign governments and their agencies 
the federal reserve s monetary policies have had  and will probably continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order  among other things  to curb inflation or combat a recession 
the federal reserve has a major effect upon the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of banks and the imposition of nonearning reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
from time to time  proposals are made in the united states congress  the new jersey legislature  and various bank regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of  and place restrictions on  different types of banking organizations 
it is impossible to predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted and any impact of such adoption on the business of the company and or the bank subsidiaries 
the bank subsidiaries are also subject to various federal and state laws such as usury laws and consumer protection laws 
employees as of december   the company employed a total of approximately employees  including full time employees 
management considers relations with employees to be satisfactory

results of operations fiscal years ended december   and the results of operations for the year ended december  were significantly affected by the purchase of first savings on april  the company earned million or per diluted share  a increase over million or per diluted share earned during excluding gains on the sale of investment securities and non recurring expenses of million related to the purchase of first savings incurred in the second quarter of  net income for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million in the company earned million or per diluted share in  which included  in gains on sale of investment securities 
cash earnings earnings before amortization of intangible assets per diluted share were  and for the years ending december   and  respectively 
the increase in net income for the year ended december  primarily reflects higher net interest income and higher gain on the sale of investment securities and other income  partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits  all other expenses including amortization of intangible assets and other charges related to the acquisition of first savings  and higher provisions for possible loan losses and income taxes 
net operating losses from rcb for its first nine months of operations were  average balances and net interest income net interest income  the primary source of the company s results of operations  is the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets include loans to businesses and individuals  investment securities  interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold in the interbank market 
interest bearing liabilities include primarily interest bearing demand  savings and time deposits 
net interest income is determined by the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s interest rate spread is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets

provision for possible loan losses the company recorded a provision for possible loan losses of  in compared with  in and  on management of each bank subsidiary regularly performs an analysis to identify the inherent risk of loss in its loan portfolio 
this analysis includes evaluation of concentrations of credit  past loss experience  current economic conditions  amount and composition of the loan portfolio including loans being specifically monitored by management  estimated fair value of underlying collateral  loan commitments outstanding  delinquencies  and other factors 
the bank subsidiaries will continue to monitor their allowance for possible loan losses and make future adjustments to the allowance through the provision for possible loan losses as economic conditions dictate 
although the bank subsidiaries maintain their allowances for possible loan losses at levels that they consider to be adequate to provide for the inherent risk of loss in their loan portfolios  there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts or that additional provisions for possible loan losses will not be required in future periods 
in addition  the bank subsidiaries determinations as to the amount of their allowances for possible loan losses are subject to review by the fdic and the department  as part of their examination process  which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the fdic or the department  after a review of the information available at the time of their examination

asset quality various degrees of risk are associated with substantially all investing activities 
the lending function  however  carries the greatest risk of loss 
the senior lending officers of bcb  gfb and rcb are charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and seeking consistent application of these procedures 
nonperforming assets include past due  nonaccrual and renegotiated and other real estate loans 
since lending is concentrated within the local market area  nonperforming loans were also made primarily to customers operating in the area 
the degree of risk inherent in all lending activities is influenced heavily by general economic conditions in the immediate market area 
among the factors which tend to affect portfolio risks are changes in local or regional real estate values  income levels and energy prices 
these factors  coupled with unemployment levels and tax rates  as well as governmental actions and weakened market conditions which reduce the demand for credit among qualified borrowers  are also important determinants of the risk inherent in lending 
past due  nonaccruing and renegotiated loans 
it is the company s policy to review monthly all loans which are past due as to principal or interest 
the accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when it is determined that such loans are either doubtful of collection or are involved in a protracted collection process 
the current year s uncollected interest is reversed on such nonaccrual loans 
management has also restructured the terms of certain loans to accommodate changes in the financial condition of borrowers 
a typical concession would be a reduction in the currently payable interest rate to one which is lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risks  interest foregone would be deferred until maturity 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company s nonperforming assets and related asset quality ratios as of the dates indicated

nonperforming assets to total gross loans and other real estate owned 
nonperforming assets to total assets 


allowance for possible loan losses to nonperforming loans 
nonperforming loans increased by  at december  compared to december  the increase is primarily due to the reclassification of certain loans from current loans to either nonaccruing or renegotiated status 
nonperforming loans decreased by  at december  compared to december  the decrease is primarily due to the reclassification of certain loans from nonaccruing or renegotiated status to current loans 
if the nonaccruing loans in  and had continued to pay interest  interest income during the same years would have increased by   and  respectively 
potential problem loans 
as part of the loan review process  management routinely identifies performing loans where there is a doubt as to whether the borrowers will comply with the original loan repayment terms and allocates specific reserves against them 
at december  and  such loans totaled million and million with an allowance of million and  respectively  specifically allocated to them 
foreign loans 
the company has no foreign loans or any other foreign exposure 
allowance for possible loan losses at december   the allowance for possible loan losses was million as compared to million at december   an increase of million of which  arose from the acquisition of first savings 
the allowance for possible loan losses is increased periodically through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for possible loan losses 
loans that are deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance and any recoveries of such loans are credited to it 
it is management s belief that  although charge offs may occur in the future  there are adequate reserves allotted 
the level of the allowance is based on the ongoing evaluation by management of the respective bank subsidiaries of potential losses in the loan portfolio 
such evaluation includes consideration of the current financial status and credit standing of borrowers  prior loss experiences  results of periodic regulatory examinations  comments and recommendations of the company s independent accountants  and management s judgment as to prevailing and anticipated real estate values and other economic conditions in the bank subsidiaries market areas 
since future events that may affect these financial conditions are unpredictable  there is uncertainty as to the final outcome of the bank subsidiaries loans and nonperforming assets

the trust preferred securities do not have a maturity date and are callable by the company on or about june   or earlier if certain contingencies arise 
the debentures mature in the year  at which time the trust preferred securities must be redeemed 
interest rate sensitivity banks are concerned with the extent to which they are able to match maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
such matching is facilitated by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will mature or reprice within a specific time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the excess of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period over interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
the bank subsidiaries monitor their gaps on a monthly basis  primarily their six month and one year maturities  and work to maintain their gaps within a range of to 
the company had a negative one year gap position with respect to its exposure to interest rate risk at december  the asset liability management committees of the bank subsidiaries respective boards of directors meet quarterly to discuss their interest rate risks 
the company uses simulation models to measure the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the net interest income  balance sheet mix and the spread relationship between market rates and bank products 
as described below  sudden changes in interest rates should not have a material impact to the bank subsidiaries results of operations 
should the bank subsidiaries experience a positive or negative mismatch in excess of the approved range  they have a number of remedial options 
they have the ability to reposition their investment portfolios to include securities with more advantageous repricing and or maturity characteristics 
they can attract variable or fixed rate loan products as appropriate 
they can also price deposit products to attract deposits with maturity characteristics that can lower their exposures to interest rate risk

during the last two years the company has been highly liquid and its liquid funds are more than sufficient to meet future loan demand or the possible outflow of deposits in addition to being able to adapt to changing interest rate conditions 
management expects this high liquidity trend to continue until overall economic conditions improve and loan demand rises 
sources of liquidity at december  totaled million or of total assets  consisting of investment securities of million and million in cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing due from banks 
by comparison  total liquidity sources at december   were million or of total assets  consisting of investment securities in the amount of million and cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing due from banks in the amount of million 
capital resources the company s primary regulator  the federal reserve which regulates bank holding companies  has issued guidelines classifying and defining bank holding company capital into the following components tier i capital  which includes tangible shareholders equity for common stock and certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock  and tier ii capital  which includes a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses  certain qualifying long term debt and preferred stock that does not qualify as tier ii capital 
the risk based capital guidelines require financial institutions to maintain specific defined credit risk factors risk adjusted assets 
as of december   the minimum tier i and the combined tier i and tier ii capital ratios required by the federal reserve board for capital adequacy purposes were and  respectively 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines discussed above  the federal reserve requires that a bank holding company which meets that regulator s highest performance and operating standards maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percentage of tangible assets of 
those bank holding companies anticipating significant growth are expected to maintain a leverage ratio above the minimum ratio 
minimum leverage ratios for each entity will be evaluated through the ongoing regulatory examination process 
regulations have also been issued by the bank subsidiaries primary regulator  the fdic  establishing similar risk based and leverage capital ratios which apply to each bank as a separate entity

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
