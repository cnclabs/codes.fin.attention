item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading national distributor of natural foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the acquisition of or merger with natural products distributors  the expansion of existing distribution centers and the continued growth of the natural products industry in general 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
our distribution operations are divided into four principal units united natural foods in the eastern region previously cornucopia natural foods  inc and stow mills  inc  mountain people s warehouse  inc 
in the western region  rainbow natural foods  inc in the central region and albert s organics in various markets in the united states 
through our subsidiary  the natural retail group  we also own and operate retail natural products stores located in the eastern united states 
we believe our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business enabling us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
hershey import co  located in rahway  new jersey  is a business that specializes in the international trading  roasting and packaging of nuts  seeds  dried fruits and snack items 
we are continually integrating certain operating functions in order to improve operating efficiencies  including i integrating administrative and accounting functions  ii expanding marketing and customer service programs across the three regions  iii expanding national purchasing opportunities  iv consolidating systems applications between physical locations and regions  and v reducing geographic overlap between regions 
in addition  our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
we have made considerable capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the expansion of our facilities  including the expansion of our los angeles and auburn  california  and new oxford  pennsylvania locations 
upon completion of the new oxford expansion early next year  approximately of our distribution facility capacity will have been added over the past years 
while operating margins may be affected in periods in which these expenses are incurred  over the long term  we expect to benefit from the increased absorption of our expenses over a larger sales base 
we have incurred considerable expenses in connection with the planned consolidation of operations in the eastern region  which was to have resulted in the closure of our chesterfield  new hampshire facility 
these expenses consisted of the cost of moving inventory  as well as additional temporary expenses for information technology  inventory management and redundant staffing and transportation 
our operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal and all of fiscal were negatively impacted by computer and related issues arising from the consolidation of eastern region operations 
the consolidation resulted in increased operating expenses  a lower gross margin and lower sales than prior quarters in the eastern region 
due to the continuing difficulties in the consolidation  our management decided in december to keep our chesterfield facility open for the foreseeable future 
additionally  we closed our chicago facility during the third quarter of fiscal most of our existing chicago volume is now serviced from our aurora  colorado facility 
we do not expect the closure of our chicago facility to have material impact on our results of operations of financial condition 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amount paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  administrative  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
our operating margin excluding restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal was due to computer and related issues arising from the consolidation of operations in the eastern region which resulted in increased operating expenses  a lower gross margin and lower sales than prior quarters in the eastern region 
as a result of these problems fiscal was a rebuilding year for us 
our operating margins continued to suffer in the first quarter 
and the second quarter 
excluding non recurring charges of approximately million of fiscal due to our effort to reduce expenses  improve margin and increase sales our operating margin improved to excluding non recurring charges of approximately million in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter 
recent acquisitions on september   we acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of albert s organics  inc  a business specializing in the purchase  sale and distribution of produce and other perishable items  for million  including million of goodwill which we are amortizing over years 
albert s had sales of million for the fiscal year ended december  and provides us with additional expertise in the purchasing of produce and other perishable items 
albert s also makes available to us a number of cross selling opportunities  which will be mutually beneficial to both businesses 
the acquisition of albert s has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  all financial information has been included since the date of acquisition 
our merger with stow mills in october has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  all information included herein is reported as though united natural and stow mills had been combined for all periods reported 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses merger and restructuring expenses amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense other  net total other expense income income before income taxes income taxes net income twelve months ended july  compared to twelve months ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  the overall increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales to existing customers  the sale of new product offerings and sales to new customers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in net sales from the natural retail group due to the sale of four stores and the closing of one store in april excluding the natural retail group s fiscal sales by the sold and closed stores  sales increased approximately for the year ended july  over the comparable prior year period 
this growth rate is lower than in past years 
the major factor contributing to our lower growth rate was loss of volume in the eastern region to other suppliers due to difficulties encountered in the consolidation effort 
another contributing factor was the closure of our chicago facility and the resulting inability to fully service this region from our aurora  co and new oxford  pa facilities  which resulted in combined lost sales for our third and fourth quarters of approximately million 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from ongoing difficulties with the eastern region consolidation  as well as an increased percentage of sales to existing customers under our volume discount program and the divestiture of four retail stores  which have higher gross margins than our distribution business 
difficulties in the eastern region which impacted our margin include higher than normal levels of customer returns and allowances  pricing errors  inventory shrink and higher inbound transportation costs for expedited shipments 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our operating expenses for the year ended july  were also impacted by approximately million of restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the write off of certain eastern region fixed assets and the closing of our chicago facility 
excluding fiscal restructuring and asset impairment costs of million and other special charges of million  and fiscal restructuring costs of million  total operating expenses for the years ended july  and would have been million or of net sales  and million or of net sales  respectively  resulting in an increase for the year ended july  of million  or over the comparable prior period 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the continuing difficulties in the eastern region  including redundant transportation expenses  reduced labor productivity  and outside storage expenses 
an increase in the cost of fuel of approximately million during the year impacted all of our distribution centers 
in addition  increased labor expenses related to the tight labor market limited our ability to attract and retain trained qualified employees in the eastern region particularly  but also affected all of our distribution centers 
operating income 
operating income decreased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in the year ended july  from in the comparable period 
excluding the restructuring  asset impairment and other special charges noted above  operating income for the year ended july  and would have been million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales  respectively  resulting in a decrease for the year ended july  of million versus the comparable prior period 
other income expense 
the million increase in other expense for the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was attributable to a million gain on the sale of retail stores in and higher interest expense of approximately million in  reflecting a higher level of debt for fiscal income taxes 
our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates for and were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and the settlement of an irs audit for million in net loss income 
as a result  net income decreased by million to a net loss of million  for the year ended july  from net income of million in the year ended july  excluding the million in restructuring costs million net of tax and the million in special charges million net of tax in fiscal and the million in restructuring costs million  net of tax  the million gain on the sale of four retail stores million  net of tax and the million irs settlement in fiscal  net income would have been million and million  respectively  resulting in a decrease for the year ended july  of million over the comparable prior period 
twelve months ended july  compared to twelve months ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  the overall increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales to existing customers  the sale of new product offerings and the newly acquired albert s organics business 
excluding albert s organics  our most recent acquisition  our net sales growth would have been over the prior year comparable period 
gross profit 
gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was consistent at for both years 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to for year ended july  from for the year ended july  excluding fiscal restructuring costs of million and fiscal merger costs of million  total operating expenses for the years ended july  and would have been million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  resulting in an increase for the year ended july  of million  or  over the comparable prior period 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  excluding restructuring and merger costs  was primarily due to increased information technology expenditures and additional business integration costs for redundant staffing and training related to the migration of the business from the chesterfield  new hampshire facility to the dayville  connecticut facility

other income expense 
the million decrease in other expense in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was primarily attributable to the million gain on the sale of four retail stores in april  partially offset by an increase in interest expense relating to the higher level of debt in fiscal used to fund working capital investments and the albert s acquisition 
this increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in our average interest rate on debt 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and the settlement of an irs audit for million 
the effective rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and non deductible merger expenses incurred in the first quarter of fiscal  partially offset by stow mills being an s corporation prior to the merger and  as such  having no federal tax expense for the first fiscal quarter of net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million to million  or of net sales  for the year ended july  from million in the year ended july  excluding the million in restructuring costs million  net of tax  the million gain on the sale of four retail stores million  net of tax and the million irs settlement in the third quarter of fiscal  and the million in merger costs in fiscal  net income would have been million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  resulting in an decrease for the year ended july  of million  or  over the comparable prior period 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed operations and growth primarily from cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  seller financing of acquisitions  operating and capital leases  trade payables  bank indebtedness and the sale of equity and debt securities 
primary uses of capital have been acquisitions  expansion of plant and equipment and investment in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash used by operations was million for the year ended july  net cash provided by operations was million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
excluding merger expenses of million  net cash provided by operations in fiscal would have been million 
cash used in operations in fiscal related primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and investments in inventory in the ordinary course of business 
days sales outstanding at july  has increased to approximately days from approximately days at july  the increases in inventory levels relate to supporting increased sales with wider product assortment combined with our ability to capture purchasing efficiency opportunities in excess of total carrying costs 
these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable

working capital at july  was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended july   and  respectively

our primary financing activities in fiscal were net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and proceeds of million from long term debt incurred

in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a five year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million 
the five year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years at the option of the counterparty 
impact of inflation historically  the company has been able to pass along inflation related increases 
consequently  inflation has not had a material impact upon the results of the company s operations or profitability 
seasonality generally  the company does not experience any material seasonality 
however  the company s sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in the company s operating expenses  management s ability to execute the company s operating and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages and general economic conditions

we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements  all of which are expressly qualified by the statement in this section 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
we merged with stow mills in october the successful integration of this merger is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
the integration will require  among other things o the optimization of delivery routes  o coordination of administrative  distribution and finance functions  and o the integration of personnel 
the integration process has and could continue to divert the attention of management and any further difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining the companies has and could continue to cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
there can be no assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of the stow mills merger 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
there can be no assurance that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in highly competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than us  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than united natural to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
we depend heavily on our principal customers our ability to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with our top two customers  whole foods market  inc and wild oats markets  inc  is important to the ongoing growth and profitability of our business 
whole foods and wild oats accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales during the fiscal year ended july  as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from either of these customers  including from increased distribution to their own facilities  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
no assurance can be given that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of super natural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts 
our industry is sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by o difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  o difficulties with inventory control  o competitive pricing pressures  and o unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of michael s 
funk  chief executive officer  richard s 
youngman  president  kevin michel  chief financial officer  and other key management employees 
norman a 
cloutier  our former chairman of the board and chief executive officer  resigned these positions on december  loss of the services of any additional officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to o changes in our operating expenses  o management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  o personnel changes  o demand for natural products  o supply shortages  o general economic conditions  o changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  o fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  o lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  o volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and o future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular o our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  o our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and o our trucking operations are regulated by the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our officers and directors and the employee stock ownership trust have significant voting power 
as of september   our executive officers and directors  and their affiliates  and the united natural foods employee stock ownership trust beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of united natural s common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  if acting together  may have the ability to impact the election of our directors and determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  depending on how other stockholders may vote 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of united natural 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of july   approximately employees  representing approximately of our approximately  employees  were union members 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
access to capital and the cost of that capital in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital 
in the event that capital market turmoil significantly increased our cost of capital or the ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital  we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
