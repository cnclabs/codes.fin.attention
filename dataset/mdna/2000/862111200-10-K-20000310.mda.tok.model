some of these risks are detailed below in factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this form k 
the forward looking statements contained herein represent a good faith assessment of the company s future performance for which management believes there is a reasonable basis 
the company disclaims any obligation to update information on forecasts contained herein  except as may be otherwise required by law 
historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing this form k with the securities and exchange commission and may be relied upon only as of that date 
general the company reported a net loss for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion  compared to net income for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion and net income for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion 
the company s reported results for include one time pre tax litigation expenses of million  restructuring expenses of million  and other related restructuring expenses of million 
excluding these one time expenses  net of tax  the company reported net income of million during revenue increased in  compared to  due to increases in revenue from storage services and storage management software 
revenue from storage products decreased in  compared to gross profit margins decreased to in compared to in  due to decreased profit margins in all of the company s business segments 
revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increases in revenue from storage services and storage management software 
gross profit margins increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to increased sales of higher margin storage management software 
the increased margins from storage management software were partially offset by decreased margins from storage services 
many of the company s customers undertake detailed procedures relating to the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of the company s products  software and services 
this evaluation process results in a variable sales cycle  and makes it difficult to predict if or when revenue will be earned 
further  gross margins may be adversely impacted in an effort to complete the sales cycle 
revenue and operating profits during fell significantly short of the company s expectations due principally to shortfalls in revenue and gross margins in north america and europe 
while revenue in north america and europe increased in compared to  gross margins declined in terms of both gross margin dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
the company believes a portion of this shortfall was due to some customers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of possible issues associated with the year  particularly with respect to tape products and virtual storage manager tm vsm targeted for the mainframe market 
delays in the introduction and market acceptance of these new products also impacted the company s financial results during the first half of the company s financial results may continue to be adversely impacted by its variable sales cycle  particularly in the first half of  as it implements changes to the sales model in the united states and canada 
future financial results are also dependent upon the company s ability to manage its costs and operating expenses in line with revenue  the timely development  manufacture and introduction of new products  software and services  successfully managing the development of new direct and indirect sales channels  the implementation of its storage area network san strategy  and the execution of its ongoing restructuring activities 
for the discussion of these and other risk factors  see factors that may affect future results  below 
in april  the company announced plans to restructure its business 
in october  the company announced additional restructuring plans 
these restructuring activities are intended to return the company to profitability 
as the company s restructuring activities are on going  the amount and timing of restructuring expenses which will be incurred during cannot be clearly determined at this time  however  these restructuring expenses are expected to materially affect the company s reported financial results during the company s sales revenue in the first half of may be adversely effected by disruptions to its sales organizations and customers associated with its restructuring activities 
the company estimates annual savings of approximately million were realized in connection with the april restructuring 
the company expects the activities associated with the october restructuring to be completed by the end of the second quarter of and the october restructuring is expected to yield annualized savings of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring activities described above will be successful or sufficient to allow the company to realize the expected annualized savings or return the company to profitability 
see restructuring  below for further discussion of the restructuring activities 
on october   the company announced that it had engaged an investment banking firm to assist the company in its on going analysis  evaluation and consideration of various strategic alternatives 
these strategic alternatives could have included financial restructurings  acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs  joint ventures  and business combinations including sales  mergers  or partnerships 
on february   the company announced that the board of directors had concluded that the company was most likely to maximize shareholder value by continuing to operate as an independent entity and by executing the current restructuring activities 
the company s cash balance decreased million in due primarily to litigation payments of million and restructuring payments of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of litigation and restructuring  respectively 
excluding the effects of these one time payments  the company s operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash of million generated from operations in the increase in cash generated from operations in  compared to  was primarily the result of progress in the company s efforts to more effectively manage working capital 
see liquidity and capital resources working capital for additional discussion of operating cash flows 
cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to property  plant and equipment purchases of million 
cash used in financing activities of million was mainly the result of cash payments of million associated with repurchases of common stock largely offset by cash receipts of million from employee stock plans 
the following table  stated as a percentage of total revenue  presents consolidated statement of operations information and revenue by segment 
year ended december storage products tape products disk products network products total storage products storage services storage management software total revenue cost of revenue gross profit research and product development costs selling  general  administrative and other income and expense  net litigation expense restructuring expense operating profit loss interest income expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss revenue storage products the company s storage products revenue includes sales of tape  disk  and network products for the mainframe and client server marketplaces 
revenue generated from storage products decreased in  compared to  and increased in  compared to tape products tape product revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased sales of the high performance tape drive  increased sales of the timberwolf tm family of automated tape products designed for the client server market  and sale of tape media 
sales of the company s client server tape automation products grew during with the fourth quarter of representing the first quarter in which sales of client server tape products exceeded sales of mainframe tape products 
revenue from timberline r  a track cartridge subsystem  powderhorn r  an automated cartridge system library  and other earlier generation mainframe tape products declined during  compared to  reflecting both lower selling prices and decreases in the number of units sold 
these revenue declines reflect the continued shift in the marketplace from mainframe to client server tape products 
the company believes that the sales of tape products designed for the mainframe market have also been adversely impacted in due to customers delaying testing and purchasing decisions in anticipation of the year tape product revenue increased in  compared to revenue from timberwolf and powderhorn increased in  compared to  but was offset by decreased revenue from timberline and other earlier generation tape products 
the decrease in timberline revenue was primarily the result of an increase in pricing pressure and delays during the second half of in customer purchase decisions associated with the evaluation of the company s tape drive 
the tape drive became generally available and provided initial revenue contribution in december disk products disk product revenue decreased in  compared to  due to a decrease in oem sales of disk storage products designed for the mainframe market to international business machines corporation ibm 
the company does not anticipate any significant sales revenue from ibm in the decline in sales of disk products to ibm were partially offset by an increase in direct sales of the shared virtual array sva 
revenue from the openstorage tm disk products increased in  compared to sales of both the sva and openstorage disk products did not meet the company s expectations in due primarily to issues associated with establishing an effective direct sales channel for these products 
in  the company announced plans to sell sun microsystems  inc s open enterprise disk products under a worldwide oem sales and marketing agreement  however  these new products are currently not available 
in february  the company announced the availability of the sva  the next generation of sva disk products 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to experience decreased sales of disk products as a result of continuing issues associated with sales channels or a lack of market acceptance for its disk products 
disk product revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from the openstorage disk subsystem 
a significant portion of the company s total revenue in was derived from sales of disk products to ibm 
while unit sales of disk storage products for the mainframe market increased in compared to  revenue remained unchanged due to price decreases provided for under the terms of an oem agreement with ibm 
network products network product revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased sales of network products designed for the san market 
the increase in sales of san network products during was offset by decreased revenue from the earlier generation connectivity products 
network product revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to reduced revenue from the earlier generation connectivity products 
the company s storage products revenue may be adversely impacted by its variable sales cycles and by disruptions to its sales organization and customers associated with restructuring activities currently underway  particularly in the first half of future revenue growth in the company s storage products segment is significantly dependent upon the continued demand for its client server tape automation products  successfully replacing oem sales of disk products to ibm with direct sales of disk products  and gaining greater market acceptance of the company s san network products 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these endeavors 
see factors that may affect future results new products  markets and distribution channels  emerging markets  for a discussion of the risks associated with the introduction and manufacture of new products and distribution channels 
storage services storage services includes revenue associated with the maintenance of the company s and third party storage products  as well as integration service revenue associated with new applications  storage consulting and managed storage services 
storage services revenue increased in  compared to  due to growth in storage consulting and integration services 
revenue associated with maintenance services decreased in  compared to  but still represented approximately of total storage services revenue in the decrease in maintenance revenue during was partially due to the shift in the company s customer base from the mainframe to the client server marketplace  as well as the increasing reliance on indirect distribution channels for its products  as some indirect distributors provide service for the products they sell 
storage services revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to an increase in storage products under maintenance contracts and growth in the multi vendor support services area 
in connection with the restructuring activities announced in october  the company anticipates decreased revenue from its storage services segment in as it reduces its investments in  or eliminates  certain lower margin storage consulting  integration and managed storage service offerings 
there can be no assurance that maintenance revenue will not also continue to decline in as the customer base continues to shift to the client server marketplace and the company places increased emphasis on indirect distribution channels 
maintenance revenue may also be adversely affected in future periods to the extent older products currently under maintenance contracts are replaced by newer products with extended warranties 
storage management software storage management software revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from vsm 
vsm is a data storage software solution designed to improve performance  cartridge utilization  and overall storage management 
while revenue from vsm increased during  sales of vsm did not meet the company s expectations 
the company believes sales of vsm during were adversely impacted due to customers delaying purchase decisions in anticipation of the year revenues from vsm during the first half of were also adversely impacted by delays in the introduction and market acceptance of vsm 
revenue from snapshot  which is designed for use with the company s sva disk products  decreased in  compared to  due to a decrease in oem sales to ibm 
storage management software revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from snapshot and vsm 
the increase in snapshot revenue in compared to was primarily due to increased oem sales to ibm 
future revenue growth from storage management software is dependent upon increasing market acceptance for vsm 
because vsm is a complex system  it is difficult to predict the timing and extent that vsm will gain acceptance 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in increasing market acceptance for vsm 
a significant portion of the company s storage management software revenue has been derived from sales of snapshot to ibm 
the company does not anticipate any sales of snapshot to ibm in the company has recently introduced snapshot capabilities for its sva disk products targeted for the client server marketplace 
future revenue growth from snapshot is dependent upon market acceptance of the snapshot software and the related sva disk products  and successfully addressing issues associated with direct sales of its sva products 
gross profit the following table sets forth the gross profit percentages for each segment calculated as gross profit for the segment divided by revenue for the segment 
year ended december total gross profit storage products storage services storage management software gross profit margins decreased to in  compared to in the gross profit margins decreased in all of the company s business segments during gross margins for the company s products have been adversely affected by efforts to shorten sales cycles  increased sales of tape cartridges and third party products which have lower profit margins  a decline in the selling prices for disk products and earlier generation tape products  and unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with excess manufacturing capacity 
gross margins associated with the services segment have decreased principally as a result of increased revenue contribution from lower margin consulting  integration  and managed storage service offerings 
storage service margins have also been adversely impacted by increased pricing pressures associated with the maintenance of storage products in the client server market and increased maintenance costs associated with certain tape products 
gross margins associated with software declined in as the mix of revenue contribution shifted from higher margin snapshot sales to lower margin vsm sales 
gross profit margins increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to the increased sales of higher margin storage management software and improved efficiencies associated with the manufacture of storage products 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by reduced margins associated with storage services 
the decrease in storage service margins was due primarily to increased pricing pressures associated with maintenance of storage products in the client server market and reduced margins associated with the company s consulting services 
the markets for the company s products and services are subject to intense price competition 
the company anticipates that price competition for its products and services will continue to have a significant impact on the company s gross profit margins 
the company s ability to sustain or improve gross margins is significantly dependent upon the timing of discontinuing the storage consulting and integration service offerings  which have generated lower gross margins  the timing of implementing pricing controls and gaining other operational efficiencies in connection with the restructuring activities  and achieving cost improvements associated with the sourcing of production materials 
storage product and storage management software gross margins may be affected in future periods by inventory reserves and writedowns resulting from rapid technological changes or delays in gaining market acceptance for products 
research and product development research and product development expenses increased in  compared to the company received approximately million less research and product development funding from third parties in  compared to excluding the effects of the reduced third party funding  research and product development expense decreased as a percentage of revenue in as compared to  due to the elimination of several lower priority research and product development programs in connection with the restructuring activities 
see restructuring  below  for discussion of the restructuring activities 
research and product development expenditures increased in  compared to the increased investment in new development activities during was partially offset by the receipt of approximately million of research and product development funding from third parties 
selling  general  administrative and other selling  general  administrative and other income and expense sg a increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased selling expenses 
the increase in selling expense reflects an increase in commission and bonus rates  the addition of application sales specialists associated with storage services  an increase in the company s worldwide sales force  and an increase in marketing expenditures 
the company has implemented significant changes to its field organization and the bonus and commission plans for its united states field organization in connection with the restructuring 
these changes are intended to improve sales productivity and reduce selling expenses as a percentage of revenue 
there can be no assurance that these changes will be effective or that the company will not encounter disruptions which adversely affect sales during the implementation of these changes 
sg a increased in  compared to  primarily as a result of spending on internal business and financial information systems  selling expenses associated with the company s storage product sales  and spending on branding initiatives 
the increase was partially offset by reduced accruals for employee bonus and profit sharing payments in  compared to  as the company did not attain financial goals in gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and translation adjustments  net of associated hedging results  are included in sg a and aggregated a net gain of million for  compared to a net loss of million for and a net gain of million in see international operations and market risk management foreign currency exchange risk for further discussion of the foreign exchange risks associated with the company s international operations and the related foreign currency hedging activities 
litigation litigation expense recognized during consists of the following in thousands of dollars odetics  inc settlement  adea erisa settlement  other settlements on october   the company and odetics  inc odetics entered into a settlement agreement regarding two patent infringement suits originally filed against the company by odetics on june   and december   alleging infringement of various claims in us patent no 
 the patent 
the company agreed to pay million to odetics for a fully paid up license to the patent  million of which was paid at the time of the settlement and the remainder to be paid in equal annual installments of million in september and september the company recognized a pre tax expense of million to reflect the present value of the final settlement payments 
on december   at a preliminary fairness hearing  the company and plaintiffs  representing certain former employees of the company  presented the united states district court for the district of colorado the court with a proposed settlement agreement  which would result in the company paying million for the settlement of litigation alleging the company violated the age discrimination in employment act of  as amended adea and the employee retirement income security act of erisa  between the period of april   and december  final approval of this proposed settlement agreement was received from the court on march  the settlement agreement states that it shall not be construed as an admission by the company that it violated any law 
the company funded the settlement with a million payment into an escrow account in december a pre tax expense of million was recognized in connection with the proposed settlement during in january  stuff technology partners ii  a colorado limited partnership stuff  filed suit in boulder county  colorado  district court against the company and certain subsidiaries 
the suit alleged that the company breached a settlement agreement that had resolved earlier litigation between the parties concerning an optical disk drive storage development project entered into in which was unsuccessful and terminated in the suit sought injunctive relief and damages in the amount of billion 
on december   the court granted the company s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint 
stuff appealed the dismissal to the colorado court of appeals 
in march  the court of appeals reversed the district court s judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings 
on july   the district court dismissed with prejudice all of stuff s material claims against the company 
on august   stuff filed a notice of appeal with the colorado court of appeals seeking to overturn the decision of the district court 
the parties are in the process of filing various appellate briefs and the company anticipates that the final briefs will be filed in april no oral argument date has been set 
the company continues to believe that stuff s claims are wholly without merit and intends to defend vigorously any further actions arising from this complaint 
the company is also involved in various other less significant legal actions 
while the company currently believes that the amount of any ultimate potential loss would not be material to the company s financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in the company s inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
restructuring on april   the company announced plans to restructure certain aspects of its business 
the elements of the april restructuring included a voluntary reduction in headcount as well as the elimination of certain lower priority research and product development projects 
the headcount reductions were targeted in the areas of research and product development  administration and manufacturing 
on october   the company s board of directors approved a broad restructuring program intended to return the company to profitability 
key elements of the restructuring plan include an anticipated reduction of approximately  to  positions  with approximately positions eliminated during fiscal year and the majority of the remaining reductions projected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of  a reduction in investment in certain businesses  including consulting and integration services and managed storage services  a recommitment to the company s core strengths of tape automation  virtual storage and storage area networks including related maintenance and professional services  modifications to the sales model for the united states and canada intended to improve productivity and increase account coverage and growth  other organizational and operational changes intended to improve efficiency and competitiveness 
the elements of the october restructuring included an involuntary reduction in headcount  the elimination of a significant number of temporary employee positions  and managing the replacement of terminating employees due to normal attrition 
the headcount reductions were targeted in all areas of the company 
the following table summarizes the reserves in connection with restructuring activities in thousands of dollars employee asset other exit severance writedowns costs total restructuring expense     cash payments    asset writedowns   balances  december    employee severance expense of million was recognized during in connection with the april and october restructurings 
this expense includes of separation charges related to approximately employees who elected voluntary severance in connection with the april restructuring  million of separation charges related to the fixed and determinable severance payments owed to approximately employees who were involuntarily terminated in connection with the october restructuring  and  of employee outplacement costs 
the company also eliminated approximately temporary and contractor positions in connection with the october restructuring for which there was no associated restructuring charge 
substantially all of the million of severance charges incurred  but not paid  as of december   relate to severance payments associated with the october restructuring and are expected to be paid within the next three months 
asset writedowns of million  net of adjustments  were recognized during in connection with the april restructuring 
asset writedowns of million were recognized during the second and third quarters of related to engineering assets that were to be disposed of in connection with discontinued research and development projects 
an adjustment of million was recognized during the fourth quarter of as a reduction of restructuring expense to reflect the redeployment of engineering assets to other research and development projects and the salvage value of other engineering assets which was greater than originally estimated 
other exit costs of million were recognized during principally related to the termination of contractual future purchase obligations associated with discontinuing certain product lines as part of the april restructuring 
the company currently anticipates it will incur restructuring charges of approximately million to million during the first half of associated with the elimination of between and positions 
the majority of these charges are expected to relate to cash payments to employees 
depending on the outcome of the disposition of the company s managed storage services business  additional cash and non cash restructuring charges may be incurred during the company estimates annual savings of approximately million were realized in connection with the april restructuring 
the company anticipates annual savings of approximately million will result from the restructuring activities initiated in october the majority of the restructuring activities are not expected to be complete until the end of the second quarter of because the majority of the restructuring activities are not expected to be completed until the second quarter  the company anticipates it will incur an operating loss during the first quarter of and that the anticipated savings realized for the year will be slightly in excess of million 
based on the restructuring activities completed to date and the currently planned restructuring activities  the company does not anticipate any material incremental operating expenses will be incurred on an on going basis as a result of the restructuring 
restructuring activities which must be successfully completed in order to achieve the anticipated savings include achieving targeted headcount reductions associated with exiting certain consulting and service business activities and the consolidation of internal business units and various engineering  manufacturing  sourcing and logistics activities  restructuring the united states and canada sales and service organization in order to obtain operational efficiencies  modifying the company s bonus and commission plans to better align the sales organization with driving operating profits and implementing operating improvements which emphasize the efficient management of working capital 
in addition to targeted headcount reductions associated with the elimination of permanent positions  the company is also limiting the replacement of terminating employees due to normal attrition and eliminating certain contractors  temporary employees and other non permanent positions 
the number of future involuntary terminations associated with the company s managed storage services business and the timing of these terminations is dependent upon efforts to find strategic alternatives for this business 
the complexity of the company s restructuring activities  the uncertainties associated with the targeted headcount reductions  and the rapidly changing business environment in which the company operates make it difficult to predict the amount and timing of restructuring charges which will be incurred  and the amount and timing of anticipated benefits which will be realized 
the company s sales revenue in the first half of may be adversely effected by disruptions to its sales organization and customers associated with its restructuring activities 
the company has restructured its business in the past in order to re align its business with its products and market strategies  or establish a more cost efficient business structure 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring activities described above will be successful or sufficient to allow the company to generate improved operating results in future periods 
it is possible that additional changes in the company s business or in its industry may necessitate additional restructuring expense in the future 
the necessity for additional restructuring activities may result in expenses that adversely affect reported results of operations in the period the restructuring plan is adopted  and require incremental cash payments 
interest income and expense interest expense increased million in  compared to  due to increased borrowings under the company s credit facilities  as well as an increase in the interest rates the company borrowed under during interest income decreased million in  compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in cash available for investment

income taxes the company s effective tax rate decreased from in to in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that deferred income tax assets be recognized to the extent realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the currently available information  management has determined that the company will more likely than not realize million of deferred income tax assets as of december  the company s valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   relates principally to net deductible temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards associated with the company s foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources working capital the company s cash balance decreased million in due primarily to litigation payments of million and restructuring payments of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of litigation and restructuring  respectively 
excluding the effects of these one time payments  the company s operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash of million generated from operations in the increase in cash generated from operations in  compared to  was primarily the result of progress in the company s efforts to more effectively manage working capital 
cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to property  plant and equipment purchases of million 
cash used in financing activities of million was mainly the result of cash payments of million associated with repurchases of common stock largely offset by cash receipts of million from employee stock plans 
the company s cash and short term investments balances decreased million in due primarily to cash payments of million associated with the company s common stock repurchase programs and net investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
these payments were partially funded by net borrowings under the company s credit facilities of million  cash generated from operating activities of million  and a reduction in short term investments of million 
cash generated from operating activities decreased to million in  compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased cash paid to suppliers and employees 
the increased cash paid to suppliers and employees was primarily a result of cash paid for additional inventory on hand as of december   for new product ramp up  and cash payments in to reduce accrued liabilities outstanding as of december  the accrued liabilities as of december   were higher than as of december   primarily as a result of employee bonus and profit sharing  and restructuring accruals

the terms of the primary revolver were amended in january to be secured by the company s us accounts receivable and us inventory 
the interest rates under the primary revolver depend upon the repayment period of the advance selected and the company s total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio

the supplemental revolver contains certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on the company s common stock 
the company has a financing agreement with a bank that provides for the sale of promissory notes in the principal amount of up to million at any one time 
this financing agreement was amended in january to provide for the sale of promissory notes in the principal amount of up to million at any one time 
the agreement  which expires in january  provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as of december   the company had promissory notes of million outstanding under this financing agreement and had committed to borrowings between january and january in the cumulative principal amount of approximately million 
the notes must be repaid only to the extent of future revenue 
obligations under the agreement are not cancelable by the company or the bank 
gains and losses associated with changes in the underlying foreign currencies are deferred during the commitment period and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment at the time the bank purchases the promissory notes 
the promissory notes  together with accrued interest  are payable in us dollars within days from the date of issuance 
the weighted average interest rate associated with the promissory notes outstanding as of december   was 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants and  under certain circumstances  may be required to maintain a collateral account  including cash and qualifying investments  in an amount up to the outstanding balance of the promissory notes 
the company believes it has adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
over the longer term  the company may choose to fund these activities through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that any additional long term financing  if required  can be completed on terms acceptable to the company 
total debt to total capitalization the company s total debt to capitalization ratio increased from as of december   to as of december   primarily due to a net increase in borrowings of million under the company s credit facilities

international operations during   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenue was generated by its international operations 
the company also sells products and software through domestic indirect distribution channels that have end user customers located outside the united states 
the company expects that it will continue to generate a significant portion of its revenue from international operations in the future 
the majority of the company s international operations involve transactions denominated in the local currencies of countries within western europe  principally germany  france and the united kingdom  japan  canada and australia 
an increase in the exchange value of the united states dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by the company s international operations 
as a result  the company s operating and financial results can be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company employs a foreign currency hedging program 
see market risk management foreign currency exchange risk  below 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from global and localized economic  business and political conditions 
the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states  including changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  tariffs  quotas  difficulty in obtaining export licenses  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors outside the company s control 
there can be no assurances these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial results in the future 
market risk management foreign currency exchange risk the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments relates primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company seeks opportunities to reduce exposures through financing activities 
foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are also used to reduce foreign currency exposures 
all foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are authorized and executed pursuant to the company s policies 
foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts that are designated as and qualify as hedging transactions are subject to hedge accounting treatment 
the company does not hold or issue derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s financial instruments and off balance sheet risks 
the company has a financing agreement with a bank that provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
gains and losses associated with changes in the underlying foreign currencies are deferred during the commitment period and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment at the time the bank purchases the promissory notes 
see liquidity and capital resources available financing lines for a description of the financing agreement 
the company periodically utilizes foreign currency options  generally with maturities of less than one year  to hedge a portion of its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated revenue from its international operations 
gains and losses associated with the options are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the underlying revenue transactions 
to the extent an option is terminated or ceases to be effective as a hedge  any gains and losses as of that date are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the underlying revenue transaction 
the company also utilizes forward exchange contracts  generally with maturities of less than two months  to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies and anticipated revenue from its international operations 
the carrying amounts of these forward exchange contracts equal their fair values as the contracts are adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities are recognized as incurred within sg a on the consolidated statement of operations as adjustments to the foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of net monetary assets 
gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge anticipated revenue are recognized as incurred as adjustments to revenue 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates applied to the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments held as of december   and as of december   would result in a hypothetical loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the hypothetical loss for is primarily due to a decrease in outstanding foreign currency options 
these hypothetical losses do not take into consideration the company s underlying international operations 
the company anticipates that any hypothetical loss associated with the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments would be offset by gains associated with its underlying international operations 
the company had outstanding borrowings under its primary revolver as of december  the interest rate on these borrowings is dependent on the libor which is sensitive to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the libor applied to the borrowings would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position in factors that may affect future results new products  services and software  emerging markets the company s results of operations and competitive strength depend upon its ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market innovative new products  services  and software 
short product life cycles are inherent in the high technology market 
the company must devote significant resources to research and product development projects and effectively manage the risks inherent in new product transitions 
developing new technology  products  services and software is complex and involves uncertainties 
delays in product development  manufacturing  or in customer evaluation and purchasing decisions may make product transitions difficult 
the manufacture of new products involves integrating complex designs and processes  collaborating with sole source suppliers for key components  and increasing manufacturing capacities to accommodate demand 
a design flaw  the failure to obtain sufficient quantities of key components  or manufacturing constraints could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results 
the company has experienced product development delays in the past that adversely affected the company s financial results and competitive position 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to manage successfully the development and introduction of new products  services  and software in the future 
the company s future financial results are significantly dependent upon successfully competing in the rapidly growing emerging client server and sans markets and replacing its earlier generation products in the mainframe environment with new technology 
the company currently is making significant investments in developing new products and software for these markets  particularly in products directed towards the internet and e commerce businesses 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these activities 
the sans market is a new market and is rapidly evolving 
the company s operating and financial results may be adversely impacted in the event the sans market develops slower than expected or the company s products fail to gain acceptance in this market 
the company s traditional maintenance revenue base may be adversely impacted as a result of the shift from mainframe to the client server marketplace 
competition the markets for the company s products  software and services are intensely competitive and are subject to continuous  rapid technological change  frequent product performance improvements  short product life cycles  and aggressive pricing 
the company believes that its ability to remain competitive involves factors such as price and cost of the company s and its competitors product offerings  the timing and success of new products and offerings  new product introductions by competitors  and the ability to establish more effective distribution channels 
this competitive environment gives rise to aggressive pricing strategies and puts pressure on gross profit margins 
the company s competitors include  among others  compaq computer corporation  emc corporation  hewlett packard company  hitachi ltd  ibm  quantum corporation  and sun microsystems  inc a number of the company s competitors have significantly greater name recognition and financial resources than the company 
in the highly competitive client server market  a number of the company s competitors are able to offer customers a bundled server and storage product  which may provide them with a competitive advantage 
the company expects to address these competitive issues  in part  through its san strategy 
from time to time  two or more of the company s competitors may form business alliances that compete with the company 
for example  in the first quarter of  ibm and emc corporation announced that they have entered into a strategic business and technology alliance 
in addition  during the third quarter of  emc corporation acquired data general  the supplier of the company s openstorage disk products 
the alliance of two of the company s major competitors could adversely affect the company s ability to compete 
a number of the company s competitors have formed alliances with the stated objective of developing interoperable san solutions 
in the storage management software market  the company competes with vendors with which it has established relationships  including legato systems  inc and veritas software corporation 
the company also anticipates that it will continue to establish distribution alliances with other equipment manufacturers  software vendors and service providers to address competitive factors 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to compete successfully against other companies in these markets 
significant personnel changes during  the company has experienced significant changes in its management team  including the hiring  resignation and retirement of members of its executive sales and marketing management 
the company announced in february that david e 
weiss  the company s chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer  would resign from the company once the board of directors located a successor 
the search for a successor to mr 
weiss is currently underway and the company is unable to predict when a successor will be elected 
in february  the company also announced significant changes to its operating management  including the planned departure of victor perez  the company s chief operating officer  at the end of the first quarter of further  the company may experience a delay between the time the management team is formed and the time the team becomes fully productive 
the company has also experienced changes in the remainder of its employee base during and early as a result of the voluntary and involuntary severance programs implemented in connection with its restructuring activities  as well as increased levels of employee attrition 
the future success of the company depends in large part on its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
the company faces significant competition for individuals with the skills required to deliver the products and services offered to its customers 
an inability to successfully deliver products and services required by its customers  or an inability to implement the restructuring activities while the company completes the significant personnel changes currently underway  would have an adverse effect on future operating results 
changes in sales model for the united states and canada the company historically has emphasized the use of its direct sales force in the united states and canada  complemented by indirect distribution channels  such as oems  value added resellers and value added distributors 
in connection with its current restructuring activities  the company is implementing changes to its sales model for the united states and canada that the company expects will improve market penetration  increase sales profitability  reduce marketing expense  and expand the use of the indirect sales channel 
this new sales model is intended to provide better coverage for new and existing end user customers  as well as enhancing reseller  distributor and oem partnerships 
the company is currently reorganizing its field sales organization with the objective of better serving fortune customers with enterprise level product and service requirements 
a new sales organization is also being formed to address the needs of small and medium sized customers with particular emphasis on internet and e commerce businesses 
there is no assurance that the company will not encounter short term disruptions to its sales as it implements this new sales model or that the new emphasis on indirect sales channels will result in increased sales or profitability over the long term 
the company s operating and financial results may be adversely affected by reduced margins on sales typically experienced in indirect sales channels 
decline in mainframe revenue  variable sales cycle the company historically has generated a significant portion of its revenue and operating profits from the mainframe market 
the company s revenue from the mainframe market declined during  primarily due to the transition of customers purchase patterns to the client server environment  the decline in disk product and software sales to ibm  and significant price competition 
in addition  the company believes its revenue has been adversely impacted in as some customers have delayed testing and purchasing decisions in anticipation of the year  particularly with respect to tape products and software targeted for the mainframe market 
because of the multiple dynamics within the mainframe marketplace  it is difficult to predict future demand for the company s mainframe products 
the demand for the company s products  particularly in the mainframe market  will be adversely affected to the extent these patterns continue 
many of the company s customers undertake significant procedures relating to the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of the company s products  software and services 
this evaluation process results in a variable sales cycle  and makes it difficult to predict if or when revenue will be earned 
ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights the company relies heavily upon its ability to develop new intellectual property rights that do not infringe upon the rights of others in order to remain competitive and develop and manufacture products that are competitive in terms of technology and cost 
there is no assurance that the company will continue to be able to develop such new intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of united states patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect its intellectual property rights 
with respect to certain of the company s international operations  the company does file patent applications with foreign government 
however  many foreign countries do not have as well developed laws as the united states in protecting intellectual property 
the company enters into confidentiality agreements relating to its intellectual property with its employees and consultants 
in addition  the company includes confidentiality provisions in license and non exclusive sales agreements with its indirect distributors and its customers 
despite all of the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use the company s intellectual property 
monitoring the unauthorized use of the company s intellectual property rights is difficult  particularly in foreign countries 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to protect its intellectual property rights  particularly in foreign countries 
sole source suppliers the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products and believes that  in most cases  there are a number of alternative  competent vendors for most of those parts and components 
many non standard parts are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  however  there are other vendors who could produce these in satisfactory quantities after a period of pre qualification and product ramping 
certain key components and products are purchased from single source suppliers that the company believes are currently the only manufacturers of the particular components that meet the company s qualification requirements and other specifications or for which alternative sources of supply are not readily available 
imation corporation is a single source supplier for the tape cartridges and the company is dependent on imation to economically produce large volumes of high quality tape cartridges for the product at a price acceptable to the company and its customers 
sumitomo is a single source supplier for a key component used in certain tape products 
ibm is a single source supplier for the disk drives used in the company s sva disk product 
certain suppliers have experienced occasional technical  financial or other problems in the past that have delayed deliveries  but without significant effect on the company 
an unanticipated failure of any sole source supplier to meet the company s requirements for an extended period  or the inability to secure comparable components in a timely manner  could result in a shortage of key components  longer lead times  and reduced control over production and delivery schedules 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on revenue and operating results 
in the event a sole source supplier was unable or unwilling to continue to supply components  the company would have to identify and qualify other acceptable suppliers 
this process could take an extended period  and no assurance can be given that any additional source would become available or would be able to satisfy production requirements on a timely basis or at a price acceptable to the company 
the company is dependent upon a sole sub contractor  herald datanetics ltd 
hdl  to manufacture a key component used in certain tape products 
hdl is located in the people s republic of china prc 
to date  the company has not experienced any material problems with hdl  however  hdl is subject to additional risks beyond those associated with other sole suppliers  including the lack of a well established court system or acceptance of the rule of law in the prc  the degree to which the prc permits economic reform policies to continue  the political relationship between the prc and the united states and broader political and economic factors  such as whether the prc is admitted to the world trade organization 
manufacturing a significant portion of the company s products are manufactured in facilities located in puerto rico 
the company s ability to manufacture product may be impacted by weather related risks beyond the control of the company 
if the puerto rico manufacturing facility were impacted by such an event  the company may not have an alternative source to meet the demand for its products without substantial delays and disruption to its operations 
the company carries interruption insurance to mitigate some of the risk 
there is no assurance that the company could obtain sufficient alternate manufacturing sources or repair the facilities in a timely manner to satisfy the demand for its products 
failure to fulfill manufacture demands could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results in the future 
information systems and business process transitions the company replaced many of its internal information systems outside the united states during with new  integrated information systems 
the company also introduced significant new business processes in conjunction with these new systems  particularly within its european operations 
the implementation of these information systems and business processes has been complex and has affected numerous operational  transactional  financial  and reporting processes 
the establishment of processes and training associated with these information systems are continuing and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company must successfully manage the business process changes and employee training programs 
there can be no assurance that the transition to the new information systems and business processes will not cause delays or interruptions in the company s business 
failure to successfully manage the transition could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results in the future 
volatility of stock price earnings fluctuations the company s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in trading price 
the company s stock price may be impacted if the company s revenue or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community 
the company s stock price may also be affected by broad economic and market trends  which are unrelated to the company s performance 
the company s financial and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of reasons 
in the past  the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern  which reflects the tendency of customers to make their purchase decisions at the end of a calendar year 
during any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large portion of the total product sales is recognized in the last weeks and days of the quarter 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently difficult 
because the company plans its operating expenses on expected revenue  a shortfall in revenue may cause earnings to be below expectations in that period 
a number of factors may cause revenue to fall below expectations  such as product and technology transitions announced by the company or its competitors  delays in the availability of new products  changes in the purchasing patterns of the company s customers and distribution partners  the timing of customers acceptance of products  rapid price erosion  or adverse global economic conditions 
the mix of sales among the company s business segments and sales concentration in particular geographic regions may carry different gross profit margins and may cause the company s operating margins to fluctuate and impact earnings 
risks associated with the year the company s product lines include information storage products and software which collect  move  store  share  and protect data 
in order to process data properly  the company s products must successfully manage and manipulate data that includes both th and st century dates year ready 
the company is not currently aware of any significant problems among its customers as a result of any failure of the company s products to be year ready 
in addition  the company did not experience any serious problems among the various computer systems used by the company and  to the best of the company s knowledge  none of its significant suppliers experienced any serious problems among the various computer systems used by such suppliers 
the company generally believes that it is not legally responsible for costs incurred by its customers to achieve their year readiness 
since the year complications are not fully known and potential liability issues are uncertain  the effect of the year on the company s warranty costs  product liability costs  potential litigation expenses  and financial results are not known at this time  but could be material in any given quarter 
the costs incurred through december   directly related to the company s remediation activities were approximately million and no future costs related to the remediation activities are expected
