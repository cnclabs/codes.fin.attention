background and overview as of june   we operated colleges  with more than  students  in states 
during the fiscal year ended june   our company had net revenues of million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition  enrollment fees and bookstore sales  and are presented as net revenues after deducting refunds 
net revenues increased to million in from million in the increase is largely the result of a increase in the average student population and a increase in the average tuition rate per student during the period 
tuition revenues  which represented of fiscal total net revenues  fluctuate with the aggregate enrolled student population and the average program or credit hour charge 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student starts occur on a monthly basis in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level  such as diploma  or associate s  bachelor s or masters degree  and the specific curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues  on a cash basis  was derived from federal student financial aid programs 
we categorize our expenses as educational services  general and administrative  and marketing and advertising 
educational services expense is primarily comprised of those costs incurred to deliver and administer the education programs at the colleges  including faculty and college administration compensation  education materials and supplies  college facility rent and other occupancy costs  bad debt expense  depreciation and amortization of college property  equipment and goodwill  and default management and financial aid processing costs 
general and administrative expense consists principally of those costs incurred at the corporate and regional level in support of college operations  except for marketing and advertising related costs 
included in general and administrative costs are company executive management  corporate staff and regional operations management compensation  rent and other occupancy costs for corporate headquarters  depreciation and amortization of corporate property  equipment and intangibles  and other expenses incurred at corporate headquarters 
marketing and advertising expense includes compensation for college admissions staff  regional admissions directors  corporate marketing and advertising executive management  and staff and all advertising and production costs 
acquisitions since our inception  we have completed the following acquisitions  each of which was accounted for as an asset purchase using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of their operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective dates of acquisition on june   we acquired five colleges from national education corporation 
as part of the same transaction  we subsequently acquired from national education corporation a second group of five colleges on september  and an additional six colleges on december  the adjusted purchase price for all colleges was approximately million in cash 
on july   we acquired one college from repose  inc  for a purchase price of  in cash 
on august   we acquired one college from concorde career colleges  inc  for a purchase price of  in cash 
on october   we acquired colleges from phillips colleges  inc  for an adjusted purchase price of approximately million in cash

results of operations comparisons of results of operations between fiscal year ended june  and fiscal years ended june  and are difficult due to the acquisitions of five campuses in fiscal  the opening of two branch campuses in fiscal and the opening of two additional branch campuses in fiscal the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated

at june   the total student population was  compared with  at june  same school student population increased as of june  in connection with our acquisition of colleges from phillips colleges  inc in fiscal  we honored certain fixed price commitments to students already in school grandfathered students when we acquired those colleges 
as a result  over the last several years  including fiscal  our average tuition rate per student has increased more dramatically than the actual tuition price increases at our schools 
this is as a result of the changing mix of new to grandfathered students  as the latter students have graduated or discontinued their education 
with virtually all grandfathered students having now graduated or discontinued their education  we expect year over year increases in the average tuition rate per student to more closely track the actual tuition price increases implemented

seasonality our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally in its total student population 
student population varies as a result of new student enrollments and student attrition 
historically  our colleges have had lower student populations in the first fiscal quarter than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new school openings  new program introductions and increased high school enrollments 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

in june  we sold one of our colorado facilities and subsequently leased the facility back at rents which approximate fair market rents
