item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
all data in the tables are in thousands  except for percentages and per share data 
the company s principal line of business is an integrated systems solution provider of cleanrooms and cleanroom component systems for the semiconductor industry 
in recent years  the company has typically had one to three significant customers  each of whom accounted for approximately or more of the company s annual revenues  these customers do not necessarily remain significant in subsequent years 
the semiconductor industry has been historically cyclical in nature and continues to be adversely affected by the industry downturn that began in the latter part of capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers has always closely followed chip sales 
as chip sales increased from around billion per year in the late s to a peak of billion in  capital spending on equipment and facilities by the chip manufacturers surged to billion from about billion during the same period of time 
as chip sales have declined over the past three years to about billion in  capital spending on new equipment and facilities plunged to less than billion in various industry analysts have reported that in chip sales increased by which indicates that the recent downturn may be ending 
in addition  analysts predict that chip sales for may increase by an additional to percent 
the company s recovery cycle in relation to the award of cleanroom projects lags behind the semiconductor manufacturers recovery in relation to chip sales 
the company s operating results have been severely impacted by the reduced capital spending of the semiconductor industry during the past three years 
while the industry has shown signs of recovery from time to time over the past three years  it has been consistently disappointed by continued declines 
management believes the downturn is nearing its end and the industry is on the road to recovery 
the timing or likelihood or any such recovery that will take place is still subject to significant uncertainty 
the downturn in generally resulted in fewer contracts available to bid  a significant increase in price competition on contracts that were awarded  and reduced margins on such contracts 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced growth in new contract awards resulting in an increase in the company s backlog from million at december  to million at december  additionally  during the first quarter of  the company has experienced a significant increase in contract bidding and contract awards at significantly higher gross margins than at any time during the three year industry downturn 
although there is uncertainty regarding the condition and prospects of a full recovery in the semiconductor industry  management continues to believe that changes taking place in the industry should result in expanded semiconductor industry capital expenditures 
delays in the ramp up of mm technology have delayed the expected construction of a whole series of mm fabs worldwide  although during the fourth quarter of construction of some of these delayed fabs was initiated 
in response to the current downturn  management has continued to take steps to reduce the company s cost structure including an approximate cut in wages in as compared to previously  in  the company reduced its work force by more than fifty percent 
during  management will closely monitor the company s cost structure and take appropriate actions as considered necessary  but will continue to develop state of the art cleanroom technology  provide world class support to the company s customers  and continue its diversification strategy 
in response to reduced revenue generated by the sale of cleanrooms  the company has recently undertaken several initiatives to expand its revenue base beyond the semiconductor industry and to reduce its reliance on this historically cyclical business 
the company has developed an air entrance system used by large national retail chains in their new superstores 
air entrances are used in lieu of conventional swinging and sliding doors to help the store maintain comfort in the front of the store  reduce liability and increase and optimize the traffic flow in and out of the store 
the company s air entrance system was developed by applying its advanced cleanroom air movement and filtration technology resulting in a technically superior air entrance system 
this product also shows great promise of providing increased gross profit over the next two years 
additionally  the company has entered into several contract manufacturing agreements whereby the company manufactures products owned and marketed by third parties 
during the first quarter of  the company announced its entrance into the transportation industry where it started producing sleeper cabs for heavy duty trucks 
by applying similar wall panel systems technology used in cleanrooms the company produces a stronger  more durable  and lighter weight product than traditional sleeper cabs 
this technology may eventually be applied to other products in the transportation industry 
it is the company s objective to develop and maintain of its revenues from sources outside of the semiconductor industry by applying its product and engineering expertise in custom metal fabrication  airflow systems and panel production to similar type products used in other industries 
the company s revenue and operating results fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending on such factors as the timing of customer orders  the timing of revenue and cost recognition  variations in contract mix  changes in customer buying patterns  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  utilization of capacity  manufacturing productivity and efficiency  availability of key components and trends in the economies of the geographical regions in which the company operates 
the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for its long term cleanroom contracts 
the company recognizes revenue in proportion to the costs incurred to date in relation to the total anticipated costs 
revenue recognized may not be the same as progress billings to the customer 
underbillings are reflected in an asset account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts in progress  and overbillings are reflected in a liability account billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on contracts in progress 
non cleanroom revenue is generally recognized when the products are shipped to the customer 
the company generates revenue in two geographic regions  north america and europe 
although risk of fluctuations in currency value does not affect such dollar denominated contracts  changes in the relative value of the dollar could make the company less competitive in various markets 
contracts to be performed in europe may be denominated in local currency  and the company bears the risk of changes in the relative value of the dollar and the local currencies 
devaluation of world currencies against the us dollar has created extreme price competitiveness from korean  japanese  and german manufacturers and integrators of systems 
the company has in the past and may in the future attempt to hedge against currency fluctuations on contracts denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that such hedging will fully insulate the company from fluctuations or will not expose the company to additional risks of loss 
the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
results of operations revenue from operations change change cleanrooms and related products 
   other products   total revenue    revenue from cleanrooms and related products decreased in to million from million in the decrease was due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry s capital expenditures for new fab facilities as more fully discussed above 
during  cleanroom contract revenue decreased by to million from million in this decrease is primarily related to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as discussed above 
revenue from other products increased to million in from million in during  revenue from other products was million as compared to in the increase is due to the start up and continuation of new lines of business  including the company s line of sleeper cabs  contract manufacturing  and other product sales that were non existent in north america cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue  north america revenue increased to in compared to in the decrease in north america contract revenue is primarily related to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry as more fully discussed above 
revenue from other products of million was primarily attributable to sales of sleeper cabs and various contract manufactured products sold only in north america in cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  north america revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease is the result of fewer contracts received in north america due to the decline in capital spending by the semiconductor industry 
asia pacific rim cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue asia pacific revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease in revenue and percentage was directly related to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry in the asia pacific rim and the company s decision to pull out of this region 
the company has transferred ownership of its asia branch to a former employee and does not intend to pursue contracts for cleanroom projects in asia until january cleanroom revenue for december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue  asia pacific revenue increased to in compared to in the increase in revenue and percentage was primarily due to the award of a significant project in china 
the contract was subsequently placed on indefinite suspension due to the uncertainty of the asian market 
europe cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue  european revenue increased to in compared to in although the worldwide downturn in the semiconductor industry continued in  it does not appear to have affected the european segment as dramatically as the asian and north american markets 
cleanroom revenue for increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue  europe revenue increased to in compared to in while the semiconductor industry has experienced a worldwide downturn  it did not appear to have affected the european segment as dramatically as the asian and north american markets 
additionally  the company was able to win contracts in new countries that it had not contracted business in previously 
gross profit change change gross profit    percentage of revenues gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  gross profit increased as a percentage of revenue to for compared to for the company believes the decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of the semiconductor industry downturn  which generally resulted in fewer contracts available to bid  a significant increase in price competition on contracts that were awarded  and reduced margins on such contracts 
the downturn has resulted in fewer contracts awarded and those that were awarded were done so after a highly competitive bidding process placing significant downward pressure on pricing and thus resulting in lower margins 
gross profit for decreased by to million from million in  and decreased as a percentage of contract revenue to in from in the decrease in gross profit was the direct result of the substantial reductions in contracts awarded from to as the semiconductor industry entered its second year of its downturn 
as the downturn gained momentum throughout  the company had fewer contracts to which it could allocate its fixed manufacturing overhead costs the company had put in place in prior years as a result of anticipated contract awards 
selling  general and administrative expenses change change selling  general and administrative expenses    percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million  from million  and increased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared with was primarily the result of a difference in the calculation of the manufacturing overhead expense allocation to direct cost of goods sold 
the company allocates a portion of its overhead costs associated with the direct manufacture of its products to costs of goods sold 
while combined selling  general and administrative expenses for payroll and other overhead expenses decreased by approximately million from to  the overhead allocation costs associated with the direct manufacture of its products to costs of goods sold and then reclassified as direct costs was approximately million more in than selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased to million  or of contract revenue  from million  or of revenue  in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was the result of an aggressive cost reduction program as well as significant headcount reductions completed during the fourth quarter of during which approximately employees were laid off  thus reducing payroll and related expenses 
research and development change change research and development expense percentage of revenues research and development expense decreased slightly in actual dollars spent from to management believes that the company will increase its research and development expenses during  both in actual dollars spent and as a percentage of revenue in order to develop innovative products associated with cleanrooms and with the company s efforts to diversify its products 
also  research and development expenses will be increased in the continued effort to modify existing products to be less expensive to produce and easier to install 
research and development expense increased slightly from to this increase was the result of more research and development projects associated with the company s diversification efforts 
depreciation and amortization change change depreciation and amortization expense percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense during decreased by to  or of revenue  from  or of revenues  in this decrease was the result of some leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software becoming fully depreciated in depreciation and amortization expense in increased by to  or of revenues  from  or of revenues  in this increase was the result of a full year depreciation expense on leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software purchased during other income expense  net change change other income expense percentage of revenues other income expense increased in to  from  in this modest increase was largely due to an increase in interest expense in resulting from an increase in the average line of credit rate on the company s revolving line of credit over restructuring charges change change restructuring charges  percentage of revenues restructuring charges were largely due to the disposition of the company s asia pacific office  and the write down of inventory associated with the decision to divest itself of the company s cleanroom component manufacturing division 
the company has previously announced its plans to pursue a foundry strategy for the manufacture of cleanroom components by selling its cleanroom component manufacturing business unit 
it continues to manufacture component systems on a limited basis until a buyer or joint venture partner can be identified 
the company is in discussion with several interested parties 
income taxes benefit change change income taxes benefit    percentage of revenues the changes in the effective tax rates for all periods relate primarily to the amount of deferred tax assets recorded and the amount of offsetting valuation allowances provided against such assets 
see note j of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the increase from to was partially the result of tax benefits the company was able to utilize from its foreign sales corporation 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  this included cash and cash equivalents of  and million at december  and respectively 
receivables  including retentions  see note d of notes to financial statements decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease was the result of lower revenues from fewer contracts during compared to day s sales outstanding the ratio between receivables  excluding retention  and average daily revenue taken over the year decreased to days at december   from days at december the company s operations used million of cash during  compared to using million of cash in during  the company experienced a decrease in receivables of million as a result of the decline in revenues  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately of million as a result of more restrictive covenants associated with the company s revolving line of credit  an increase in inventories of million  and a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts in progress of million 
the company maintained a revolving line of credit with a domestic bank for the lesser of million or the available borrowing base for the period ended december  and million for the period ended december  the interest rate is computed at the bank s prime rate plus percent at december  and requires monthly payments of interest 
subsequent to year end the bank lowered its interest rate computation to the bank s prime rate plus  but has informed the company that it will restore the rate to prime plus again as of may  the line of credit expired june  and was extended to august  the line of credit is collateralized by certain domestic receivables and inventories 
the line of credit agreement contains restrictive covenants imposing limitations on payments of cash dividends  purchases or redemptions of capital stock  indebtedness and other matters 
at times during and at december   the company was out of compliance on certain indebtedness covenants 
subsequent to year end  the company signed an extension of the line of credit through august  which included a waiver for the non compliance with the covenants as of december  the company is currently reviewing several financing alternatives 
during  the company used  for the purchase of property and equipment and realized  from the sale of property and equipment 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures in for routine additions and replacements of property  and equipment will be less than  these purchases will be financed through long term debt or capital leases 
management believes that existing cash balances  borrowings available under the line of credit  cash generated from operations  and proceeds from a scheduled million private equity placement will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements through december  however  in the event the company experiences adverse operating performance  above anticipated capital expenditure requirements  or is unable to complete the private equity placement or to renew its existing line of credit  additional financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms if at all 
year issues in and the company developed a comprehensive plan to address year issues 
the areas of focus were as follows i the company s information technology systems  ii the company s non information technology systems ie machinery  equipment and devices which utilize built in or embedded technology  and iii third party suppliers and customers 
during the first quarter of the company did not suffer any negative effects from the advent of the year regarding the company s information technology system  non information technology systems or third party suppliers and customers 
no assurance can be given that the company will not be materially adversely affected by future year issues 
impact of future accounting pronouncements none 
factors affecting future results the company s operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could result in actual operating results differing materially from anticipated operating results and past operating results and trends 
these risks and uncertainties include pricing pressures  cancellations of existing contracts  timing of significant customer orders  increased competition  and changes in semiconductor and cleanroom technology 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse change in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for the company  these exposures are primarily related to the sale of product to foreign customers and changes in interest rates 
the company does not have any derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily in relation to its revolving credit line debt with a bank 
the fair value of the company s total revolving credit line debt at december  was million 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at december  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to a market rate  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
the company s financial position is not materially affected by fluctuations in currencies against the us dollar  since assets held outside the united states are negligible 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels of local currency prices  as the preponderance of its foreign sales occur over short periods of time or are denominated in us dollars
