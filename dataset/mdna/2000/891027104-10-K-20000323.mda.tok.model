results of operations the following is a discussion of torchmark s operations for the three years ended december  in the analysis and comparison of torchmark s operating results with and  two divestitures that occurred in should be taken into account a the divestiture of waddell reed b the sale of family service divestiture of waddell reed 
in march   waddell reed  torchmark s asset management subsidiary  completed an initial public offering of approximately million shares of its common stock 
the offering represented approximately of waddell reed s shares 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after underwriters fees and expenses 
waddell reed used million of the proceeds to repay existing notes owed to torchmark and other torchmark subsidiaries and retained the remaining million 
torchmark s million proceeds from the note repayments were invested or used to pay down debt 
see the discussion on investments on page  liquidity on page  and capital resources on page of this report 
the initial public offering resulted in a million gain which was added to torchmark s additional paid in capital 
torchmark retained the remaining of the waddell reed stock 
on november   torchmark distributed its remaining investment in waddell reed through a tax free spin off to torchmark shareholders 
each torchmark shareholder of record on october  received a total of 
waddell reed shares per torchmark share 
after the spin off  torchmark retained no further ownership interest in waddell reed 
as a result of the transaction  torchmark incurred million in expenses related to the spin off  the majority of which was million of corporate federal income tax resulting from the distribution of a portion of the policyholder surplus account of a torchmark life subsidiary 
torchmark has accounted for the spin off of waddell reed as a disposal of a segment 
accordingly  torchmark s financial statements for and all prior periods were modified to present the net assets and operating results of waddell reed as discontinued operations of the disposed segment 
the million expense of the spin off is included in discontinued operations under the caption loss on disposal 
the distribution of the waddell reed shares resulted in a reduction in torchmark s shareholders equity in the approximate amount of million  consisting of the equity in waddell reed  net of the minority interest 
torchmark s share of waddell reed s earnings for was million after reduction for the minority interest during the period subsequent to the initial public offering but before the spin off 
this compares with million for  when torchmark owned of waddell reed for the entire period 
sale of family service

through may   family service contributed million in revenues and million in pretax income 
invested assets were million and total assets were million at the date of the sale 
summary of operating results 
torchmark s management computes a classification of income called net operating income 
net operating income is the measure of income torchmark s management focuses on to evaluate the performance of the operations of the company 
it differs from net income as reported in the financial statements in that it excludes unusual and nonrecurring income or loss items which distort operating trends 
it also excludes discontinued operations 
the following items were excluded from net income as reported in torchmark s financial statements in order to compute net operating income realized investment gains and losses and the related adjustment to deferred acquisition costs  net of tax  net income or loss from the discontinued operations of waddell reed  including the million nonrecurring expenses of the spin off  torchmark s pro rata share of the income or losses related to vesta  the nonrecurring loss from the redemption by torchmark of its debt in the second quarter of in the amount of million net of tax  a one time gain on the sale of equipment included in other income in the after tax amount of million  and the effect of a change in accounting principle which modified the accounting for an interest rate swap instrument  increasing net income in the after tax amount of million 
additionally  in  torchmark entered into a life insurance marketing arrangement with a third party  discussed more fully under the caption life insurance on page of this report 
this agreement contained certain cash guarantees to the third party which would not be recoverable by torchmark based on test marketing results 
accordingly  torchmark recorded a nonrecurring after tax operating charge of million  or 
per diluted share in because this was an unusual one time charge  net operating income has been presented before the charge for comparability 
a reconciliation of net operating income to net income on a per diluted share basis is as follows reconciliation of per share net operating income to reported net income net operating income before nonrecurring charge nonrecurring charge

realized losses in also included a million after tax loss from the reduction in value of torchmark s interest rate swap relating to its mips  as discussed under the caption capital resources on page of this report 
realized investment losses in  which were million net of tax  included a million after tax loss from the sale of family service  a million after tax loss on the writedown of torchmark s vesta holdings  and a million after tax loss from the sale of a portion of the vesta holdings 
losses in  in the after tax amount of million  were primarily a result of intentional sales of fixed maturity investments at a loss to offset current and prior year taxable gains 
the vesta transactions are discussed on page and the redemption of torchmark debt is discussed under the caption capital resources on page of this report 
the change in accounting principle is discussed in note change in accounting principle to the consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
torchmark reports earnings per share data as basic and diluted 
basic earnings per share are based on average shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of torchmark s employee stock options for which the exercise price was lower than the market price during the year and their impact on shares outstanding 
diluted earnings per share differ from basic earnings per share in that they are influenced by changes in the market price of torchmark stock and the number of options as well as the number of shares outstanding 
unless otherwise indicated  all references to per share data in this report are on the basis of diluted shares 
a comparison of torchmark s basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows earnings and earnings per share dollar amounts in thousands  except for per share data for the year ended december  net operating income before nonrecurring charge amount    per share basic diluted net operating income amount    per share basic diluted net income amount    per share basic diluted torchmark s revenues were billion in  an increase of over revenues of billion

the components of torchmark s revenues and operations are described in more detail in the discussion of insurance and investment segments found on pages through of this report 
the following table is a summary of torchmark s continuing net operating income 
insurance underwriting income is defined by torchmark management as premium income less net policy obligations  commissions  acquisition expenses  and insurance administrative expenses plus other income

torchmark s core operations are segmented into insurance underwriting operations and investment operations 
insurance underwriting activities are further segmented into life insurance  health insurance  and annuity product groups 
a detailed discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is torchmark s largest segment  with life premium representing of total premium and with life underwriting income before other income  administrative expense  and nonrecurring charge  representing of the total 
life insurance products provide higher underwriting margins and a larger asset base resulting from higher reserve levels 
a larger asset base provides torchmark the opportunity to increase investment income 
family service was sold on june  comparisons of through in the following discussions of torchmark s life insurance operations exclude family service 
life insurance premium rose in to billion from million in life premium increased in sales of life insurance  in terms of annualized premium  were million in  increasing over sales of million 
this compares with growth in sales over annualized life premium in force was billion at december   compared with billion at year end  an increase of 
annualized premium in force grew in from billion at year end annualized premium in force and issued data includes amounts collected on certain interest sensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but excludes single premium income and policy account charges 
life insurance products are marketed through a variety of distribution channels 
the following table presents life insurance premium by distribution method during each of the three years ended december  life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total liberty national exclusive agency    direct response    american income exclusive agency    military independent agency 
   united investors agency    united american independent agency    united american exclusive agency    other    direct response marketing is conducted through direct mail  co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
it markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles and adults with face amounts of less than thousand on average 
the direct response operation is characterized by lower acquisition costs than torchmark s agency based marketing systems 
in each of the three years through  this distribution center had torchmark s highest growth in life insurance premium in dollar amount 
it accounted for over of torchmark s life insurance premium during direct response premium was million in  increasing over premium of million 
direct response life premium in grew over premium of million 
annualized premium sold by the direct response operation was million in  increasing over sales of million 
sales in rose over sales of million 
sales growth declined as compared with previous years due in part to the withdrawal from the under age adult direct mail market because of unfavorable financial results from that segment 
direct mail sales to ages to were interrupted for part of the year while those products were repriced to improve their financial results 
the annualized life premium issued by the direct response group represented over of torchmark s total life sales in direct response annualized life premium in force rose to million at december  from million a year earlier 
at december   direct response life annualized premium in force was second only to that of the liberty national exclusive agency 
direct response life insurance annualized premium in force grew in in addition to growth in life insurance sales and premium  the direct response operation has promoted growth in some of torchmark s agent based distribution channels through marketing support 
this support includes providing sales leads and assisting in agent recruiting 
this assistance has contributed indirectly to the growth in premium in other torchmark distribution agencies 
for example  direct response marketing support indirectly contributed to the increase in health sales by the united american exclusive agency through its assistance in the agent recruiting process and by providing leads to the agents 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system represented torchmark s largest contribution to life insurance premium income in each of the three years presented  with premium of million representing of total life premium 
the annualized life premium in force of the liberty agency was million at year end  compared with million and million at year end and  respectively 
life premium sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  grew during to million 
this million increase in annualized life premium sales by the liberty national agency was torchmark s largest in dollar amount  accounting for of the growth in annualized life premium issued 
life sales in this agency rose in to million  representing a turnaround in sales growth from a decline in sales in the turnaround in sales growth in the liberty agency was largely attributable to growth in the number of agents 
liberty s agents rose from a count of  agents at year end to  agents at year end  an increase of 
they further increased to  at year end improved agent recruitment efforts and training programs which help improve agent retention have been responsible for the new agent growth 
additionally  training programs have been employed to improve the retention of recruited agents 
agency productivity has also increased in  as average sales per agent rose over the prior year 
management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
the american income exclusive agency is a distribution system that focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
at december   premium from this system accounted for of torchmark s total life premium 
in  american income s premium increased to million  after having risen in to million 
annualized life premium in force was million at year end  an increase of over premium in force of million 
annualized life premium in force rose in and in sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  million in  and million in  declining in but increasing in growth in sales of this agency is dependent on the growth in the number of agents 
an decline in agent count was experienced in to  agents at december   and a further decline in the first half of resulted in  agents at june  however  changes in american income s marketing organization were implemented in to reverse the decline in the number of agents 
as a result  the american income agency had  agents at year end  an increase of in agents over june  management continues to make changes to american income s marketing organization to improve agent recruiting  retention  and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency 
another of torchmark s distribution channels for life insurance is a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by extremely low lapse rates 
life premium income from this distribution system grew to million in premium for this agency rose to million in these premium increases represented the largest percentage growth in life premium of any torchmark distribution channel in or annualized life premium in force for the military distribution system grew in to million  after having increased to million in in both years this distribution system produced the greatest amount of growth in annualized life premium in force on a percentage basis 
a major factor in this growth of in force premium relates to the very high persistency associated with this business 
annualized premium sold during by this agency was million  flat with sales of million 
sales in gained over sales of million in the united investors agency is made up of waddell reed sales representatives  who market the life insurance products of united investors life under a marketing agreement with waddell reed 
this agency accounted for of torchmark s life premium in premium income rose in to million  following a increase in to million 
sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  increasing over sales 
however  sales of million rose over sales of million 
annualized life premium in force increased to million at december   representing of torchmark s total life premium in force 
in addition to the growth in life insurance sales  this agency has also increased production of variable life collections in from million in to million in  an increase of 
variable life collections rose almost fourfold in although variable life collections are not included in premium in force data  they are indicative of growth in the variable life account balance 
indirectly  they add to premium revenue through the policy account charges for insurance coverage and administration as the account balance grows 
the united american independent and exclusive agencies represented about of total life premium in on a combined basis  life premium rose to million in after a increase in premium for these agencies increased in to million 
annualized life premium issued in was million  increasing over issues of million

these products were marketed through torchmark s direct response operation  and required torchmark to guarantee specified compensation to reader s digest  regardless of marketing success 
test marketing began in the fourth quarter of the less than favorable results from these tests indicated that it would be unlikely that torchmark would recover the full amount of compensation guaranteed to reader s digest under the terms of the agreement 
as a result  torchmark recorded a nonrecurring operating charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge represented million after tax or 
per diluted share 
torchmark intends to maintain its relationship with reader s digest and to use its subscriber lists in selective marketing of torchmark insurance products 
because of the nonrecurring charge  torchmark will only incur its normal solicitation costs on future business and will have no further costs related to the guaranteed compensation 
life insurance gross margins have been presented in the above table to remove the effect of family service underwriting income and the nonrecurring charge  which distort comparisons 
excluding these items  gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense  increased in to million after having risen in to million 
as a percentage of life insurance premium  life insurance gross margins were in both and  as compared with in slight increases in mortality have been experienced in both and over the prior year  resulting in increased obligation ratios 
fluctuations in mortality are normal in the life insurance industry and are not indicative of a trend 
health insurance 
torchmark markets its supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income during each of the three years ended december  by distribution method 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agency    liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agency    direct response    premium for the health insurance segment increased to million in over premium of million

health premium in force rose during sales of health insurance  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  increasing over sales of million 
sales in grew over the prior year 
sales of health insurance have accelerated greatly in the past three years due to increases in sales of medicare supplement policies 
prior to  torchmark had not experienced year over year sales growth in health insurance for five years 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies include medicare supplement  cancer  long term care  and other under age limited benefit supplemental medical and hospitalization products 
as a percentage of annualized health premium in force at december   medicare supplement accounted for  cancer  and other health products 
the table below presents torchmark s health insurance annualized premium in force by major product category at december  and for the two preceding years 
health insurance annualized premium in force by product dollar amounts in thousands at december  of of of amount total amount total amount total medicare supplement    cancer    other    total    medicare supplement insurance is sold primarily by the united american exclusive agency and the united american independent agency 
health sales in both agencies have grown significantly in the past three years 
the exclusive agency sold million in annualized health premium in  a increase over the prior year 
health sales for this agency rose in to million 
this agency accounted for million of the million in health premium growth in it also was instrumental in health annualized premium growth in both and  accounting for million of the million growth during in in force premium and adding million to annualized health premium in force in the united american exclusive agency represented of torchmark s annualized health premium in force at december   compared with a year earlier 
one factor in the growth in medicare supplement sales in the united american exclusive agency is the targeted marketing support provided by the direct response operation 
the united american independent agency continues to represent the largest amount of torchmark s health premium in force 
the agency s million of annualized health premium in force at december   of which million was medicare supplement premium in force  was of torchmark s total health premium in force 
this agency increased annualized health premium in force over the previous year for the first time at year end since health sales by the united american independent agency  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  a increase over sales rose to million in medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans  limits on first year agent compensation  and mandated minimum loss ratios 
however  they remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries 
about of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some of the deductibles and coinsurance for which the federal medicare program does not pay 
during the last few years  torchmark has focused on developing its united american exclusive agency to serve this market 
using the direct response operation  targeted marketing support and increased agent recruiting have led to increased sales 
because of loss ratio regulation  underwriting margins on medicare supplements are less than on torchmark s life business 
however  due to united american s low cost  service oriented customer service and claims administration  as well as its economies of scale  it is a profitable line of business 
until recently the primary competition for medicare supplement sales had come from medicare health maintenance organizations hmo s  the managed care alternative to traditional fee for service medicare which eliminated the need for a supplemental policy 
however  in the last few years  growing public dissatisfaction with managed care  increased medical cost inflation and increased federal government regulatory pressures on medicare hmo s have caused an increasing number of hmo s to withdraw from the market  reducing that competition 
other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market 
medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program cause the need for annual rate increases  which generally require state insurance department approval 
in addition  congress and the federal administration have begun studying ways to restructure the medicare program in the future as it is anticipated that the program could be insolvent within the next decade 
this would occur because of the growth in the number of baby boomers becoming eligible for medicare during that period and increasing medical cost inflation generally due to increased utilization 
therefore  it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program at sometime in the future 
however  regardless of proposed changes  it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs 
as a result  medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for senior age consumers 
cancer insurance premium in force grew in to million  compared with growth in sales of this product rose in to million from million 
sales in were also million 
growth in cancer annualized premium in force has been partially attributable to premium rate increases to offset increased health care costs 
cancer insurance products are sold primarily by the liberty national exclusive agency 
this agency represented of torchmark s total cancer annualized premium in force at december  annualized premium in force for other health products gained in to million  after declining in other health sales rose in to million  after having declined in health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium    policy obligations    required reserve inter est    net policy obligations    commissions and premium taxes    amortization of acquisi tion costs    required interest on de ferred acquisition costs    total expense    insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses 
   health insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense rose in to million  after having declined in as a percentage of premium  underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined in both of the years and from the prior year  respectively 
margins have lagged premium growth because of higher obligation costs 
medicare supplement margins are restrained by the federally mandated minimum loss ratio of and by competition 
cancer obligation ratios have increased in each year because of healthcare inflationary pressures 
to the extent management is able to obtain timely and adequate premium rate increases from regulatory authorities to offset these cost increases  margins may be stabilized on cancer business 
torchmark continues to seek such rate increases 
annuities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety of needs  including retirement income and long term  tax deferred growth opportunities 
torchmark s annuities are sold almost entirely by the united investors agency 
this agency consists of the waddell reed sales force which markets united investors annuities and other products under a marketing agreement 
in  this agency collected million of torchmark s total million in annuity collections  or 
the united investors agency accounted for almost of total annuity policy charges in annuities are also marketed by the united american independent agency  which collected million in annuity deposits in annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds managed by waddell reed  which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to fixed annuity policyholders 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities  excluding family service 
annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in dollar amounts in millions thousands fixed    variable       total       collections of fixed annuity premium were million in  compared with million in  an increase of 
fixed annuity premium collections declined in from million in management believes that the interest rate environment is a primary factor in the sales of fixed annuities 
the low interest rate environment of contributed to the lower sales as alternative investments grew more attractive 
in  as interest rates increased  fixed annuities became more desirable relative to alternative investments 
the fixed annuity deposit balance increased in to million at year end 
it rose in the prior year from million at year end to million at the end of during  torchmark sold family service  a wholly owned provider of funeral preneed annuities 
while the sale of these preneed annuities had been discontinued in  this block of fixed annuities remained on deposit until family was sold 
at the date of sale  this deposit balance was approximately million 
variable annuity collections were million in  increasing over the prior year 
variable collections rose to million in the strength in financial markets has had a positive influence on sales of variable annuities in all of the years through the variable annuity account balance continues to experience rapid growth 
the variable account balance rose in from billion at december  to billion at year end this balance had previously increased in and in strong financial markets in all of these periods contributed greatly to the growth 
variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities 
the additional collections in each year also added to the balances

policy charges have also grown in each period  rising in both and growth in policy charges is primarily related to the growth in the size of the account balance  but is also attributable to the increase in the number of annuity contracts in force and the cumulative effect of the growth in sales over the past few years upon which the sales charge is based 
investments 
the following table summarizes torchmark s investment income and excess investment income 
analysis of excess investment income dollar amounts in thousands net investment income    tax equivalency adjustment    tax equivalent investment income    required interest on net insurance policy liabilities interest on reserves    interest on deferred acquisition costs    net required    financing costs    excess investment income    mean invested assets at amortized cost    average net insurance policy liabilities    average debt including mips    excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and cash flow management 
it is defined as tax equivalent investment income reduced by the interest cost credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
excess investment income is increased in a number of ways an increase in investment yields over the rates credited to policyholders liabilities or in relationship to the rates applicable to torchmark debt  growth in invested assets in relation to policy liabilities and debt  and the efficient use of capital resources and cash flow 
net investment income declined in to million after rising to million in and to million in on a tax equivalent basis  in which the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities  investment income declined in after rising in both and the decline in investment income was a result of the sale of family service in the second quarter of and repurchases of torchmark stock since late the family service sale resulted in the investment of approximately million proceeds  producing an additional million of investment income in  compared with incremental investment income of million in however  the tax equivalent net investment income also included million earned on family service assets which were not includable in the family service sale also negatively impacted net investment income as tax equivalent net investment income included million on family service assets held for the entire year 
mean invested assets  computed based on book values  were flat in  compared with the year the growth in invested assets from reinvested cash flows were essentially offset by the loss of family service s million in invested assets when compared with the prior year 
in spite of the loss of family service s invested assets in  mean invested assets increased during over the prior year 
this increase was largely due to the receipt of million in proceeds from the waddell reed stock offering in early  offset to some extent by the sale of investments to repay debt and to acquire torchmark stock 
excess investment income increased in and in because the increases in excess investment income were greater than the growth in net investment income 
while the sale of family service caused a reduction in and investment income  it had little effect on excess investment income comparisons in either or the reduction in required interest on family service s policy liabilities offset the loss in investment income 
the increase in excess investment income resulted primarily from decreased financing costs 
the million increase in excess investment income resulted primarily from the proceeds of the waddell reed offering which provided torchmark with additional funds to invest or to apply to outstanding debt 
additionally  there was million of interest income on an internal financing with waddell reed included in income 
also in  torchmark essentially refinanced million principal amount of its long term debt with either short term debt or with sales of lower yielding investments  saving an average of basis points in financing costs 
during  torchmark entered into two transactions to dispose of the majority of its investment real estate 
the first transaction closed in july  and the other closed in october  total consideration for the combined transactions was million of which million was cash 
the real estate dispositions resulted in an after tax loss of million 
after the sales  torchmark retained million in investment real estate  of which million was represented by properties partially occupied by torchmark subsidiaries 
in addition to the real estate capital losses  torchmark has also generated million in after tax losses during from the planned sale of fixed maturities 
these losses allowed torchmark to carry back and recover capital gains taxes paid in prior years 
realized losses also included a million after tax loss from the decline in market value on the interest rate swap associated with torchmark s mips  discussed in more depth under the caption capital resources found on page of this discussion 
with the steady increase in interest rates during  new investments of corporate bonds afforded higher returns each successive quarter  and the average yield on fixed maturity purchases was the highest it had been since acquisitions in fixed maturity securities totaled billion in and billion in the acquisitions were made at an effective compounded yield of  compared with an effective compounded yield of for the prior year 
the yields equate to nominal yields on acquisitions of and for and  respectively 
during  the yield curve flattened with short term yields approaching long term yields 
in fact  the yield curve inverted in early  with short term yields exceeding long term yields 
this flattening allowed the purchase of new investments at higher yields with shorter maturities as compared with the average life of acquired securities was years in  compared with years in and years in in the fourth quarter of  the average life of acquired securities was years 
although acquisitions were made at a higher average yield than in the past six years  the new investment yield was slightly below the average yield of the portfolio  resulting in a basis point decline in the nominal portfolio yield at year end at december   the fixed maturity portfolio had an estimated nominal yield of  compared with in and in the average life of the portfolio was years at year end  increasing from years at year end and years at the year end duration also rose at year end to years from the year level at the end of and year level at the end of the increase in average life and duration was impacted primarily by the purchase of securities with longer maturities than the prior year average maturity 
emphasis continues to be on marketable  high and medium quality investments 
approximately of invested assets are fixed maturity securities  and of these holdings are rated investment grade by standard poor s

a considerable portion of the portfolio is expected to repay or mature within the next several years  as indicated by the following table

market risk sensitivity 
market risk is a risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions 
torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk which is the risk that a change in a security s value could occur because of a change in interest rates 
this risk is significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed income holdings amount to of total investments 
the effects of these interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity because these investments are marked to market 
the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt 
interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark s insurance liabilities 
these liabilities  net of deferred acquisition costs  were billion at december   compared with fixed income investments of billion at amortized cost at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
these liabilities are not marked to market 
market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives 
torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of high quality fixed maturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions 
a significant change in the level of interest rates  changes in credit quality of individual securities  or changes in the relative values of a security or asset sector are the primary factors that influence such sales 
occasionally  the need to raise cash for various operating commitments may also necessitate the sale of a security 
volatility in the value of torchmark s fixed income holdings is reduced by maintaining a relatively short term portfolio  of which matures within five years and matures within ten years 
also  the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for appropriate action 
no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
an interest rate swap instrument was entered into to allow torchmark to participate in the downward trend in interest rates in connection with its mips as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page of this report and in capital resources on page of this report 
a cap instrument was also entered into to protect torchmark from the market risk on an increase in rates associated with the swap on this security 
this cap expired during the liability for torchmark s insurance policy obligations is computed using interest assumptions  some of which are contractually guaranteed 
a reduction in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return to fall below amounts guaranteed 
torchmark s insurance companies participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations  the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the company s obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
those procedures indicate that torchmark s insurance policy liabilities  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets  are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmark s insurance activities in all but the most extreme circumstances 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and december  this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data is prepared through a model that measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments would have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in at at basis december  december  points financial condition liquidity 
torchmark s liquidity relates to its ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is very strong  as evidenced by its three sources of liquidity its positive cash flow from operations  its portfolio of marketable securities  and its line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations generate positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations were million in  compared with million in and million in in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million in investment maturities and repayments during  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at december   compared with million at year end in addition to these highly liquid assets  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities  which are available for sale should the need arise 
these securities had a value of billion at december  torchmark has a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings up to a specified maximum amount 
the maximum amount on this facility was million at december  interest is charged at variable rates for borrowings 
this line of credit is further designated as a backup credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time but may not borrow in excess of a total of million on the combined facilities 
at december   million in face amount of commercial paper was outstanding and there were no borrowings on the line of credit 
a fee is charged on the entire million facility 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
dividends are paid by subsidiaries to the parent in order to meet its dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
these requirements have declined in both and from the respective prior year 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations  excluding capital gains and losses  on an annual noncumulative basis  or of surplus  in the absence of special approval 
distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries has been and is expected to be more than adequate for parent company operations 
during the year  a maximum amount of million will be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of long and short term debt  mips  and shareholders equity 
torchmark s debt consists primarily of its funded debt and its commercial paper facility 
an analysis of torchmark s funded debt outstanding at year ends and on the basis of par value was as follows principal principal year amount amount instrument due rate thousands thousands senior debentures   notes   notes   total funded debt   debt held by subsidiaries   long term debt   the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
through its insurance subsidiaries  torchmark has reacquired a portion of its funded debt in the open market 
in  million principal amount of its notes due were acquired at a cost of million 
also in  million principal amount of its notes due were purchased for million 
in  torchmark bought million of its notes at a price of million 
insurance company holdings in the funded debt reduce consolidated debt outstanding 
during  torchmark received approximately million in intercompany note repayments from waddell reed as a result of their initial public offering 
torchmark utilized a portion of these funds to pay down funded debt 
it also took advantage of the lower interest rate environment in to refinance existing funded debt at lower short term rates 
in early  torchmark repaid million principal amount on its sinking fund debentures due in  of which million was a mandatory redemption and million was an optional repayment under the terms of the agreement 
on april   torchmark called the remaining million principal balance of this debt at the prevailing call price of  or million 
a loss on the redemption of debt was recorded in the second quarter of in the after tax amount of million  representing the difference between the total call price and the carrying value of million 
in addition to the call  torchmark s senior notes  principal amount million  matured on may  torchmark borrowed on its commercial paper facility to repay the sinking fund debentures that were called and to repay its senior notes upon maturity with accrued interest  in the combined amount of million 
during  torchmark repaid million principal amount on its sinking fund debentures due in  of which million was a mandatory redemption and million was an optional repayment under the terms of the agreement 
the mips were issued in november  at a redemption amount of million with an annual dividend rate of 
they are subject to a mandatory redemption in full at september   although torchmark may elect to extend the mips for up to an additional years if certain conditions are met 
they are currently redeemable at torchmark s option at any time 
while torchmark is obligated to pay dividends at a fixed rate of  torchmark has in place a ten year interest rate swap agreement with an unaffiliated party 
the swap agreement calls for torchmark to pay a variable rate on the million face amount in exchange for payment of the fixed dividend by the other party 
the swap expires in torchmark is at risk on this instrument for higher financing costs to the extent interest rates rise during the remaining term 
at december   the variable rate was 
during  torchmark s after tax dividend cost for the mips was million  compared with million that would have been incurred without the swap 
torchmark s after tax cost in was million and in was million  saving million and million in each of those years  respectively 
effective january   torchmark changed its method of accounting for the swap agreement to recognize changes in its fair value  net of tax  as realized investment gains or losses 
this method of accounting for such instruments was believed to be preferable under the guidance established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for futures contracts sfas and the securities and exchange commission 
previously  torchmark accounted for the swap using hedge accounting under sfas the after tax cumulative effect of the change at january  was million net of income taxes of million 
the effect of the change on the twelve months ended december  was to increase realized losses by million 
per diluted share  excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principal 
market value of the swap at december  was million 
during july   torchmark filed with the securities and exchange commission a form s registration statement for the shelf registration of capital securities in an aggregate face amount of million 
proceeds from the issuance of any such capital securities could be used for the possible purchase of torchmark securities  for working capital  for the repayment of debt  for acquisitions  or for any other general corporate purpose or business opportunity 
short term debt consists primarily of torchmark s commercial paper outstanding 
the commercial paper balance outstanding at december  was million at carrying value  compared with a balance of million a year earlier 
the commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmark s current cash needs 
as previously noted  torchmark essentially refinanced million face amount of funded debt in with additional short term borrowings 
these borrowings were offset somewhat by the use of million in waddell reed offering proceeds for repayment 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was at december  in the computation of this ratio  the mips are counted as equity and the effect of fluctuations in security values based on changes in interest rates in financial markets are excluded 
this debt to capitalization ratio was at year end and at year end the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio at year end was caused by the increase in short term borrowings 
the decline in this ratio resulted primarily from the funded debt paydowns  net of the increase in short term debt 
the debt to capitalization ratio was also favorably impacted by the net increase in torchmark s shareholders equity resulting from the waddell reed offering and spin off 
torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest  taxes and discontinued operations to interest requirements was in  compared with in and in torchmark s interest expense declined to million in  largely as a result of lower average debt than in there was also a larger proportion of short term debt in compared with the prior year  resulting in lower borrowing costs 
in  interest expense declined to million primarily because of the funded debt paydowns 
torchmark resumed its share buyback program in november  after completion of the waddell reed spin off 
torchmark purchased million shares on the open market at a cost of million in purchases of million shares were made in late at a cost of million 
during  torchmark acquired million shares at a cost of million 
torchmark will continue to make share purchases under its share repurchase program on the open market when prices are attractive 
share purchases could have a favorable impact on earnings per share and return on equity  but negatively affect book value per share 
on november   torchmark executed a stock option exercise and restoration program through which torchmark directors and employees exercised vested stock options and received a reduced number of replacement options at the current market price 
this program resulted in the issuance of million shares  but over million of the new shares were immediately sold by the directors and employees through the open market to cover the cost of the purchased shares and the related taxes 
as a result of the restoration program  management s ownership interest increased  and torchmark received a significant current tax benefit from the exercise of the options 
shareholders equity declined to billion at december  shareholders equity rose in  from billion at year end to billion at year end the decrease was impacted by the decrease in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio due to increases in interest rates in the financial markets 
the growth in shareholders equity was greatly impacted by the waddell reed offering and spin off in that year 
proceeds from the march  offering added million to torchmark s shareholders equity  but equity was reduced by million of minority interest at the time of the offering representing the of waddell reed that torchmark no longer owned 
additionally  the november  spin off caused a reduction in torchmark s equity of million  representing its carrying value of waddell reed at the time of the spin 
book value per share was at year end  compared with at year end after adjusting for the impact on shareholders equity for security value fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in financial markets  shareholders equity rose from billion at year end to billion at year end book value per share was at year end  an increase of over at year end return on common shareholders equity was in  compared with in the return on equity ratios exclude the mark up or down of shareholders equity for changes in security values caused by fluctuations in market interest rates 
they are also computed on a basis of net operating income before nonrecurring charge  as defined on page through of this report 
other items transactions regarding vesta insurance group 
since  torchmark has held a passive investment in vesta  a property insurance carrier 
torchmark held million shares of vesta stock  or approximately of the outstanding shares of vesta  until december  torchmark carried its investment in vesta during this period on the equity method of accounting 
in june   vesta announced that a an investigation of accounting irregularities that occurred during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of would result in an aggregate million net after tax reduction in previously reported net income  and  in addition  that b it would restate its historical financial statements for the period of through the first quarter of  reflecting reductions in reported net after tax earnings of million for the period of through and million for the first quarter of to reflect its pro rata share of vesta s cumulative reported financial corrections  torchmark recorded a pre tax charge of million million after tax or 
per diluted share in the second quarter of as a result of the announcements relating to vesta and the decline in value of vesta stock  vesta is currently subject to numerous class action lawsuits in state and federal courts filed subsequent to such announcements 
in the fourth quarter of  torchmark announced its intention to dispose of its holdings in vesta and to sell vesta shares under satisfactory terms 
in december   torchmark sold thousand vesta shares at a price of per share  recording a loss of million after tax 
in  vesta filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the public offering of its shares held by torchmark 
to facilitate the registration of vesta shares  torchmark reacquired the previously sold thousand shares at a price of per share 
on november   the registration statement was filed by vesta to offer all of torchmark s holdings in vesta 
because of its intention to dispose of vesta  torchmark wrote its carrying value of vesta down to net realizable amount effective september  the adjustment produced an after tax realized loss of million  or 
per diluted torchmark share 
net realizable value was million at december  during  torchmark recorded a pretax loss of million million after tax or 
per diluted share on vesta operations  including its pro rata share of vesta s cumulative accounting corrections 
during the first quarter of  the two torchmark directors who occupied seats on the vesta board of directors resigned from those vesta seats 
due to the vacating of the vesta board seats and the absence of significant influence regarding vesta  torchmark discontinued the equity method of accounting for vesta and has included vesta in equity securities at market value subsequent to december  torchmark carried vesta at a value of million at december  litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  most of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty national in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results 
it is impossible to predict the extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case  since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material 
new accounting rules accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb statement no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application of all of the provisions of this statement encouraged 
early adoption of selective provisions is prohibited 
prior periods may not be restated for comparability 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of derivative instruments 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and be measured at fair value 
changes in the values of derivatives for the reporting period are reflected as adjustments to earnings through realized gains and losses 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated as a hedge against exposure to market risks of other instruments or commitments  cash flow risks  or foreign currency risks 
if a derivative is classified as a hedge  the adjustment to earnings is offset by a corresponding change in the value of the item hedged 
hedging relationships may be designated anew upon adoption of this statement 
management believes that statement will have an immaterial impact on torchmark s financial statements 
other than the interest rate swap on its mips  which is carried at fair market value  torchmark s use of derivatives is limited
