item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains both historical information and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include projections and other statements of events that may occur at some point in the future 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as under item business  including  what factors could cause our results to differ significantly from those you might expect and what other matters should stockholders consider with respect to the company overview we are an early stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecules 
we invest our own resources on discovering and developing therapeutics for the treatment of various types of cancer and we collaborate with large pharmaceutical companies in discovering therapeutics for chronic diseases for which there are large markets 
we have three affiliated companies that were formed to provide capital to axys for our drug discovery operations axys advanced technologies aat  which began operations in and set up as a wholly owned subsidiary in is a owned subsidiary that markets combinatorial chemistry compounds  enabling technology and services 
it has been profitable since inception 
financial results of aat are consolidated into axys financial results 
akkadix corporation akkadix  an agricultural biotechnology company founded in is owned by axys 
it has incurred losses since inception 
akkadix is separately managed and is funded by third parties 
akkadix financial results were consolidated into axys financial results though august in september axys ownership in akkadix reduced to below 
as a result  akkadix is now accounted for under the equity method 
ppgx  inc ppgx  a pharmacogenomics subsidiary founded in  is owned by axys and owned by ppd  inc financial results of ppgx are consolidated into axys financial results 
it has incurred losses since inception  is separately managed and is funded by third parties 
to date  we have not generated any product revenue in its drug discovery programs and do not expect to generate such revenues for at least several years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our sources of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under corporate partnerships  interest income and sales made by our aat subsidiary 
the process of developing our products will require significant additional research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approval 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses are expected to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
axys will not receive product revenue or royalties in our drug discovery programs unless our collaborative partners complete clinical trials and successfully commercialize one or more of our products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that aat will remain profitable  or that akkadix or ppgx will ever provide funding for our drug discovery operations 
we are subject to risks common to early stage drug discovery and development companies  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts and clinical trials  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approval 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us  and in some programs  our collaborators  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements as well as obtain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and events which affected the company s operations in december we completed the closing of our la jolla  ca operations and relocated our oncology genomics activities to our south san francisco headquarters 
as a result of this action  a one time restructure charge of million was taken in in september  akkadix corporation akkadix  formerly known as xyris corporation completed its acquisition of global agro  inc global 
as a result of this acquisition  the company s interest in akkadix fell below and akkadix will now be accounted for under the equity method 
in february  we formed a majority owned subsidiary  ppgx  inc ppgx which is engaged in the business of providing pharmacogenomic the science of how genetic variations among individuals affects drug safety and efficacy products and services to the pharmaceutical industry 
in connection with the formation of ppgx  axys contributed certain assets and technology in exchange for an ownership interest in ppgx 
ppd  inc ppd  axys partner in ppgx  contributed certain assets  technology  cash and loan guarantees in exchange for an ownership interest in ppgx and the exclusive  worldwide right to market the pharmacogenomic products and services of ppgx 
our collaborative research programs generally contain one or more of the following sources of revenue to us research support payments that are generally based on the number of researchers axys is committing to a particular program 
these revenues are recorded when earned through the performance of the required research by axys 
license fees payments that are generally received when the collaboration agreement is signed 
these revenues are amortized over the term of the agreement 
commitment fees payments that are generally received in conjunction with our commitment to perform certain funded research 
these revenues are recorded over the course of the research efforts 
milestone payments payments that are based on our or our partner achieving certain technical or regulatory milestones in the collaboration 
these revenues are recorded upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones 
premiums paid on equity investments premiums paid in excess of the fair market value of the company s stock is recognized as revenue over the research period 
our sales of chemical compound libraries contain one or more of the following sources of revenue to us product sales as chemical compound libraries are shipped to customers of aat  we record revenue based on the contracted price per compound 
license fees payments that are generally received when compound supply or technology license agreements are signed 
these revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement 
commitment fees payments that are received in conjunction with aat s commitment to perform certain obligations under compound supply or technology license agreements 
these revenues are recorded over the course of the relevant agreement  as performance obligations are completed 
protocol fees payments that are received in exchange for technology know how 
these revenues are recorded as protocols are delivered 
we have not been profitable since inception and expects to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to the cost of its research and development programs  including preclinical studies and human clinical trials 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  that such fluctuations may be substantial  and that results from prior quarters may not be indicative of future operating results 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
included in our accumulated deficit at december  was approximately million of acquired in process research and development from the acquisition of khepri pharmaceuticals  inc in and the acquisition of sequana in january revenues collaboration and licensing revenues our collaboration and licensing revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in collaboration and licensing revenues which generally consist of research support and license fees  for the year ended december  were attributable to the collaborative research agreements with i parke davis for the gene identification program in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  ii aventis for the development of small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cathepsin s  associated with certain inflammatory diseases  iii bristol myers squibb for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in hepatitis c virus infection  and iv merck for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in osteoporosis 
revenues decreased when compared to due to lower revenues recognized under the following agreements i the end of research support in june under the boehringer ingelheim international gmbh agreement for the gene identification program in asthma  ii the winding down of the parke davis gene identification program for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  and iii the end of research funding in mid of the pharmacia upjohn agreement for the development of inhibitors of factor xa 
as axys has shifted its focus to proprietary oncology programs  collaboration and licensing revenues are expected to continue to decline 
product revenues our product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase was primarily due to the overall increase in compound libraries shipped in  when compared to  in accordance with the terms of the combinatorial chemistry agreements with pharmacia upjohn  parke davis  aventis  daiichi  allergan  as well as with other smaller biotechnology companies 
ppgx accounted for approximately  of product revenue in cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to more compound libraries shipped in than under the combinatorial chemistry agreements 
cost of goods has a direct relationship to product revenues 
research and development our research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase was primarily due to research and development expenses related to axys affiliates ppgx and akkadix  which are not funded by axys  as indicated in the table below 
another contributing factor to the increase was the reduction of approximately individuals in the first quarter of  with an associated severance cost of approximately  akkadix activities are reflected in the consolidated results of the company through the date of its merger with global agro  which means through the first eight months of other drug affiliated discovery aat businesses total year ended year ended increase decrease when we acquired sequana in january  sequana had the following research programs in progress asthma  partnered with boehringer ingelheim int l gmbh  osteoporosis  partnered with corange international ltd  non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm  partnered with glaxo wellcome  inc  schizophrenia bipolar  partnered with parke davis pharmaceutical research division of warner lambert company  obesity  alzheimer s and pharmacogenomics 
as of december  the schizophrenia bipolar program was transferred to parke davis and the pharmacogenomics program was spun off into the ppgx subsidiary with ppd 
all other programs have ended 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in decreases were primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the winding down of activities in our la jolla operation 
these decreases were offset by the addition of administrative expenses of our newly formed affiliates  ppgx and akkadix  not funded by axys 
other drug affiliated discovery aat businesses total year ended year ended increase decrease interest income and interest expense interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average cash and investment balances between the periods 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   from in the decrease was primarily due to the lower debt balances from our lines of credit and existing leasing arrangements 
equity interest in loss of joint venture equity interest in loss of joint venture decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in and was due to the decrease in the loss for genos 
this amount represents axys portion of genos loss for based on our ownership of genos 
the decrease is primarily due to the winding down of operations of genos since may in the third quarter of  we wrote off the balance of the investment in genos 
minority interest minority interest represents another investor s share of a subsidiary s operating income loss  where the company owns to of that subsidiary 
minority interest increased to million for the year ended december  from  in this amount is the result of the formation of the company s majority owned subsidiary  ppgx  in and akkadix  in since we report all of ppgx s expenses as our expenses see general and administrative above  this one line allocates a portion of ppgx s loss to the minority shareholders  and reduces our operating loss 
restructuring charge in december  we completed the closing of our la jolla  ca operations and relocated our oncology genomics activities to its south san francisco headquarters 
as a result of this action  a one time charge of million was taken during the third quarter  of which million related to severance and other employee related costs  million related to facilities costs  million related to the disposal of assets  and in other costs associated with the restructuring 
in the fourth quarter the restructure charge was reduced by million  to million due to a change in estimates resulting from the additional subleases of the la jolla facility we leased  and for better than expected proceeds from the disposal of equipment and other assets associated with closing down the la jolla facility 
the facilities costs included lease payments on facilities vacated in la jolla net of proceeds from existing subleases 
as a result of closing the facility  we eliminated positions of which are included in the severance calculation and positions were eliminated through attrition and cancellation of open requisitions 
at december   the only remaining accrual relating to the restructuring was approximately million which will be utilized through december  other income expense other income and expense represents primarily the write off of axys interest in genos  a joint venture with memorial sloan kettering cancer center  totaling million 
years ended december  and events which affected the company s operations on january  we completed the acquisition of sequana therapeutics  inc sequana  a genomics company of approximately employees based in la jolla  california 
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of sequana in exchange for axys common stock 
in general  sequana was a company of similar size and complexity to axys 
sequana s revenues were primarily derived from collaborative research agreements with most of the same components as those described above for axys 
consequently  in comparing the operating results of the company for the periods ended december  and  sequana contributed in large part to the doubling of all of the line items on the statement of operations  except product revenues and cost of goods sold  which were applicable to of axys alone 
revenues collaboration and licensing revenues our collaboration and licensing revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to the acquisition sequana 
if the acquisition had occurred prior to  revenues on a pro forma basis for would have been million  and would have therefore been million lower in collaboration and licensing revenues for the year ended december  were attributable to the material collaborative research agreements with i parke davis for the gene identification program in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  and includes research funding  ii boehringer ingelheim for the gene identification program in asthma  and include research funding  iii bristol myers squibb for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in hepatitis c virus infection and include research funding  as well as a licensing fee  iv merck for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in osteoporosis  and include research funding and the amortization of an up front licensing fee  and v aventis for the development of small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cathepsin s  associated with certain inflammatory diseases  and include a licensing fee 
although some of these agreements were new  revenues decreased when compared to on a pro forma basis because of lower revenues recognized under the following agreements i the end of research funding in july of the pharmacia upjohn agreement for the development of inhibitors of factor xa  ii the end of the research phase in november of the bayer agreement to develop inhibitors of the regulatory enzymes tryptase and chymase for the treatment of asthma  iii the termination of the glaxo agreement for the genomics work in the area of type ii diabetes and related conditions  and iv the end of the research phase of the smithkline beechum agreement in december for the inhibition of intracellular viral proteases 
product revenues our product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase was primarily due to the overall increase in compound libraries shipped in  when compared to  in accordance with the terms of the combinatorial chemistry agreements with pharmacia upjohn  parke davis and rhone poulenc rorer 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to more compound libraries being shipped in than under the three agreements discussed above 
research and development our research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to the acquisition of sequana and additional costs associated with the clinical trials of apc  prior to the termination of that program 
if the acquisition of sequana had occurred prior to  research and development expenses would have been million in on a pro forma basis 
the increase on a pro forma basis to million in from million in was due to the increase in clinical trial costs discussed above  as well as the expanded research efforts in drug discovery 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to the sequana acquisition and the planning of our strategic initiative in oncology 
additionally  general and administrative expenses for included all of the expenses of our subsidiary  xyris  due to our ownership at december  further expansions in general and administrative expenses took place in legal  finance and business development to support our expanded research and development efforts 
these increases for were offset in part by the elimination of approximately million of outside service costs  executive management  and other administrative expense from the combining of arris as the company was previously known and sequana 
if the acquisition of sequana had occurred prior to  pro forma basis general and administrative expenses would have been million in the increase  on a pro forma basis to million in from million in was primarily due to one time charges related to the integration of sequana  as well as the other administrative costs discussed above 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development ipr d expense increased to million for the year ended december  due to our acquisition of sequana therapeutics on january  that acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the million purchase price was allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their respective estimated fair values 
as a result  million was allocated to acquired ipr d 
the million was expensed as a non recurring charge on the acquisition date because the acquired in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no future alternative uses  and all programs were still in the research phase 
the value of sequana s projects was determined after estimating the net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the net cash flows were based on the company s estimate of revenue  research and development costs  general and administrative costs and income taxes 
when we acquired sequana in january  sequana had the following research programs in progress asthma  partnered with boehringer ingelheim int l gmbh  osteoporosis  partnered with corange international ltd  non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus niddm  partnered with glaxo wellcome  inc  schizophrenia bipolar  partnered with parke davis pharmaceutical research division of warner lambert company  obesity  alzheimer s and pharmacogenomics 
as of december  the schizophrenia bipolar program was transferred to parke davis and the pharmacogenomics program was spun off into the ppgx subsidiary with ppd 
all other programs have ended 
interest income and interest expense interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase was primarily due to the increase in average cash and investment balances between the periods  as a result of the acquisition of sequana 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   from in the increase was primarily due to the higher debt balances from our two lines of credit and existing leasing arrangements following the acquisition of sequana 
we have generally used drawdowns from its lending arrangements for capital equipment leasehold improvements 
equity interest in loss of joint venture equity interest in loss of joint venture increased to million for the year ended december   and was due to the increase in the loss for genos  which was acquired as part of our acquisition of sequana 
this amount represents our portion of genos loss for based on our percentage ownership 
minority interest minority interest represents another investor s share of a subsidiary s operating income loss  where we own to of that subsidiary 
minority interest increased to  for the year ended december  from none in this amount is the result of the formation of our majority owned subsidiary  xyris 
since we report all of xyris expenses as our expenses see general and administrative above  this one line allocates a portion of xyris loss to the minority shareholders  and reduces our operating loss 
recent accounting pronouncements in december the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that license and other up front fees from research collaborators be recognized over the term of the agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
the effect of this change in accounting principle will not have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities sfas which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is not anticipated to have an impact on our results of operations of financial condition when adopted as we hold no derivative financial instruments and does not currently engage in hedging activities 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of capital stock  through corporate collaborative research agreements  and sales of combinatorial chemistry compounds 
as of december   we had realized approximately million in net proceeds from offerings of our capital stock 
in addition  we have realized approximately million since inception from our collaborative research agreements and the sale of compound libraries 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and investments  which totaled million as of december  we have a million line of credit under which we had borrowed a total of million as of december  the line is available through july  ppgx has an million line of credit that is guaranteed by ppd  under which it had borrowed million as of december  this line is available through june  our cash and investments at december  include the cash and investments from our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
our investments also serve as security for our borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash used in operating activities during year ended december  was million compared to million in the same period in the increase was primarily due to lower revenues and the costs associated with the wind down of operations in la jolla for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities is expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending in part upon the timing and amounts  if any  of cash received from existing and any new collaboration agreements or the sale of combinatorial chemistry compound libraries 
we also spent approximately million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment during the year ended december  we expect to acquire or lease additional equipment in connection with our future research and development activities  although the magnitude of such purchases or leases is not presently known 
there were no material commitments for capital expenditures outstanding at december  our aat subsidiary currently has approximately million of backlog from committed contracts for the sale of combinatorial chemistry libraries as of december  our material commitments at december  included our obligations to perform research under our collaboration agreements with merck and aventis for which we are fully funded from our partner  our obligations to develop  produce and deliver combinatorial compounds and transfer related technology under aat s combinatorial chemistry agreements with parke davis  daiichi and allergan for which we receive payments in excess of our costs  our obligations to pay for research at signal pharmaceuticals and our obligations under our line of credit 
we believe that our existing cash and investments including the proceeds of the million stock issuance described below will be more than sufficient for us to fulfill our commitments to signal pharmaceuticals for research support of approximately million in and the lender under our line of credit  which had a million balance outstanding at december  see also note to the company s financial statements for all of the company s commitments under capital and operating leases 
in february   we entered into definitive purchase agreements for the sale of an aggregate million newly issued shares of axys pharmaceuticals  inc common stock to selected institutional and other accredited investors for million in gross proceeds 
we intend to use net proceeds from this private placement for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we expect that existing cash and investments  revenues from existing collaborations  and the net proceeds from our recently completed private placement  together with debt financing which we believe is available to us  will enable us to maintain current and planned operations for months 
we continue to actively pursue a variety of financing alternatives 
the drug development process is expensive and we are at an early stage of development 
therefore  we expect we will continue to need to raise money in the future until we achieve substantial product or royalty revenues  if ever 
we expect that we will continue to seek additional funding from time to time through one or more of the following new collaborations  the extension of existing collaborations  the sale of our interests in our affiliated businesses  or through public or private equity or debt financings 
furthermore  we may obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to give up rights to technologies or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available or that  if available  the terms will be acceptable 
existing stockholders will experience dilution of their investment if additional funds are raised through private or public stock sales 
if adequate funds are not available  we may delay  reduce or eliminate any of our research or development programs 
impact of the year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we expensed approximately  during and in in connection with remediating our systems 
during  we expect to remediate certain non critical systems at an estimated cost of  that will be funded through operating cash flows 
any remaining expense relates to other remediation efforts and will be charged to expense as incurred 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the composition of our interest earning assets mature within one year and interest bearing liabilities  we believe that the market risk is not significant
