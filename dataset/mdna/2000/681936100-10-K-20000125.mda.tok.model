item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains additional information concerning liquidity and capital resources 
government healthcare regulation and reimbursements the healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal  state and local law  and is directly affected by state and local licensure  fines and loss of certification to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs  as well as potential criminal penalties 
the balanced budget act of budget act enacted a number of anti fraud and abuse provisions and contains civil monetary penalties for an operator s violation of the anti kickback laws 
the budget act also imposes an affirmative duty on operators to ensure they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the medicare or other governmental programs 
it also provides a minimum ten year period for exclusion for participation in federal healthcare programs for operators convicted of a prior healthcare offense 
governmental investigations and enforcement of healthcare laws have increased dramatically and are expected to continue to increase 
the increase in governmental investigations could have adverse effects on an operator s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition which could also adversely affect an operator s ability to make timely rent or interest payments to the company 
additionally  the budget act  future healthcare legislation or other changes in administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  financial condition or results of operations of the company s operators  which could also have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rent and interest payments to the company 
potential reduction in revenues of lessees borrowers due to healthcare reform 
all of the company s properties are used as healthcare facilities  and therefore  the company is directly affected by the risk associated with the healthcare industry 
the company s lessees and mortgagors derive a substantial portion of their net operating revenues from third party payers  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
such programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
effective january   the majority of skilled nursing facilities shifted from payments based on reimbursable cost to a prospective payment system pps for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
implementation of pps will affect each long term care facility to a different degree depending upon the amount of revenue it derives from medicare patients 
long term care facilities may need to restructure their operations to operate profitably under the new medicare pps reimbursement 
in addition  private payers  including managed care payers  are increasingly demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk of operating a healthcare facility 
efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls are expected to continue 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement levels could adversely affect revenues of the company s lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees and borrowers abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to the company 
the possibility that the healthcare facilities will not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses or will yield returns lower than those available through investments in comparable real estate or other investments are additional risks of investing in healthcare related real estate 
income from properties and yields from investments in such properties may be affected by many factors  including changes in governmental regulation such as zoning laws  general or local economic conditions such as fluctuations in interest rates and employment conditions  the available local supply and demand for improved real estate  a reduction in rental income as the result of an inability to maintain occupancy levels  natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods or similar factors 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit the ability of the company to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
all of the company s properties are special purpose properties that could not be readily converted to general residential  retail or office use 
healthcare facilities that participate in medicare and or medicaid programs must meet extensive program requirements  including physical plant and operational requirements  which are revised from time to time 
such requirements may include a duty to admit medicare and medicaid patients  limiting the ability of the facility to increase its private pay census beyond certain limits 
medicare and medicaid facilities are regularly inspected to determine compliance and may be excluded from the programs in some cases without a prior hearing for failure to meet program requirements 
transfers of nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities between operators are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate 
thus  if the operation of any of the company s properties becomes unprofitable due to competition  age of improvements or other factors such that the lessee or borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the lease or mortgage loan  the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less  particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan  than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses 
other changes in the healthcare industry include continuing trends toward shorter lengths of stay  increased use of outpatient services  increased federal  state and third party regulation and oversight of healthcare company operations and business practices and increased demand for capitated healthcare services delivery of services at a fixed price per capita basis to a defined group of covered parties 
the entrance of insurance companies into managed care programs is also accelerating the introduction of managed care in new localities  and states and insurance companies continue to negotiate actively the amounts they will pay for services 
moreover  the percentage of healthcare services that are reimbursed under medicare and medicaid programs continues to increase as the population ages and as states expand their medicaid programs 
continued eligibility to participate in these programs is crucial to a provider s financial strength 
finally  healthcare regulation through certificates of need con has tended to limit construction of new long term care facilities in many states 
several states in which the company has investments have repealed con legislation  including california and texas 
as a result of the foregoing  the revenues and margins of the operators of the company s facilities may decrease  resulting in a reduction of the company s rent interest coverage from investments 
potential risks from bankruptcies generally  the company s lease arrangements with a single operator who operates more than one of the company s facilities is pursuant to a single master lease a master lease or collectively  the master leases 
although each lease or master lease provides that the company may terminate the master lease upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the tenant  the bankruptcy reform act of bankruptcy code provides that a trustee in a bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding under the bankruptcy code or debtor in possession in a reorganization under the bankruptcy code has the power and the option to assume or reject the unexpired lease obligations of a debtor lessee 
in the event that the unexpired lease is assumed on behalf of the debtor lessee  all the rental obligations thereunder generally would be entitled to a priority over other unsecured claims 
however  the court also has the power to modify a lease if a debtor lessee in a reorganization were required to perform certain provisions of a lease that the court determined to be unduly burdensome 
it is not possible to determine at this time whether or not any lease or master lease contains any such provisions 
if a lease is rejected  the lessor has a general unsecured claim limited to any unpaid rent already due plus an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease  without acceleration  for the greater of one year or of the remaining term of such lease  not to exceed three years 
if any lease is rejected  the company may also lose the benefit of any participation interest or conversion right 
generally  with respect to the company s mortgage loans  the imposition of an automatic stay under the bankruptcy code precludes lenders from exercising foreclosure or other remedies against the debtor 
a mortgagee also is treated differently from a landlord in three key respects 
first  the mortgage loan is not subject to assumption or rejection because it is not an executory contract or a lease 
second  the mortgagee s loan may be divided into a secured loan for the portion of the mortgage debt that does not exceed the value of the property and a general unsecured loan for the portion of the mortgage debt that exceeds the value of the property 
a secured creditor such as the company is entitled to the recovery of interest and costs only if and to the extent that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed 
if the value of the collateral is less than the debt  a lender such as the company would not receive or be entitled to any interest for the time period between the filing of the case and confirmation 
if the value of the collateral does exceed the debt  interest and allowed costs may not be paid during the bankruptcy proceeding  but accrue until confirmation of a plan or reorganization or some other time as the court orders 
finally  while a lease generally would either be rejected or assumed with all of its benefits and burdens intact  the terms of a mortgage  including the rate of interest and timing of principal payments  may be modified if the debtor is able to effect a cramdown under the bankruptcy code 
the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
in order to protect its investments  the company may take possession of a property or even become licensed as an operator  which might expose the company to successorship liability to government programs or require indemnity of subsequent operators to whom it might transfer the operating rights and licenses 
should such events occur  the company s income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 
see note mortgage notes receivable and note concentration of risk to the company s consolidated financial statements with respect to certain of the company s tenants and mortgagors 
competition the company competes for additional healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other real estate investment trusts 
the operators of the facilities compete with other regional or local nursing care facilities for the support of the medical community  including physicians and acute care hospitals  as well as the general public 
some significant competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care nursing facilities include quality of care  reputation  physical appearance of the facilities  services offered  family preferences  physician services and price 
possible change of investment strategies and policies and capital structure the board of directors  without the approval of the shareholders  may alter the company s investment strategies and policies if they determine in the future that such a change is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
the methods of implementing the company s investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed 
federal income tax considerations at all times  the company intends to make and manage its investments including the sale or disposition of property or other investments and to operate in such a manner as to be consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code or regulations thereunder to qualify as a reit  unless  because of changes in circumstances or changes in the code or regulations thereunder  the board of directors determines that it is no longer in the best interests of the company to qualify as a reit 
as such  it generally will not pay federal income taxes on the portion of its income which is distributed to shareholders

following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity and capital resources of the company  which should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  totaled  increasing million over revenues 
the revenue growth stems primarily from additional investments during and a partial year of revenues from investments provided revenue increases of approximately million  while a full year of revenues from investments added million to revenues 
revenues for also include million from assets classified as other real estate   from prepayment penalties on mortgage payoffs and approximately million of the revenue growth which stems from participating incremental revenues which became effective during a million decrease in revenues resulted from the early payoff of mortgages  disposition of real estate and the designation of assets as held for sale 
real estate investments of million as of december  will provide annualized revenues of million  which reflects no revenues from assets designated as other real estate or as held for sale 
revenues from the investment portfolio will continue at this level until additional investments are made  if any  and additional escalation provisions commence in annualized revenues for represent a million decrease from the annualized revenues of million based on real estate investments of million as of january  expenses for the year ended december  totaled  increasing approximately million over expenses of million for the provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled  increasing million over this increase stems from a full year provision for investments  plus a partial year provision for investments 
interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared with million for the increase in is primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings during the period offset by lower average interest rates 
general and administrative expenses for totaled  or approximately of revenues as compared to for no provision for federal income taxes has been made since the company intends to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the provisions of sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  the company will not be subject to federal income taxes on amounts distributed to shareholders  provided it distributes at least of its real estate investment trust taxable income and meets certain other conditions 
funds from operations ffo for the year ended december  totaled  an increase of million over the million for ffo is net earnings available to common shareholders  excluding any gains or losses from debt restructuring and the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation and amortization associated with real estate investments and charges to earnings for non cash common stock based compensation 
the increase in cash flow is primarily due to new additions to investments  offset by early payment of mortgages and disposition of real estate assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  totaled  increasing million over revenues 
the revenue growth stems primarily from additional investments during and a partial year of revenues from investments provided revenue increases of approximately million  while a full year of revenues from investments added million to revenues 
additionally  approximately million of the revenue growth stems from participating incremental revenues which became effective during real estate investments of million as of december  will provide annualized revenues of million  which reflects no additional revenues for assets held for sale 
revenues will continue at this level until additional investments are made and additional escalation provisions commence in annualized revenues for  excluding assets held for sale  represent a million increase over the annualized revenues of million based on real estate investments of million as of january  expenses for the year ended december  totaled  increasing approximately million over expenses of million for the provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled  increasing million over this increase stems from a full year provision for investments  plus a partial year provision for investments 
interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared with million for the increase in is primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings during the periods  offset partially by interest rate savings from conversions of subordinated debentures and reduced spreads on line of credit borrowings 
general and administrative expenses for totaled  or approximately of revenues as compared to for the percentage decrease stems primarily from economies of scale resulting from additional investments made in no provision for federal income taxes has been made since the company intends to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the provisions of sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  the company will not be subject to federal income taxes on amounts distributed to shareholders  provided it distributes at least of its real estate investment trust taxable income and meets certain other conditions 
funds from operations ffo for the year ended december  totaled  an increase of million over the million for ffo is net earnings available to common shareholders  excluding any gains or losses from debt restructuring and the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation and amortization associated with real estate investments and charges to earnings for non cash common stock based compensation 
the growth in cash flow is primarily due to net additions to investments in and liquidity and capital resources the company expects to continue to seek new investments in healthcare properties  primarily long term care facilities  with the objective of profitable growth and further diversification of the investment portfolio 
permanent financing for future investments is expected to be provided through a combination of private and public offerings of debt and equity securities 
at december   the company has total assets of billion  shareholders equity of million  and long term debt of million  representing approximately of total capitalization 
long term debt excludes funds borrowed under its acquisition credit agreements 
the company has million available under its revolving credit facilities  of which million was drawn at year end 
proceeds from asset sales and mortgage payments are expected to reduce borrowings on the credit facility by approximately million during the company has approximately million of indebtedness that matures july  and the term of its revolving credit facility expires september  the company intends to extend the maturity of its revolving credit facility and to refinance the term indebtedness  and may fix debt represented by the revolving credit facility and liquidate assets to pay such indebtedness or implement a plan which includes a combination of the foregoing 
management believes the company s liquidity and various sources of available capital are adequate to finance operations  meet debt service requirements and fund future investments 
on january   the company s form s registration statement permitting the issuance of up to million related to common stock  unspecified debt  preferred stock and convertible securities was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
the company distributes a large portion of the cash available from operations 
the company s historical policy has been to make distributions on common stock of approximately of ffo 
cash dividends paid totaled per share for  compared with per share for the year ended december  the dividend payout ratio  that is the ratio of per share amounts for dividends paid to the diluted per share amounts of funds from operations  was approximately for and the company believes that cash provided from quarterly operating activities at current levels will continue to be sufficient to fund normal working capital requirements and common stock dividends 
new investments generally are funded from temporary borrowings under the company s acquisition credit line agreements 
interest cost incurred by the company on borrowings under the revolving credit line facilities will vary depending upon fluctuations in prime and or libor rates 
with respect to the unsecured acquisition credit line  interest rates depend in part upon changes in the company s ratings by national agencies 
the term of the million unsecured facility expires on september  borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor plus or  at the company s option  at the prime rate 
borrowings under the million facility bear interest at libor plus or  at the company s option  at the prime rate 
the company expects to periodically replace funds drawn on the revolving credit facilities through fixed rate long term borrowings  the placement of convertible debentures  or the issuance of additional shares of common and or preferred stock 
historically  the company s strategy has been to match the maturity of its indebtedness with the maturity of its assets and to employ fixed rate long term debt to the extent practicable 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company seeks to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the market value of the company s long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages are subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term borrowings at december  was million 
a increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the company s total mortgages portfolio at december  was million 
a increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the mortgage portfolio by approximately million 
the company is subject to risks associated with debt or preferred equity financing  including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness 
if the company were unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms  it might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to the company and might adversely affect the cash available for distribution to shareholders 
if interest rates or other factors at the time of the refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the company s interest expense would increase  which might affect the company s ability to make common stock distributions to its shareholders 
the majority of the company s borrowings were completed pursuant to indentures which limit the amount of indebtedness the company may incur 
accordingly  in the event that the company is unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations  the company s ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 
if the company is unable to acquire additional properties  its ability to increase the distributions with respect to common shares  as it has done in the past  will be limited to management s ability to increase funds from operations  and thereby cash available for distribution  from the existing properties in the company s portfolio 
year compliance the company is not aware of any significant adverse effects of year on its systems and operations
