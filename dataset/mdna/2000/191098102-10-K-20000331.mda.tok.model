item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in the company s financial instruments  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
borrowings under informal lines of credit and other variable rate long term debt do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings either have maturities of less than three months or have variable interest rates 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates decline and  the fair market value of the company s debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is generally managed by borrowing funds with a variable interest rate or using interest rate swaps to effectively change fixed interest rate borrowings to variable interest rate borrowings 
the company generally maintains between and of total borrowings at variable interest rates  after taking into account all of the interest rate hedging activities 
as it relates to the company s variable rate debt  if market interest rates average more in than the rates of january   interest expense for would increase by million 
if market interest rates had averaged more in than the rates at january   interest expense for would have increased by million 
these amounts were determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on our variable rate debt  after giving consideration to all our interest rate hedging activities 
this sensitivity analysis does not assume changes in the company s financial structure 
the company is subject to commodity price risk arising from price movements for certain commodities included as part of its raw materials 
the company generally manages this risk by entering into long term contracts with adjustable prices 
the company has not used derivative commodity instruments in the management of this risk
