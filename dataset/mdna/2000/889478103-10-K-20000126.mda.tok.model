capital resources and liquidity funding for the company s operations has been principally provided by cash flows from operations  unsecured bank borrowings and  from time to time  the public debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  has improved as operating results have improved 
the company anticipates that the cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  will continue to improve as a result of an increase in revenues from the delivery of homes from its existing backlog as well as from new sales contracts and from land sales 
the company has used the cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and public debt to acquire additional land for new communities  to fund additional expenditures for land development and construction costs needed to meet the requirements of the increased backlog and continuing expansion of the number of communities in which the company is offering homes for sale  and to reduce debt

inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land  land development  construction and overhead costs  as well as in increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as in housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory  and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home
