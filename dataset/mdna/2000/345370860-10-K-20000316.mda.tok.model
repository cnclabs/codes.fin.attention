item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the improved fourth quarter results in europe reflect the non recurrence of s charge for employee separation costs  the addition of volvo car earnings and lower taxes  offset partially by lower volumes and market share for ford branded vehicles  primarily the ka  fiesta and mondeo 
the improvement in south america reflects primarily lower costs and the non recurrence of the charge for employee separation costs  offset partially by lower revenue

the increase in earnings reflects improved results in north america  offset partially by lower earnings in all other geographic markets 
adjusted for constant volume and mix  our total costs in the automotive sector declined billion compared with our automotive sector earnings in north america were  million in on sales of billion  compared with  million in on sales of billion 
the earnings improvement reflects primarily increased sales volume  an improved mix of light trucks and luxury cars  lower costs  and the non recurrence of s unusual items  offset partially by higher interest expense  lump sum payments related to the ratification of union contracts in  and costs related to employee separation programs in the after tax return on sales for our automotive sector in north america was in  up of a percentagepoint from in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in the united states  up from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  down of a percentage point 
the decrease in market share reflects primarily capacity constraints on several key products due to strong demand in the united states market 
our automotive sector earnings in europe were million in  a million reduction from a year ago 
the deterioration is explained by lower market share for ford branded vehicles  primarily mondeo and fiesta  and unfavorable vehicle mix  offset partially by the non recurrence of s employee separation costs  lower taxes  the impact of s unusual items  and the addition of volvo car 
in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in our fifteen primary european markets  up from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  up of a percentage point from a year ago 
the increase in our share is more than explained by the addition of volvo car 
our automotive sector in south america lost million in  compared with a loss of million in the decline in earnings reflects primarily lower industry sales  lower market share in brazil  weak economic conditions  devaluation of the brazilian currency  and increased competition  offset partially by lower costs and the non recurrence of s employee separation costs 
in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in brazil  compared with million in our share of those unit sales was in  down percentage points from a year ago 
in the fourth quarter of  our market share in brazil was  down of a percentage point 
these declines in market share reflect increased competition from new and existing manufacturers who are aggressively competing for the lower industry volume 
during december  ford completed the legal restructuring of its operations in brazil  which included the realignment of its operations and the retirement of us dollar debt 
based on business changes  events in  and the current business plan for ford in brazil  management has decided that a change in functional currency from the us dollar to the real is required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas for our automotive segment 
the real will be the primary currency of the environment in which ford brazil will operate 
this change  effective january   will result in a one time write down of ford brazil s fixed assets and inventories of million  which will be reflected in our first quarter other comprehensive income shown in our consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
visteon s brazilian operations will continue to use the us dollar as its functional currency 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued automotive sector earnings outside north america  europe and south america rest of world were million in  compared with earnings of million in the decline in earnings reflects primarily higher taxes and lower sales volume  offset partially by our share of the profit improvement at mazda and the non recurrence of a write off of our net exposure to kia motors company in new car and truck sales in australia  our largest market in rest of world  were approximately  units in  down percentage points from a year ago 
in  our combined car and truck market share in australia was  up of a percentage point from our visteon operations  included in our automotive sector  earned million on revenues of  million in  compared with million on revenues of  million in this earnings improvement reflects primarily cost reductions  the consolidation of halla climate control  and increased north american truck volume  offset partially by negotiated price reductions  compensation factors  and foreign currency translation 
visteon s after tax return on sales in was  unchanged from a year ago 
we and visteon are close to completing a market pricing review begun in of various carry over components and systems we purchase from visteon 
when the review is completed and a final pricing level is agreed to  it is expected that visteon will reduce prices to us 
compared with our automotive sector earnings in north america were  million in on sales of billion  compared with  million in on sales of billion 
the increase reflects primarily continued cost reductions and improved vehicle mix  offset partially by lower volumes and higher marketing costs 
the after tax return on sales for our automotive sector in north america was in  up of a percentage point from in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in the united states  up from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  down of a percentage point  more than explained by the discontinuation of low margin vehicle lines 
our automotive sector earnings in europe were million in  million worse than in the deterioration reflected higher restructuring costs  lower export sales  and costs associated with the focus car line launch  offset partially by cost reductions 
in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in our fifteen primary european markets  up from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  down percentage points from the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of  our market share in europe was  down percentage points 
our market share declined because of intense competitive conditions in europe and limited availability of our new focus car line during its launch 
our automotive sector in south america lost million in  compared with a profit of million in the decline was the result of lower volume and revenue resulting from weak economic conditions and charges we incurred for employee reductions  offset partially by lower costs 
we reduced production in brazil and argentina in the fourth quarter because of anticipated weaker demand in those markets in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in brazil  compared with million in our share of those unit sales was in  down percentage points from in the fourth quarter of  our market share in brazil declined to  down percentage points 
these declines in market share reflect new product entries from other manufacturers and an increasingly competitive market 
automotive sector earnings in rest of world were million in  up million from the improvement in earnings reflects primarily foreign tax credits and our share of the profit improvement at mazda  offset partially by a write off of our net exposure to kia motors company in new car and truck sales in australia were approximately  units in  up percentage points from in  our combined car and truck market share in australia was  down percentage points from our visteon operations  included in our automotive sector  earned million on revenues of  million in  compared with million on revenues of  million in this earnings improvement reflects primarily cost reductions and increased revenue for customer driven design changes 
visteon s after tax return on sales in was  up of a percentage point compared with the prior year 
financial services sector results of operations details of our full year financial services sector earnings for   and are shown below in millions full year net income loss ford credit    hertz gain on sale of common stock of hertz minority interests  eliminations  and other financial services excluding the associates    the associates net of minority interest gain on spin off of the associates  total financial services sector    memo ford s share of earnings in hertz through march  compared with earnings of our financial services sector consist primarily of two segments  ford credit and hertz 
ford credit s consolidated net income in was  million  up million or from compared with  the increase in full year earnings reflects primarily higher financing volumes and improved credit loss performance  offset partially by higher operating costs 
higher operating costs reflect primarily operating costs of recent acquisitions  costs associated with the restructuring of financing operations  and employee separation programs 
earnings at hertz in were million of which million was ford s share 
in  hertz had earnings of million of which million was ford s share 
the increase in earnings reflects primarily strong demand and continuing cost efficiency improvements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared with in we spun off the associates to our shareholders  resulting in a  million gain to ford 
for details of the spin off see note page fs of our notes to financial statements 
ford credit s consolidated net income in was  million  up million or from compared with  the increase in full year earnings reflects primarily improved credit loss performance  higher gains on receivable sales  lower effective tax rates  and higher financing volumes  offset partially by lower net financing margins and higher operating costs 
lower financing margins reflect higher depreciation expense for leased vehicles as a result of lower than anticipated residual values and higher residual reserves 
earnings at hertz in were million of which million was ford s share 
in  hertz had earnings of million of which million was ford s share 
the increase in earnings reflects primarily higher revenues and improved profit margins in worldwide car rental operations 
liquidity and capital resources automotive sector at december   our automotive sector had billion of cash and marketable securities 
despite cash outflows of billion for acquisitions and billion in cash dividends  our cash and marketable securities only decreased by million from december  in  we spent billion for capital goods  such as machinery  equipment  tooling and facilities  used in our automotive sector 
this is down million from capital expenditures were of sales in  down one percentage point from a year ago 
at december   our automotive sector had total debt of billion 
this amount was of our total capitalization that is  the sum of our stockholders equity and automotive debt at the end of  compared with of total capitalization at year end financial services sector at december   our financial services sector had cash and marketable securities totaling billion  up million from december  finance receivables and net investment in operating leases were billion at december   up billion from december  total debt was billion at december   up billion from december  outstanding commercial paper at december  totaled billion at ford credit including billion owed to ford  and billion at hertz  with an average remaining maturity of days and days  respectively 
for a discussion of the credit and other financial support facilities for our automotive and financial services sectors at december   see note page fs of our notes to financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year date conversion as of december   all critical business systems had been remediated and tested to ensure their ability to process the year date change yk 
the remediation and testing program s scope included other impact areas as well  including suppliers  plant floor equipment  affiliates  dealers  product development test equipment  technical infrastructure  physical infrastructure  vehicle components  and end user computing 
we entered into the year smoothly and without disruption to the business due to yk 
we did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in our operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since the date change  we do not expect any significant impact to our business as a result of yk 
reports from our suppliers regarding yk have exceeded expectations and have been uniformly positive 
our business systems and technical infrastructure are processing normally 
we estimate our total cost for yk compliance efforts will be about million  which we will have incurred over about a three year period that commenced mid yk compliance costs incurred through december  were about million 
our annual yk costs relating to information technology have represented and are expected through year end to represent about of our total annual information technology budget 
euro conversion the increased price transparency that may result from the use of a single currency in the eleven participating countries that have adopted the euro as their common legal currency could affect the ability of ford and other companies to price their products differently in the various european markets 
a possible result of this is price harmonization at lower average prices for products sold in some markets 
nevertheless  differences in national value added tax regimes  national vehicle registration taxes  customer preferences for equipment and options  sizes and types of vehicles and engines  and trade in values may reduce the potential for price harmonization 
in the year since the euro s introduction  it is uncertain what affect  if any  the euro has had on the pricing of automobiles 
other factors  such as intense competition in the european markets and consumer preferences  also affect how our vehicles are priced 
it is impossible to determine how the introduction of the euro has impacted pricing relative to these other factors 
introduction of the euro may reduce the amount of ford s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  due to the netting effect of having imports and exports denominated in a single currency as opposed to the various legacy currencies 
as a result  the complexity of our foreign exchange hedging has been reduced 
conversely  because there will be less diversity in our exposure to foreign currencies  movements in the euro s value could have a more pronounced effect  whether positive or negative  on ford 
we have budgeted up to million including contingencies for the period from through to cover the worldwide costs of preparing for and making operational changes to accommodate introduction of the euro 
certain of our business functions introduced euro capability as of january   including  for example  systems for making and receiving certain payments  pricing and invoicing 
other business functions will be converted for the euro by the end of the transition period december   but may be converted earlier where operationally efficient or cost effective  or to meet customer needs 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued new accounting standards and changes new standards in the first quarter of  we adopted statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this sop requires entities to capitalize certain internal use software costs once certain criteria are met 
our practice has been to expense the costs of obtaining or developing internal use software as incurred 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on earnings 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated specifically as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment referred to as a fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a forecasted transaction 
we anticipate having each of these types of hedges  and we will comply with the requirements of sfas when we adopt it 
we expect to adopt sfas beginning january  we have not yet determined the effect of adopting sfas accounting changes beginning in  we changed from an accelerated method to the units of production method for special tooling amortization 
this change was made to recognize that special tooling retains its value more uniformly over time and more closely aligns tooling amortization with vehicle production volumes  providing a better matching of costs and revenues 
also beginning in  we modified our plant and equipment retirement policy to reflect gains and losses in income in the year of retirement 
previously  the cost of retired assets  net of salvage proceeds  was charged to accumulated depreciation 
the change in accounting principle for plant and equipment retirement was made to better reflect the results of asset disposal sale decisions 
adoption of these changes did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued outlook industry sales volumes our outlook for car and truck including heavy trucks industry sales in in our major markets is as follows united states approximately million units  compared with the million units sold in europe approximately million units  compared with the million units sold in both figures based on markets brazil between and million units  compared with the million units sold in australia slightly lower than the  units sold in financial milestones we have set and communicated certain financial milestones for while we hope to achieve these goals  they should not be interpreted as projections  expectations or forecasts of results 
the financial milestones for are as follows full year milestone total company o total shareholder returns top quartile of s p over time o revenue grow billion automotive sector o north america record earnings o europe improve results o south america improve results o rest of world improve results o total costs reduce billion at constant volume and mix o capital spending billion o visteon achieve independence financial services sector o ford credit grow earnings improve returns o hertz record earnings ninth consecutive year of increased earnings item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated  including  without limitation greater price competition in the us and europe resulting from currency fluctuations  industry overcapacity or other factors  a significant decline in industry sales  particularly in the us or europe  resulting from slowing economic growth  currency or commodity price fluctuations  further economic difficulties in south america or asia  higher fuel prices  a market shift from truck sales in the us  lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles  labor or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business  increased safety or emissions regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions  work stoppages at key ford or supplier facilities  and the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in recall campaigns  increased warranty costs or litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ford is exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
o to ensure funding over business and economic cycles and to minimize overall borrowing costs  our financial services sector issues debt and other payables with various maturity and interest rate structures 
the maturity and interest rate structures frequently differ from the invested assets 
exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are created by the difference in the interest rate structure of assets and liabilities 
o our automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in subsidiaries 
these expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
o we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector 
we monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results 
the effect of changes in exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as unit sales and operating margins 
for more information on these financial exposures  see note pages fs and fs and note page fs of our notes to financial statements 
our interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity risk are quantified below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps including those with a currency swap component primarily at ford credit to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on earnings by changing the characteristics of assets and liabilities to match each other 
all interest rate swap agreements are designated to hedge either a specific balance sheet item or pool of items 
we use a model to assess the sensitivity of our earnings to changes in market interest rates 
the model recalculates earnings by adjusting rates associated with variable rate instruments on the repricing date and by adjusting rates on fixed rate instruments scheduled to mature in the subsequent twelve months  effective on their scheduled maturity date 
interest income and interest expense are then recalculated based on the revised rates 
assuming an instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial instruments and leased assets  our after tax earnings would change by million over a month period 
foreign currency risk we use derivative financial instruments to hedge assets  liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging policy is defensive  based on clearly defined guidelines 
speculative actions are not permitted 
we do not use complex derivative instruments such as interest only or principal only derivatives 
we use a value at risk var analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary assumptions used in the var analysis are as follows o a monte carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments forwards and options and all significant underlying exposures 
the var includes an month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period 
o the var analysis calculates the potential risk  within a confidence level  on firm commitment exposures cash flows  including the effects of foreign currency derivatives 
translation exposures are not included in the var analysis 
the monte carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios which have a lognormal distribution 
o estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the jp morgan riskmetricstm datasets 
based on our overall currency exposure including derivative positions during  the risk during to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average less than million  with a high of million and a low of million 
at december   currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next months by less than million  within a confidence level 
compared with our projection at december   the var amount is approximately million lower  primarily because of significantly reduced currency exchange rate volatility and higher levels of hedging  partially offset by the inclusion of volvo currency exposures and hedges 
commodity price risk ford enters into commodity forward and option contracts 
such contracts are executed to offset ford s exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components 
the fair value liability of such contracts  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december and was approximately and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts  assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities
