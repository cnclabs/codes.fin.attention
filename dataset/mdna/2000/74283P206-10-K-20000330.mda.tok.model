item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data 
prodigy is a leading national internet service provider 
in october  prodigy launched prodigy internet  an open standards based internet access service 
since the autumn of  prodigy has focused on expanding the prodigy internet subscriber base and introducing additional value added services 
prodigy has also made strategic decisions to outsource its network and use multiple vendors for outsourced customer services functions 
as a result of these initiatives  prodigy has substantially reduced its fixed operating costs and headcount 
in conjunction with the launch of prodigy internet in october  prodigy began offering a plan allowing subscribers unlimited usage of prodigy internet for a flat monthly fee without hourly usage charges 
in december  prodigy introduced a similar plan for prodigy classic 
since the introduction of prodigy s unlimited usage plans  the portion of revenues generated from hourly usage charges has decreased substantially 
the results of operations of internet service providers  including those of prodigy  are significantly affected by subscriber cancellations 
subscriber acquisition expenses and the administrative expenses of enrolling and assisting new subscribers are substantial  and in the past prodigy typically offered free service for one or two months to new subscribers 
in selected distribution channels  prodigy has replaced free trial programs with prepaid term plans and subscriber contract acquisition programs in order to attract enrollees who are less likely to terminate service 
prodigy historically has experienced better retention for subscribers under prepaid term plans than subscribers under month to month plans 
under prepaid term plans  subscribers choose to prepay for longer terms at reduced monthly rates 
additionally  under subscriber contract acquisition programs  prodigy makes payments to computer retailers in return for  among other things  the retailers enrolling a customer onto prodigy internet  obtaining a signed contractual commitment from the customer to a term subscription of one  two or three years  and committed marketing of prodigy internet by the retailer in connection with the retailers other product advertisements 
prodigy s recent experience has been that subscribers obtained through subscriber contract acquisition programs have lower rates of cancellation than those obtained through other channels 
as a result of these lower rates of cancellation  prodigy has made the strategic decision to focus its marketing efforts towards these subscriber acquisition programs 
prodigy historically has experienced seasonality in its business  with 
higher expense during the last and first fiscal quarters  corresponding to the christmas and post christmas selling season  and 
lower timed usage revenues revenues from hourly usage charges during its second and third fiscal quarters resulting from reduced usage of its services during the summer months 
prodigy believes that the seasonal reductions in timed usage revenues historically experienced by prodigy will be mitigated by the movement from timed usage plans to unlimited usage plans as well as growth in prodigy s subscriber base  although prodigy expects to continue to have higher expenses during its first and fourth quarters 
due to the seasonality of its business  as well as to other factors  prodigy experiences quarterly fluctuations in its operating results 
on october   prodigy acquired the bizonthe 
net web hosting business of us republic communications  inc  an indirect majority owned subsidiary of vartec  including the subscribers of the bizonthe 
net web hosting business 
in consideration for bizonthe 
net  prodigy repaid a million loan from vartec to us republic and issued  shares of prodigy common stock to us republic including  shares held in an escrow account to secure the indemnification obligations of us republic and its shareholders 
some or all of the escrowed shares will be released to us republic at various times over the two year period following the closing 
in addition to the shares and amounts paid at closing  in prodigy may be required to issue up to  additional shares  contingent on the attainment by the acquired business of set earn out targets 
based on the value of the  shares of common stock currently issued in connection with the bizonthe 
net acquisition and the million cash used to repay the loan  the total purchase price is approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million has been allocated to goodwill and will be amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
results of operations prodigy s total revenues have two components internet and online service revenues  consisting of subscription revenues from subscribers to prodigy internet and prodigy classic  and other revenues  consisting of small business web hosting fees from prodigy s prodigybiz division  fees from a management contract with telmex under which prodigy provides certain management and consulting services to telmex s internet subsidiary prodigy internet de telmex  and advertising and transaction fees 
subscription revenues include revenues from hourly usage charges timed usage revenues 
prodigy defines billable subscribers as subscribers who remain enrolled beyond completion of the applicable trial period or who enroll in a money back guarantee program 
prodigy defines internet subscribers managed to include billable prodigy internet subscribers and billable prodigy internet de telmex subscribers but excluding subscribers to the prodigy classic service which was discontinued in year ended december  compared to year ended december  subscribers the number of prodigy internet billable subscribers increased  or  from  billable subscribers at december  to  at december  prodigy classic subscribers decreased from  at december  to  on october   the date prodigy classic was discontinued  and zero thereafter 
total internet subscribers managed increased by  or  from  at december  to  at december  billable subscribers of prodigy internet de telmex accounted for approximately  of the number of internet subscribers managed at december internet revenues subscription revenues from prodigy internet increased million  or  from million in to million in due to the increase in billable subscribers discussed above 
subscription revenues from prodigy classic decreased million  or  from million in to million in due to the discontinuation of service as of october timed usage revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in timed usage revenues was primarily attributable to the decrease in prodigy classic subscribers during other revenues other revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in other revenues consisted of million in management fees relating to prodigy s january agreement with telmex to manage the prodigy internet de telmex internet subscribers  million from prodigy s web hosting business including revenues from bizonthe 
net  which was acquired in october  million attributable to transition services revenue related to prodigy s july acquisition of internet subscribers of cable wireless usa  inc  and a million increase in advertising display revenues primarily due to prodigy s successful program of re establishing control over advertising content displayed on prodigy internet s home page 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease of million from prodigy s african internet operations that were sold in october cost of revenues cost of revenues includes network and content expenses 
network expense includes costs associated with prodigy s hosting operations center in yorktown  new york as well as the costs of outsourced network provider services 
content expenses consist of the costs of developing  or obtaining from third parties  content for inclusion in prodigy s service offerings 
cost of revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in primarily related to increased network charges incurred by prodigy in network usage increased in compared to primarily due to the shift of the subscriber base from timed usage to unlimited usage plans which result in higher hourly usage 
however  network expense increased only or due to a monthly cap based on average hourly usage by subscribers contained in the network agreement between prodigy and splitrock 
the increase in network charges was offset  in part  by a decrease of million  or  in content expense attributable to the discontinuation of the prodigy classic service 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense includes the costs to acquire and retain subscribers  advertising and other general sales and marketing costs 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  from million in to million in 
the increase in marketing costs was primarily attributable to an increase of million in production  media and other costs associated with prodigy s there is a choice and are you a prodigy advertising campaigns that appeared during in early  prodigy postponed certain of its marketing programs in response to network performance issues encountered during the transition period accompanying the initial rollout of the splitrock network 
additionally  prodigy spent million in establishing prodigy s business solutions division and marketing its product offerings and million in marketing prodigy s hispanic internet offering 
sales and marketing expense also reflects increased bad debt provisions of million in connection with the pending recovery of defaulted subscriber contracts 
product development product development expense includes research and development costs and other product development costs 
product development expense increased million  or  from million in to million in product development activities in centered on implementing the billing  provisioning and customer service infrastructure to support prodigy s small business web hosting business  improving the system infrastructure supporting the prodigy internet de telmex subscriber base  including year remediation efforts  developing a new home page for prodigy internet and developing future prodigy internet product offerings and service enhancements 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to substantially higher customer service charges incurred in connection with the increase of billable prodigy internet subscribers achieved in the year  especially the heavy volume of enrollments emanating from the contract subscriber acquisition program during the second half of this increase primarily reflected a million increase in customer service charges  a million increase in number charges  and a million increase in billing and credit card interchange fees 
general and administrative expense also increased in due to increased charges for accounting and legal fees  recruiting  office temporary workers and compensation expense resulting from the issuance of stock options priced below market 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to million of goodwill  tradename and other intangibles amortization incurred in connection with the bizonthe 
net acquisition 
in addition  the period reflects depreciation attributable to a new accounting system as well as subscriber management software implemented during amortization of subscriber acquisition costs during prodigy entered into agreements with several national retailers of personal computers for the purpose of stimulating prodigy internet enrollments 
under these agreements prodigy made payments to the retailers in exchange for the retailers enrolling a customer onto prodigy internet  obtaining a signed contractual commitment from the customer to a term subscription of one  two or three years  and committed marketing of prodigy internet by the retailer in connection with the retailers other product advertisements 
these payments amounted to   or  respectively  for a term subscription of one  two or three years at prodigy s standard monthly rates 
prodigy has accounted for these payments  and the purchase price paid for the acquired cable wireless subscribers that migrated to prodigy internet  as subscriber acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the underlying subscriber contract or months  respectively 
during  prodigy incurred amortization of subscriber acquisition costs of million consisting of million related to the subscriber acquisition contracts and million related to the acquired cable wireless subscribers 
interest and other income interest income  increased million  from million in to million in the increase is primarily due to the investment of the cash proceeds of prodigy s initial public offering in february in short term money market instruments 
these increases were offset by interest expense of million incurred to service notes payable during during the year ended december   prodigy recognized a gain of million upon the sale of an equity investment 
in addition  prodigy recognized a gain of million when it paid 
million in full settlement of a promissory note in the principal amount of million plus all accrued interest 
income taxes prodigy has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing on the realizability of its deferred tax assets  which are comprised principally of net operating loss carry forwards 
under the applicable accounting standards  prodigy has considered its history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that prodigy will not realize these favorable tax attributes 
accordingly  the related deferred tax assets have been fully reserved 
as a result of the foregoing factors  prodigy s operating loss increased million  or  from million in to million in and its net loss increased million  or  from million in to million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue subscription revenues from prodigy internet increased million  or  from million in to million in the number of prodigy internet billable subscribers increased  or  from  at december  to  billable subscribers at december   representing and of total billable subscribers at december  and december   respectively  prodigy internet subscribers accounted for and of total network usage during and  respectively

other revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in primarily due to increased sales by prodigy s african internet operations which were sold on october  for the years and  the other revenues derived from prodigy s former international operations consisted primarily of fees for internet access and online services provided primarily to businesses in africa and china

this increase was offset in part by a reduction in content expense  which declined as a result of the renegotiation and or termination of content contracts associated with prodigy classic and prodigy s content outsourcing agreement with excite 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the period reflected spending related to the launch of prodigy internet in october which continued through the post christmas selling season 
in addition  in early  prodigy temporarily deferred sales and marketing programs in response to network performance issues encountered during the transition period accompanying the initial roll out of the new splitrock network 
product development product development expense decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
million  or 
during  product development efforts were primarily focused on stabilization and enhancement of prodigy internet and on migration of prodigy classic content to the prodigy internet platform 
as a result of the completion of these activities in  product development activities and spending were subsequently reduced

million loss on the sale of its african cellular telephone operations

commencing in july through the end of the year prodigy paid approximately million in consideration for subscribers obtained through its subscriber contract acquisition programs 
at december   prodigy had capitalized related subscriber contract acquisition costs of million and had recognized amortization expense of million 
prodigy has million accrued related to these programs as of december  in february  prodigy entered into a similar program with another retailer 
total amounts to be paid under this program will depend on the number of subscriber contracts received and could be material 
prodigy s capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  primarily for the purchase of data processing equipment  compared to capital expenditures of million in prodigy anticipates that its capital expenditures will be approximately million in net cash from financing activities in and and future financing requirements are discussed in the following paragraphs

in august  telmex purchased  shares of common stock from prodigy for gross proceeds of million  and in july carso global telecom purchased  shares of common stock from prodigy for gross proceeds of million 
prodigy used a portion of the proceeds to repay amounts owed to banco inbursa and bank of america in the aggregate amount of million

at december   the line of credit had been paid down to million 
prodigy repaid million of these notes in january and the remaining million is due on april  at december   prodigy had available cash and cash equivalents of million million at february  
prodigy is currently experiencing substantial negative cash flow each month and expects to continue to experience negative cash flows through telmex has committed to provide financing of up to million to fund prodigy s operations through february management believes that this additional funding will be sufficient to enable prodigy to meet its planned expenditures through at least december  prodigy s future financing requirements will depend on a number of factors  including prodigy s operating performance and increases in operating expenses associated with growth in prodigy s business 
based upon its current operating plan  prodigy believes that it will require significant external financing in order to continue to expand its consumer business 
prodigy is considering a number of alternatives to raise additional financing  including public or private equity or debt financing  bank loans  strategic partner and joint venture arrangements  vendor financing  leasing arrangements or a combination of these sources 
there can be no assurance that prodigy will be able to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms

prodigy has incurred significant losses and may incur losses in the future 
if prodigy does not achieve and sustain profitability  prodigy s financial condition and stock price could decline 
since inception  prodigy has incurred significant losses 
prodigy cannot assure that it will achieve or sustain profitability 
the following table shows prodigy s revenues and net losses during the three years ended december   and year ended december  revenues million million million net losses million million million at december   prodigy had 
an accumulated deficit of million  
a working capital deficit of million  
current liabilities of million  and 
current assets of million 
since formation  prodigy has not generated positive cash flow from operations and has relied on private and public sales of equity securities and borrowings to fund its operations 
the following table shows prodigy s negative cash flows from operations during the last three years 
year ended december  negative cash flows from operations million million million prior to its acquisition by prodigy on june   prodigy s predecessor incurred significant net losses and sustained negative cash flow from operations that required continued funding by the predecessor s former owners  ibm and sears 
the funding totaled billion as of june  prodigy operates in a highly competitive market and faces significant competition from a variety of current and potential sources 
prodigy may fail to compete effectively in its market 
prodigy s industry is intensely competitive and includes many significant participants  including 
internet service providers  
proprietary online service providers  
major international telecommunications companies  
internet search services  and 
various other telecommunications companies 
prodigy also faces competition from companies that provide broadband service to households  including 
local and long distance telephone companies  
cable television companies  and 
electric utility companies 
among the larger internet service providers that prodigy competes with are earthlink  which has merged with mindspring  microsoft network  at t worldnet  mci internet  ibm internet connection  psinet  gte internetworking  and concentric network corporation 
microsoft s ownership of the dominant pc operating system and the microsoft internet explorer browser may give microsoft network competitive advantages  including distribution and marketing synergies 
prodigy also competes with america online  which offers the america online and compuserve proprietary online services over closed networks and internet access 
broadband technologies offer significantly faster internet access than conventional modems 
broadband companies could include internet access in their basic service packages  offer access for a nominal additional charge or prevent prodigy from delivering internet access through the cable or wire connections that these companies own 
the federal telecommunications act of contains provisions that remove  or establish procedures for removing  restrictions on regional bell operating companies and others that may permit them to engage directly in the internet access business 
this act also makes it possible for national long distance carriers  such as at t  to offer local telephone service  which would permit these carriers to offer direct local internet access 
the federal telecommunications act and strategic alliances or consolidation among internet service providers may result in additional competitive pressures 
many of prodigy s current and future competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than prodigy 
increased competition could also adversely affect prodigy s ability to develop new service offerings and interfere with prodigy s efforts to maintain or grow its subscriber base 
prodigy cannot assure it will compete effectively 
increasing competition could have a material adverse effect on prodigy s future revenues and liquidity 
prodigy may be subject to increasing pricing pressures  which could result in lower revenues 
the introduction of free service and unlimited usage plans and the elimination of most hourly access charges by internet service providers  as well as increasing competition in prodigy s industry  have placed pressure on prodigy s revenues and profit margins 
because of prodigy s historically low operating margins  any decrease in revenues or increase in marketing expenses would diminish the likelihood of prodigy becoming profitable 
subscriber cancellations are common in prodigy s industry and may adversely affect future revenues 
prodigy s industry is characterized by a high rate of customer turnover 
customer acquisition expenses and the administrative expenses of enrolling and assisting new subscribers are substantial 
the failure to attract and retain subscribers to prodigy s services  or an increase in or a failure to slow the rate of subscriber cancellations  would have a material adverse effect on prodigy s future revenues 
prodigy relies on splitrock s network 
splitrock s failure to provide network servicer as required could damage prodigy s business 
splitrock operates a telecommunications network to carry prodigy s subscriber traffic 
prodigy currently is splitrock s principal customer 
the failure by splitrock for any reason to provide network services as required  or any significant disruption in these services  whether for technical  operational or financial reasons  could adversely affect prodigy s service quality  reputation and customer base 
telecommunications networks are subject to security problems and other network failures 
the occurrence of a network problem could damage prodigy s business 
security problems represent an ongoing threat to telecommunications networks 
splitrock s network and prodigy s data hosting center are potentially vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions that could lead to service interruptions 
break ins could jeopardize the confidentiality of information stored or transmitted by prodigy s customers 
the security measures employed by splitrock and prodigy cannot assure complete protection from security problems 
the occurrence of these problems may result in claims against prodigy and could adversely affect it or its ability to attract and retain customers 
prodigy s operations are also dependent on the protection of splitrock s network and its data hosting center against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
technical problems and network failures can occur from time to time in the ordinary course of operating a telecommunications network 
prodigy s host configuration for prodigy internet is unique and  for cost reasons  has not been replicated off site 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems in splitrock s network or prodigy s data hosting center  or the failure of telecommunications providers to provide required data communications capacity due to a natural disaster or for any other reason  could cause interruptions in prodigy s services 
these service interruptions could adversely affect prodigy s competitive position and future revenues 
prodigy relies on third party providers  including local phone companies 
the inability or unwillingness of these companies to continue to provide telecommunications  customer service  billing and other services to prodigy could negatively affect prodigy s business 
in addition to its network arrangements with splitrock  prodigy has outsourced aspects of its content  customer service and billing functions to several providers 
outsourcing makes prodigy reliant on third party providers for critical functions 
the failure of these providers to provide services as required  or any significant disruption of or deterioration in services  could require prodigy to obtain alternative affiliates at a higher cost and result in customer cancellations 
prodigy also relies on local telephone and other companies to provide data communications capacity via local telecommunications lines and leased long distance lines 
the federal telecommunications act of is expected to lead to increased competition in the provision of local and other telephone service 
however  prodigy cannot predict the timing or extent of any developments or their effect on pricing or supply 
prodigy s suppliers and telecommunications carriers also sell or lease products and services to its competitors and possibly current or future competitors 
prodigy s suppliers and telecommunications carriers could enter into exclusive arrangements with its competitors or stop selling or leasing their products or services to prodigy at commercially reasonable prices or at all 
two significant shareholders currently control prodigy 
these shareholders can determine the outcome of all matters submitted to shareholders irrespective of the votes of other shareholders 
if carso global telecom and telmex act together  they can currently determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of prodigy shareholders  including the election of all members of prodigy s board of directors 
accordingly  carso global telecom and telmex can control the management and affairs of prodigy 
the voting control of carso global telecom and telmex could be used as a means or have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or acquisition of prodigy 
carlos slim helu and members of his immediate family beneficially own a majority of the voting equity securities of carso global telecom 
carso global telecom may be deemed to control telmex through the shares of telmex that it owns directly and indirectly 
mr 
slim is also chairman of the board of carso global telecom and telmex 
thus  mr 
slim and members of his immediate family may be deemed to control carso global telecom  telmex and prodigy 
this common control means that carso global telecom and telmex acting together can determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of prodigy s stockholders 
carso global telecom  telmex and prodigy s directors may be subject to conflicts of interest 
circumstances may arise in which the interests of carso global telecom or telmex  as shareholders  could conflict with the interests of the other shareholders of prodigy 
carso global telecom and its affiliates have engaged in numerous transactions with prodigy in the past that were not necessarily a result of arms length negotiations 
for example  an affiliate of carso global telecom provides prodigy with a  revolving line of credit  and telmex has committed to provide financing of up to  to fund prodigy s operations through february prodigy has outsourced its network operations to splitrock  a company that is owned by carso global telecom 
carso global telecom and its affiliates may engage in additional related party transactions with prodigy in the future  and there can be no assurance these transactions will be on arms length terms 
samer f 
salameh  prodigy s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  who formerly served on splitrock s board of directors  holds stock options to purchase shares of splitrock common stock 
mr 
salameh also serves as an advisor to the chief executive officer of telmex 
in addition to mr 
salameh  alfredo sanchez  arturo elias and james m 
nakfoor  directors of prodigy  are affiliated with carso global telecom or telmex  and allen craft  an executive officer and director of prodigy  is employed by sbc 
mr 
salameh is married to mr 
slim s niece  and mr 
elias is married to mr 
slim s daughter 
the law requires prodigy s directors to make all decisions in accordance with their fiduciary duties and in the best interests of prodigy and its shareholders 
messrs 
salameh  elias  nakfoor and sanchez  directors of prodigy  owe similar duties to the other companies for which they serve as directors or officers or with which they are otherwise affiliated 
due to the nature of the potential conflicts of interest presented on an ongoing basis by these arrangements  and potential future arrangements  prodigy cannot assure that the directors involved have acted or will act in a manner that takes into account solely the interests of prodigy and its shareholders 
prodigy cannot fund its operations with the cash generated from its business 
additional financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and additional operating restrictions 
prodigy s future financing requirements will depend in part on its operating performance and increases in operating expenses associated with growth in its business 
prodigy is currently experiencing substantial negative cash flow each month and expects to continue to experience negative cash flow through prodigy has approximately  of cash available at february  telmex has committed to provide financing of up to  to fund prodigy s operations through february prodigy is in the process of seeking third party financing of approximately  secured by the future service fees payable by contract subscribers to the prodigy internet service 
in connection with this financing  prodigy has requested sbc to guarantee prodigy s ongoing performance obligations under its customer contracts 
prodigy and sbc are negotiating the terms under which sbc would agree to provide such a guarantee 
there can be no assurance that the parties will come to an agreement 
any additional equity financing may cause investors to experience dilution  and any additional debt financing may result in restrictions on prodigy s operations 
enrollments from pc bundling are declining 
if future enrollments from pc bundling are not fully replaced by enrollments from contract acquisition programs  prodigy s financial condition may decline 
a majority of prodigy internet enrollments historically have arisen from bundling arrangements with pc manufacturers 
in  of total enrollments to prodigy internet were obtained through pc bundling  including from prodigy s pc bundling relationship with packard bell nec 
in  the percentage of total enrollments to prodigy internet obtained through pc bundling declined to but the percentage obtained through contract acquisition programs  in which prodigy makes payments of up to to major pc retailers who enroll subscribers to term subscriptions of at least one year  increased from zero in to 
prodigy s contract acquisition program with best buy accounted for approximately of total enrollments during prodigy s contract acquisition program with best buy terminated on november   except in stores where the program is still in effect 
prodigy has other  less significant  contract acquisition programs with other retailers and entered into an additional contract acquisition program in february prodigy  however  cannot predict whether future contract acquisition programs will generate as many enrollments as in the past 
if prodigy subscriber base does not continue to increase at a rapid rate  its financial condition may decline 
if prodigy does not manage the integration of acquired companies successfully  it may not achieve the desired results of the acquisitions 
as a part of its business strategy  prodigy has completed several acquisitions to date and may enter into additional business combinations  acquisitions and strategic relationships 
these transactions are typically accompanied by risks similar to those posed by the sbc transaction 
prodigy may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with these potential business combinations and acquisitions potentially disrupting prodigy s business and causing increased losses 
risks associated with the pending sbc transaction prodigy and sbc have agreed to establish the strategic relationship described above under the caption pending transactions sbc in item of this report on form k 
completion of the sbc transaction is not a condition to completion of the flashnet merger  and the sbc transaction may not be completed 
if the sbc transaction is completed 
prodigy s network and operations may be unable to accommodate sbc s internet subscribers without disruptions in service  
prodigy will be subject to the restrictions imposed on bell operating company affiliates by the communications act  
the dilution to existing investors may adversely affect the price of prodigy s stock  
the change in ownership and management structure of prodigy following the sbc transaction could make it more difficult for prodigy to attract and retain key personnel and directors  and 
the price of prodigy s stock could decline if the effect of the sbc transaction on prodigy s subscriber base and financial results does not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts 
risks associated with the pending flashnet transaction prodigy has agreed to enter into a merger with flashnet communications described above under the caption pending transactions flashnet in item of this report on form k 
completion of the flashnet merger is not a condition to completion of the sbc transaction  and the flashnet merger may not be completed 
if the flashnet merger is completed 
prodigy may have difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of prodigy and flashnet  
flashnet customers may terminate service as a result of concerns over the merger  
the dilution to existing investors may adversely affect the price of prodigy s stock  and 
the price of prodigy s stock could decline if the perceived benefits of the merger do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts 
prodigy s expansion strategy depends on its ability to anticipate and adapt to new services and markets 
prodigy s business strategy includes the introduction of new services and entry into new markets 
prodigy may be unsuccessful in offering new services and entering new markets as planned 
prodigy s new services may not achieve market acceptance 
in particular  prodigy is 
expanding its web hosting activities and other internet based services  
expanding beyond its existing consumer market to include small and medium sized businesses  and 
targeting internet services to spanish speaking and hispanic customers in the united states 
prodigy historically has focused on the consumer market and has only limited experience in developing and marketing services in these markets 
prodigy is subject to seasonality which causes prodigy s quarterly results to fluctuate 
if prodigy s quarterly results fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of prodigy s stock will decline 
although prodigy s strategy of contracting with third parties to provide services such as network access  billing and customer service enables it to tie many variable costs to variable revenue sources  prodigy bases its fixed expenses  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
if revenues are below expectations  prodigy may be unable to reduce fixed costs proportionately  which may adversely effect its operating results 
prodigy experiences quarterly fluctuations in its operating results due to many factors  including 
pricing changes  
changes in the level of consumer spending during business cycles  
the timing of introduction of new and enhanced services by prodigy  and 
competitive factors 
in addition  prodigy historically has experienced seasonality in its business  with 
higher expenses during the last and first fiscal quarters  corresponding to the christmas and post christmas selling season 
lower timed usage revenues  meaning revenues from hourly usage charges  typically occurring during prodigy s second and third fiscal quarters resulting from reduced usage of its services during the summer months 
accordingly  prodigy believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
the failure to protect prodigy s proprietary technology adequately would adversely affect prodigy s competitive position 
failure to protect prodigy s proprietary technology could adversely affect its competitive position 
prodigy attempts to protect its proprietary technology through copyright and trade secrets laws  employee and third party confidentiality agreements and other methods 
prodigy grants customers a license to use its services under agreements that contain terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may be able to copy portions of prodigy s services or reverse engineer or obtain and use information prodigy regards as proprietary 
prodigy s business plan requires it to continue to grow its subscriber base 
if prodigy is unable to manage growth effectively  its business could be harmed 
prodigy s ability to exploit the market for its products and services and increase its subscriber base requires an effective planning and management process 
prodigy s ability to plan and manage effectively will require prodigy to continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems 
prodigy will also be required to attract and retain skilled managers and other personnel  including its current executive officers 
these challenges are exacerbated during periods of rapid growth 
for example  as prodigy increased the number of billable prodigy internet subscribers by from june  to december   network performance deteriorated and customer service costs increased 
prodigy anticipates that the network assets and resources to be acquired upon the consummation of the sbc transaction and the flashnet merger will alleviate the network performance deterioration which has accompanied the increase in prodigy s subscriber base 
the failure to close either the sbc transaction or the flashnet merger in a timely fashion or at all or the failure to integrate the network assets and resources acquired through the sbc transaction and the flashnet merger could adversely affect prodigy s network performance  service quality  reputation and customer base 
if prodigy is unable to attract and retain key personnel  its operations could be adversely affected 
competition for key personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that prodigy will be successful in attracting and retaining necessary personnel 
although prodigy has entered into non competition agreements with some executive officers  the agreements may not be enforceable 
prodigy does not maintain insurance on the lives of any of its officers or directors 
prodigy may not be able to complete proposed acquisitions  which could adversely affect prodigy s competitive position 
prodigy may be unable to identify  finance and complete acquisitions on acceptable terms 
the internet services industry is highly fragmented  consisting of more than  internet service providers in the united states  and is expected to undergo substantial consolidation over the next few years 
prodigy s failure to expand its business through acquisitions may materially adversely affect its competitive position 
prodigy depends on the continued use and expansion of the internet 
prodigy s business and revenues depend on the continued use and expansion of the internet 
only recently has the commercial sector begun significant use of the internet and  more recently still  have consumers begun using the internet 
use of the internet has grown dramatically  but prodigy cannot assure the continued use and expansion of the internet as a medium of communications and commerce 
a decrease in the demand for internet services or a reduction in the currently anticipated growth for internet services could adversely affect prodigy s future revenues and liquidity 
prodigy s attraction and retention of customers depends on its ability to anticipate and adapt to rapidly changing technology 
prodigy s industry is characterized by rapid technological change resulting in dynamic customer demands and frequent new product and service introductions 
as a result of these technological improvements  markets can change rapidly 
prodigy s future results will depend in part on its ability to make timely and cost effective enhancements and additions to its services 
for example  competitors have introduced  or announced plans to introduce  high speed internet access utilizing broadband technology through cable lines  integrated services digital network  or isdn  telephone service and digital subscriber line  or dsl  telephone service 
while prodigy offers high speed internet access through dsl  prodigy may not have sufficient resources to provide dsl access and to introduce new services that meet customer demands on a timely basis 
prodigy s new service introductions may not achieve market acceptance 
prodigy s ability to compete successfully is also dependent on the continued compatibility of its services with the technologies of others 
although prodigy intends to support emerging standards in the market for internet access  its products may not conform to new standards in a timely fashion 
services or technologies developed by others could render prodigy s services or technology noncompetitive or obsolete 
changes in government regulation  which are likely in rapidly evolving internet related industries  could adversely affect prodigy s business 
internet access and online services are not subject to direct regulation in the united states 
changes in the regulatory environment relating to the telecommunications and media industry could adversely affect prodigy s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
as the law in this area develops  prodigy s potential liability for information available through its services could require prodigy to implement measures to reduce its exposure to this liability 
regulation of the internet and online services industry could result in increased telecommunications costs or competition for participants in the internet industry  including prodigy 
prodigy cannot predict whether  or to what extent  any new regulation will occur  or what effect any new regulation would have on it 
due to the increasing use of the internet  additional laws may be adopted covering issues such as content  user privacy  pricing  libel  intellectual property protection and infringement and technology export and other controls
