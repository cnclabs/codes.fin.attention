net income for the fiscal year ended september   was million  increasing from the million reported for the fiscal year ended september  net income per common share assuming dilution was in fiscal compared to per share for the fiscal year ended september  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our its credit facility 
we also generated liquidity through the sale of equity in  which proceeds were used to reduce debt and to finance capital expansions 
cash and temporary investments totaled million and net working capital totaled million at september  at september   cash and temporary cash investments totaled million and working capital totaled million 
the million increase in working capital was financed with the existing credit facility and the increases in our operating results 
our net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  the increases during these periods are primarily a result of increases in net income before non cash charges  offset by volume related increases in net working capital investment

our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants which include  among other things  financial covenants requiring minimum and cumulative earnings levels and limitations on the payment of dividends  stock purchases and our ability to enter into certain contractual arrangements 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on business or results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the credit agreement 
we currently use cash to fund capital expenditures  repayments of debt and working capital requirements and our stock repurchase program 
we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures  repayments of indebtedness  working capital requirements  and possible stock repurchase programs 
on april   we completed an expansion of our revolving credit facility by adding a multi currency feature 
available credit under the expanded credit facility is million compared with million previously 
the expanded facility eliminates the previously scheduled step downs of available credit and allows us to borrow in dollars or up to million in euro equivalents 
our new manufacturing facility in italy provides the opportunity to borrow in euros with minimal net currency exposure at rates well below current dollar denominated rates 
at september   the three month libor rate was  the three month euribor rate was  and our aggregate  weighted average bank debt borrowing rate was 
we utilize interest rate agreements and foreign exchange contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
the principal objective of such financial derivative contracts is to moderate the effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we  as a matter of policy  do not speculate in financial markets and therefore do not hold these contracts for trading purposes 
we utilize what are considered straight forward instruments  such as forward foreign exchange contracts and non leveraged interest rate swaps  to accomplish our objectives 
at this time  the current and projected borrowings under our credit facility do not exceed the facility s available commitment 
the facility matures on october  we anticipate that any borrowings outstanding at that time will be satisfied with funds from operations or will be refinanced 
we have no other material commitments 
we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided by financing activities will be sufficient to meet our expected capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and be measured at fair value 
gains or losses from changes in the derivative values are to be accounted for based on how the derivative was used and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
when adopted in october  this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other matters none 
effect of inflation during the last three fiscal periods  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
we have experienced increases in our cost of borrowing and raw materials  though generally not related to inflation 
in general  we have increased the majority of customer sales prices to recover significant raw material cost increases 
however  these changes in prices have historically lagged price increases in our raw material costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk associated with financial instruments relate to interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currency 
we occasionally utilize simple derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage our mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
no such swaps were outstanding at september  and all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates 
if these rates were to change by  the estimated additional interest expense would have been approximately  for the year ended september  the impact was not material for the years ended september  and we hedge our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with eruo borrowings under our credit facility 
changes in the us dollar equivalent of euro based borrowings is recorded as a component of the net translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity 
we have operations in italy 
the functional currency for this operation is the lira 
at september   long term debt includes foreign subsidiary obligations of million euros million under a credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate based upon the euribor rate
