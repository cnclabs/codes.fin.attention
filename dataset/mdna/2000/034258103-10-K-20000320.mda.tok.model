item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition general 
the company s results of operations depend to a great extent on the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on the loan and investment portfolios and the interest paid by the bank on deposits and borrowed funds  the size of the provisions or credits for loan losses and operating expenses 
net interest income is primarily affected by the level of earning assets as a percentage of total assets  the level of interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
earnings are also affected by non interest income which consists primarily of mortgage banking income  transaction account fees  gains and losses on sales of the investment portfolio and real estate operations 
the levels of operating expenses and income taxes also affect earnings 
on june   the company merged andover bank nh with and into andover bank with the two banking offices of andover bank nh remaining in full operation as branches of andover bank 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated results of operations for the last three years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal and this section is intended to be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the following also contains forward looking statements 
there are a number of important risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  without limitation  those set forth under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations andover generated net income of million or per diluted share  million or per diluted share and million or per diluted share in  and  respectively 
andover s return on average assets increased in to  as compared to in and in return on average stockholders equity decreased in to  as compared to in and in the company s financial performance in includes a pre tax gain of million from the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan  increased mortgage banking income and an increase in net interest income 
the company s financial performance in was positively impacted by a credit for loan losses of million and an increase in net interest income 
the financial performance in was impacted by an increase in total earning assets as well as the net yield on those assets 
net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income was million in  million in and million in net interest income increased million in  million during and million during  primarily due to higher average earning asset volumes in each of the years 
market interest rates have been fairly volatile over the past several years 
during  market interest began to rise in the spring and continued to rise throughout the year 
the company was able to hold the rates paid on deposits during in spite of the market rate increase  the effect of which allowed the interest rate spread to widen to and the net yield to increase to in during  the difference between longer term interest rates and shorter term interest rates lessened  thereby creating a flat yield curve 
this compression in the margins was reflected in the declines in both the interest rate spread of and the net yield of for in  the interest rate spread of and the net yield of were favorably impacted by market interest rates 
the amount of foregone interest income from nonaccruing and restructured loans totaled  in   in and  in average earning assets increased in to  million as of december   and increased during to  million 
the increase in each of the two years was primarily due to higher loan growth resulting from increased loan originations and purchases 
the volatility in the interest rates has also impacted the yields earned on the investment portfolio 
the yield on short term investments decreased basis points during to  while also decreasing basis points during to 
the yields earned on investment securities decreased basis points in to as compared to in and the yield on mortgage backed securities decreased and basis points during and  respectively  to and  respectively 
in the latter part of  there were three increases in the federal funds rate totaling basis points 
during  there were three decreases in the federal funds rate totaling basis points while there was an increase of basis points in the swings in the federal funds rate have impacted the short term investment yield in a corresponding manner 
the decline in the yield on mortgage backed securities reflects the decline in long term interest rates since the cash flows generated by the high prepayment activity were unable to be reinvested at a comparable interest rate 
total average loans increased million during and million during primarily due to retained loan originations and whole loan purchases 
the yield on real estate loans decreased basis points in to while decreasing basis points during to 
the largest component of the yield on real estate loans was residential loans 
due to the compression in the yield curve in  the biggest impact has been felt in the residential portfolio as evidenced by the and basis point decline  respectively  in the average yield during and the yields on the commercial real estate and construction and land portfolios have declined slightly over the past two years 
the yield on consumer loans decreased basis points in to and increased basis points in to 
the impact of the declines in the prime rate in the fourth quarter of was felt in the yield on commercial loans decreased basis points in to and decreased basis points during to 
the decline in the yield on commercial loans reflects a decline in the prime rate as well as competitive pricing pressures 
in addition  the yield on the lease financings  included in the commercial portfolio  was lower than the portfolio  thereby dragging down the overall yield 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased basis points in to  and decreased basis points during to 
core deposits  which include now  savings and money market accounts  typically have rates lower than those paid on certificates of deposit 
however  to grow the core deposit balances  the bank has offered promotional rates on certain products 
while the bank reduced the rates in in connection with a decline in market interest rates  the impact of the rate reduction was felt in the impact of the promotional rates on the savings rate has been an increase of basis points in and basis points in average balances on these savings accounts  meanwhile  have grown by million and million  respectively  in and the bank moderated the rates it paid on money market accounts and had a decrease in the rate paid of and basis points  respectively  in and however  the balances maintained in money market accounts have declined in each of those years as customers have migrated to the savings account promotional products 
the balances maintained in now accounts have increased modestly in both years while the rates have remained fairly stable during that same time period 
certificate of deposit average balances decreased million and million  respectively  and the rates paid decreased and basis points  respectively  during and the decline in the average balances and rates paid on the certificates of deposit reflect the customers desire to migrate out of longer term deposits into core deposit or short term maturities 
the company has continued its reliance on borrowed funds as an alternative source of funds to deposits in order to grow average earning assets 
during  the average balance of borrowed funds increased million while the rate paid decreased basis points 
in  the average balance of borrowed funds increased million while the rate paid decreased basis points 
the company s reliance on shorter term borrowed funds in allowed it to keep the rates paid on its borrowed funds low in spite of the overall increase in market rates 
the decline in the rate paid on borrowed funds in was due to the reduction in overall market interest rates 
the combination of the factors mentioned above contributed to a basis point increase to in the interest rate spread in and a basis point decline in the interest rate spread to during the net yield on earnings assets was for the year ended december  and and  respectively  for and the following table presents an analysis of the average yields earned and rates paid for the years indicated

rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the changes in interest income and interest expense caused by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in interest rates received and paid  respectively 
the change attributable to a mix of volume and rate has been allocated proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to the statement of operations 
the allowance is reduced by a credit for loan losses as well as loan charge offs 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet possible losses in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors management may consider are the quality of specific loans  risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  the level of nonaccruing loans  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies  actual charge off experience  and the collateral values of the underlying security 
ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates and future additions may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review the bank s allowance and may require the bank to provide additions to the allowance based on their assessment  which may differ from management s assessment 
the provision for loan losses in and was  and  respectively  as compared to a credit for loan losses in of million 
net recoveries amounted to  in  while net charge offs totaled  in and  in the provision for loan losses of  in was taken in the fourth quarter due to the fact that almost half of the corporate loan growth occurred in the fourth quarter  which when combined with the sudden deterioration of two lease financing relationships  necessitated the charge to earnings 
the credit for loan losses in resulted from an improvement in overall loan quality  as reflected by the decline in nonaccruing loans  decline in total overdue loans and net charge offs of  the decline in the provision recorded in from reflects  among other things  a reduction in non performing assets and reduced levels of delinquencies  combined with lower levels of net charge offs 
while management believes that it has been reasonable in its analysis of the allowance for loan losses and in estimating the net fair values of other real estate owned  management is unable to predict the ultimate course of the economy or the extent of its impact on the company s financial condition

non interest income 
the company recorded income from non interest sources of million in both and and million in the increase of  in resulted from an increase of million in mortgage banking income offset by losses from the sales of assets held for sale and investments available for sale 
the decrease in was primarily due to losses relating to mortgage banking activities  offset by gains on real estate operations and increased fee income on deposits and loans 
net losses from sales and redemptions of investments totaled  in  compared to net gains of  in and  in in the third quarter of  approximately million of lower yielding investments available for sale were sold at a loss of  the reinvestment of the sales proceeds was intended to enhance future earnings 
see financial condition investments and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded net gains from sales of assets held for sale of  in   in and  in included in each of the three years were gains totaling   and  respectively  from the capitalization of originated mortgage servicing rights 
see financial condition loans and notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
andover may incur gains and losses on the sale of the loans that it originates 
these loans are generally securitized prior to sale in the form of mortgage backed securities which are guaranteed by a government agency and are then held for sale 
because loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or market value and mortgage backed securities held for sale are stated at fair value  periods of rising interest rates  such as was experienced in  cause the values of loans and mortgage backed securities held for sale to decrease  resulting in a charge to income 
the company frequently enters into forward delivery contracts to reduce its exposure to this risk from rising interest rates 
forward delivery contracts may  however  increase exposure to the risk from declining interest rates if sufficient loans or mortgage backed securities held for sale bearing interest rates specified by the contracts are not available to meet the delivery schedules under the contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
mortgage banking income represents the gross servicing fee income less amortization and provisions or credits for the valuation allowance on the mortgage servicing assets 
the company retains as a service fee a portion of the interest paid by the borrower 
a valuation allowance for mortgage servicing assets was established in a credit to the valuation allowance was recorded in totaling  as compared to provisions charged against earnings totaling million and  respectively  for the years ended december  and in a low interest rate environment  the underlying residential loans will repay faster than expected  causing the fair value of the mortgage servicing assets to decline as well as reduce the gross cash flows collected on a shrinking serviced portfolio 
this prepayment risk results in increased provisions and charge offs to the valuation allowance  and thus lower mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income totaled  in  as compared to a mortgage banking loss of  in and income of million in the increase in income in was mainly due to the change in fair values caused by higher market interest rates  thereby enabling the company to record a credit to the valuation allowance 
the gross servicing income has fluctuated over the past three years but generally corresponds to the level of average loans serviced for investors 
the table below summarizes the company s results from servicing loans for investors 
years ended december  in thousands gross servicing income    amortization    credit provisions for valuation allowance  net mortgage banking income loss  average loans serviced for investors    year end loans serviced for investors    during  and  the company purchased mortgage servicing rights to million  million and million  respectively  in residential first mortgage loans 
these purchased balances are included in the balance of loans serviced for investors 
as part of its long term business plan  the company intends to continue purchasing mortgage servicing rights to maintain  or even increase  the use of its existing servicing capacity as well as increase non interest income when it is deemed appropriate 
the company also expects to continue selling mortgages in the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights  therefore  servicing income related to this activity is accordingly expected to continue for the foreseeable future

losses on real estate operations totaled  in  versus gains of  in  compared to losses of  in real estate operations consist of provisions for the valuation allowance caused by declines in net fair value  operating costs of maintaining other real estate owned  gains or losses on sales of properties and costs associated with the foreclosure on nonaccrual properties  less any rental income on other real estate owned 
the company accounts for other real estate owned at the lower of cost or estimated net fair value 
declines in value subsequent to foreclosure or substantive repossession result in a charge to the valuation allowance 
in and  credit provisions were taken to reduce the valuation allowance in the amount of  and  respectively  while replenishing the valuation allowance resulted in a charge of  in gains on sales of other real estate owned totaled  in   in and  in the costs of foreclosing on loans  as well as the administrative costs of maintaining the non performing assets  correspond with the average volumes of problem assets and totaled  in   in and  in see financial condition risk elements and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was derived primarily from customer service charges and fees 
deposit account service charges  representing the largest component of such other income  totaled million in  million in and million in loan late charges and other fees decreased during by  to  while increasing in to  and remaining stable in at  respectively 
the majority of the increase in deposit fee income in each of the two years is due to increased atm fee income 
as customers increasingly use debit cards or non customers use the bank s multiple atm s  overall fee income has increased 
the swings in the loan fee income reflect the changes in the residential loan originations which increased tremendously in and then decreased in another source of income that has remained stable in each of the three years is rental income 
other income totaled   and  respectively  for  and and includes income from liberty securities  ira  safe deposit and miscellaneous charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest expense 
non interest expenses decreased  or to million in while increasing  or to million in the decrease in was primarily due to the curtailment and settlement gains of million on terminating the company s defined benefit plan 
the modest increase in reflects higher salary costs due to merit increases partially offset by a higher level of capitalized loan origination costs resulting from the high level of originations as well as the company s continued attempts at cost containment 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  decreased  to million in and increased  in to million 
the decrease in resulted from the aforementioned gains of million from the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan which were reflected as a reduction of salary and employee benefits 
offsetting these gains  however  were increased costs for higher staff levels  merit increases and employee benefits 
the increase in was primarily due to increased benefits offset by higher levels of capitalized loan origination costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
office occupancy and equipment increased  to million in and increased  in to million 
the increase in was primarily due to increased depreciation costs on equipment purchases and high expenses on the company s leased properties 
the increase in was primarily due to increased rental expense resulting from rental increases and more properties leased from third parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
data processing expenses totaled million in  million in and million in data processing expenses increased  in and  in due to a higher loan and deposit base resulting from the purchase of loans and mortgage loan servicing and internally generated loan growth 
in addition  the introduction of alternative delivery systems  via customers computers  debit cards and by the telephone service center  have caused overall processing costs to increase in each of the two years 
the level of data processing expenses incurred in on behalf of the company s effort in its yk compliance was approximately  see financial condition year readiness disclosure 
professional fees  including corporate legal and accounting and auditing expenses  totaled million in   in and  in professional fees increased  in due to increased recruiting expenses and consulting fees 
professional fees increased  in due to increased consulting and corporate legal expenses 
marketing expenses totaled  in   in and  in marketing expenses increased  in  due to an increase in discretionary promotions while expenses decreased  in due to a reduction in the number of discretionary promotions and direct mail solicitations 
mortgage banking expenses totaled  in   in and  in costs included in mortgage banking expenses are commissions and related expenses paid to the mortgage loan originators  net of any deferred origination expenses  and costs associated with servicing the portfolio for outside investors 
the swing in expenses in each of the two years reflect the level of origination volume 
other operating expenses totaled million in  million in and million in some of the cost savings in result from the combination of the two subsidiary banks as well as a continued focus on cost containment 
the company has experienced some savings in the area of corporate insurance and telephone expenses 
the increase of  in was distributed among multiple categories and generally reflected costs associated with running a larger organization 
federal and state income tax expense 
the company recorded tax expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and realized effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
the income tax expense increase of million in resulted from an increase in pre tax income of offset by tax benefits of  the increase in was primarily due to an increase in pre tax income of million offset by a million tax benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of several tax issues that had previously been fully reserved against 
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the provision of enacted tax laws and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates 
management believes the existing net deductible temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred income tax asset will reverse in periods in which the company generates net taxable income 
for the years ending december    and  the company generated taxable income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
taxable income differs from pretax book income primarily as a result of loan losses and provision for losses on other real estate owned being recognized in a different period than for book income 
the company recorded a reduction of the valuation allowance of  in and  in the amount recognized in was due to the expiration of subsidiary net operating loss carry forwards while the amounts recognized in were due to increased recoverable federal income taxes 
at december   the net deferred tax asset is supported by recoverable income taxes of approximately million 
management believes that the net deferred income tax asset at december  will be realized based upon the high level of taxable income in the past three years 
it should be noted  however  that factors beyond management s control  such as the general state of the economy and real estate values  can affect future levels of taxable income and that no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully absorb gross deductible temporary differences 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
financial condition total assets increased million  or  to  million at december  the growth in total assets was primarily due to an increase of million in total loans 
total assets at december  amounted to  million  an increase of million or from  million at december   resulting primarily from an increase in total loans of million 
loans total loans at december   prior to the allowance for loan losses  amounted to  million compared with  million at december   an increase of million or  primarily due to internally generated loan growth combined with purchases of million in residential and commercial real estate whole loans 
as of december   of andover s total loan portfolio consisted of loans with adjustable rates as compared to at december   reflecting the increased preference for fixed rate loans by the bank s corporate customers

origination volumes are sensitive to market rates  particularly in the residential loan refinancing arena 
as can be determined by the following table  total loan originations were the highest in  a year with low interest rates throughout the year 
at the start of  low interest rates prevailed but in the spring of  market interest rates increased  a trend that continued through the year 
however  total loan originations were strong in each of the other years but the mix between retail and corporate originations changes in relation to the level of mortgage refinance activity

     residential loan originations totaled million in  million in and million in it should be noted that these originations are not fully reflected in loan balances outstanding due to the securitization  regular amortization and prepayments of residential real estate loans as well as refinancings and the sale of a portion of new loan production 
as mentioned above  the originations of residential loans are sensitive to market interest rates and experienced extremely high levels of refinancings 
the majority of the company s residential loans are underwritten to be eligible for sale in the secondary market 
andover sells most of the eligible year fixed rate loans it originates 
a loan which the company intends to sell may be sold directly or converted into mortgage backed securities and sold in that form 
residential loans sold directly amounted to million in  million in and million in those sold in the form of mortgage backed securities held for sale or available for sale totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and the portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  commercial real estate loans increased million in to million at december   while construction and land loan balances increased million to million in the same period 
outstanding commercial loans increased million in to million at december  while originations of corporate loans  comprised of commercial real estate  commercial  construction and land loans and lease financings  are sensitive to the interest rate environment  a customer s capacity for borrowing  real estate values and current and anticipated economic conditions have a more critical role 
origination volumes for these loan types have increased substantially in  reflecting increasing real estate values  higher capacity for borrowings  as well as the company s continued interest in corporate lending 
total originations of corporate loans were million in  million in and million in not all originations reflect the balances advanced at the time of origination due to amounts available for future commitments  nor does it reflect the level of prepayments experienced in the corporate loans 
commercial real estate  construction and land  commercial loans and lease financings involve significant risks compared with single family residential mortgage and consumer lending 
see item  business lending activities 
consumer loans outstanding decreased modestly to million at december   and decreased million in a large component of the decline during resulted from the sale of student loans totaling million 
over the past four years  the company has aggressively priced its home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans  thereby keeping originations of these loans in excess of million per year 
other consumer loans include collateral loans and installment loans 
originations of consumer loans are also sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment

loans transferred into other real estate owned totaled   and million in  and  respectively the impact of existing non performing assets on future interest income will be largely dependent upon converting these assets to earning status  either through a return to performing status or through foreclosure and subsequent disposition of the property 
at december   total impaired loans were million  of which million had related allowances of  and million which did not require a related impairment allowance 
all of the million in impaired loans have been measured using the fair value of the collateral method 
during the year ended december   the average recorded value of impaired loans was million and the related amount of interest income recognized was see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
nonaccruing loans 
management places loans  regardless of collateral values  on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against current period interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans for which payments are less than days past due are placed on nonaccrual status when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest 
non performing loans are generally not returned to performing status until the obligation is brought current and when concern no longer exists as to the collectibility of principal or interest

allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans during  loans on nonaccrual decreased to million  throughout most loan categories 
interest income of approximately  would have been recorded in on nonaccruing loans if those loans had been on a current basis in accordance with their original terms 
interest income actually recognized in on nonaccruing loans amounted to approximately  additionally  another  in interest payments were received on nonaccruing loans during and applied as a reduction of the loan balance instead of as interest income 
restructured loans 
a restructured loan is one for which the bank has modified the terms to provide a temporary reduction in the rate of interest below the prevailing market interest rates at the time of modification and  in most instances  an extension of payments of principal or interest or both due to the deterioration in the financial position of the borrowers 
restructured loans are not returned to performing status until the obligation has performed for a reasonable period of time  its ultimate collectibility is no longer in doubt and is at a market rate of interest 
restructured loans totaled  at december other real estate owned

the valuation allowance represents management s estimate of the net fair value of other real estate owned 
the following table shows the composition of other real estate owned at december in thousands other real estate owned   valuation allowance total other real estate owned   all other real estate owned is carried at the lower of the carrying value of the loan or the net fair value of the property

allowance for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the activity in andover s allowance for loan losses during the five years ended december dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year      provision credit for loan losses

management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
see results of operations provision for loan losses 
management measures the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses by assigning loans into risk categories based on a loan classification system modeled after the bank regulatory classification system 
while management believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover possible losses  there are uncertainties regarding future events 
deterioration in the real estate market or economy may result in additions to nonaccruing loans  charge offs or provisions for loan losses to maintain an adequate allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various categories of the portfolio is also made periodically  based on management s judgment in weighing various factors  including the quality of specific loans  the level of nonaccruing loans in the various categories  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and prior charge offs  and the collateral value of the underlying security 
because the allowance for loan losses is based on various estimates  including loan collectibility and real estate values  and includes a high degree of judgment  subsequent changes in the general economic prospects of the borrowers may require changes in those estimates 
the changes in the allowance allocated to each category of loan directly corresponds to the level of nonaccrual loans and adversely classified loans as well as the level of outstanding loans 
andover historically has experienced lower losses in its residential mortgage loan portfolio and  therefore  allocations applicable to this portfolio are lower

the primary objectives are to provide interest and dividend income  to ensure adequate liquidity and achieve an acceptable asset liability gap position while diversifying the asset mix 
the investment portfolio is also evaluated in comparison to returns that are earned by the loan portfolio 
during the third quarter of  approximately million of lower yielding investments were sold at a loss of  these included us government obligations and gnma mortgage backed securities 
the reinvestment of the sales proceeds was intended to enhance future earnings 
the principal component of the total investment portfolio is mortgage backed securities  which accounted for of total investments at december  the remaining portion of the total investment portfolio consists of us government and federal agency obligations  corporate bonds  short term investments  equity securities and other investment grade securities 
corporate bonds represent the fastest growing component of the investment portfolio and totaled as of december   as compared to at year end all of the mortgage backed securities represent undivided interests in pools of mortgages which have been formed into pass through securities and sold to investors by gnma  fhlmc and fnma 
securities issued by gnma  a wholly owned us government corporation  are fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest 
securities issued by fhlmc and fnma  government sponsored corporations  carry each corporation s guarantee as to the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal 
cash flows from the underlying mortgages of all mortgage backed securities are passed through to andover in the form of monthly payments of interest  scheduled principal amortization  and prepayments of mortgage balances 
these securities  therefore  have unpredictable cash flows 
principal repayments on all mortgaged backed securities in the investment portfolio totaled million in as compared to million in  reflecting  among other things  the slowdown in the mortgage refinance market 
the approximate market value of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities included in the investment portfolio totaled million at december   as compared to million at december   primarily due to the sale of investments mentioned above

trading securities are debt and equity securities held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term 
the company does not have any securities designated as trading securities 
such securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in earnings 
investments available for sale are any debt or equity security not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities 
investments available for sale are recorded at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of related income taxes 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
there was a fair value decline of million in the investment portfolio  from a net unrealized gain of million at december  to a net unrealized loss of million at december   resulting from a significant increase in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates and their impact on the unrealized gain or loss in the investment portfolio are not material factors in the company s overall investment strategy 
this is largely due to the fact that neither the changes nor their impact can be controlled by the company 
additionally  investment purchases are often funded by long term advances of an equivalent term in order to achieve a consistent spread on a particular investment

the decline in certificates of deposit balances reflect the continued customer preference for shorter term or core deposit accounts without fixed maturities 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in the savings account balances of million and million in and  respectively 
the popularity of these accounts were primarily due to the introduction of a tiered savings product offering customers a premium rate on balances in excess of  this premium product represents more than half of the savings account balances 
the decline in each of the past two years in money market accounts is primarily due to a shift in customer preference for the premium savings account

the bank will continue to rely on borrowed funds as an alternative source of funds in order to grow interest earning assets 
the bank has multiple sources for borrowed funds  including its primary source  the fhlb of boston 
the weighted average rate on the total borrowed funds dropped to at december   from at december  the decline in the weighted average interest rate since year end was due to a change in the mix of borrowed funds and reflects the shorter term maturities at december  borrowed funds  maturing within one year or with an initial call date within one year as of december   were approximately as compared to at december  this reliance on shorter term borrowed funds in has allowed the company to keep the rates paid on its borrowed funds low in spite of the overall increase in market interest rates

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
asset and liability management and market risk the bank s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the company seeks to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  or market risk  through active monitoring and management of its interest rate risk exposure 
the policies and procedures for managing both on and off balance sheet activities are established by andover s asset liability management committee alco 
the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors its related activities on an ongoing basis 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and to preserve capital  while adjusting the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the following two tables reflect different methods of disclosing the company s exposure to a change in interest rates and its potential impact on the company s net interest income 
the gap analysis uses estimated prepayments  contractual maturities and next repricing dates while the market risk analysis excludes the next repricing dates 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities in both tables would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions provided 
one method used to measure the interest rate risk exposure is the company s gap analysis  which involves comparing the difference between assets and liabilities that mature or reprice during a given period of time 
these differences are a primary component of the risk to net interest income 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
a positive gap would produce increased net interest income during a period of rising interest rates and decreased net interest income when interest rates decline 
a negative gap would have the reciprocal impact on net interest income 
the primary cause for the change in the company s gap position from december  to december   was the prepayment speeds used on the residential loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios from one year to the next 
this resulted in a negative gap position of at december   as compared to at december  the following table illustrates the company s gap position  or the estimated maturity and repricing structure of its interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  at december  days days years years years total dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets fixed rate securities       variable rate securities    fixed rate loans       variable rate loans       other interest sensitive assets   total interest sensitive assets       interest sensitive liabilities now accounts       savings and money market deposit accounts       certificates of deposit      total borrowed funds       total interest sensitive liabilities       net interest rate sensitivity gap       cumulative net interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative net interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets at december  cumulative net interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative net interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets the balances on the interest sensitive asset and liability accounts have been allocated among the various periods using common industry techniques and market consensus data 
fixed and variable rate retail loans  the largest component of the loan portfolio  are shown in the table in the time period corresponding to scheduled principal amortization and anticipated prepayments using annual conditional prepayment rates that vary from to at december   as compared with to at december  in addition  variable rate retail and corporate loans are allocated to the periods in which the loans could be next adjusted 
fixed rate mortgage backed securities are allocated using annual conditional prepayment rates of to at december   versus to at december  all other loans and securities  certificates of deposit and borrowed funds are allocated to the period in which the rates could be next adjusted or to their final contractual maturity for the fixed rate instruments 
substantially all of the callable advances from the fhlb are allocated according to their initial call dates due to the strong likelihood of their being called by the fhlb given current market interest rates 
other interest sensitive assets include assets held for sale and fhlb stock 
nonaccruing loans have been excluded from both the gap analysis and the market risk analysis 
a substantial portion of the savings  money market and now accounts are considered core deposits by management and  therefore  relatively insensitive to interest rates 
in addition  any future changes to the interest rates paid on these accounts are at the sole discretion of management 
despite the foregoing factors  these deposits have been allocated between each time period based on the bank s own historical experience  or decay rates  in determining the deposit runoff 
another method used to measure interest rate risk is the market risk analysis 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  expected maturity date as of december  fair value at thereafter total dollars in millions interest sensitive assets fixed rate securities average interest rate variable rate securities average interest rate fixed rate retail loans average interest rate variable rate retail loans average interest rate fixed rate corporate loans average interest rate variable rate corporate loans average interest rate other interest sensitive assets average interest rate total interest sensitive assets   interest sensitive liabilities now accounts average interest rate savings and money market deposit accounts average interest rate certificates of deposit average interest rate total borrowed funds average interest rate total interest sensitive liabilities 
  at december  total interest sensitive assets   total interest sensitive liabilities 
  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for interest sensitive assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal using the same ratios used for the gap analysis presented previously 
however  as mentioned above  the market risk analysis excludes repricing features on all interest sensitive assets 
retail loans include residential and consumer loans while corporate loans are comprised of commercial real estate  commercial  construction and land loans and leases 
for interest sensitive liabilities  the same decay rates and contractual maturities used for the gap analysis are used for the market risk analysis 
the only difference between the gap analysis and the market analysis of the interest sensitive liabilities are the callable features on the fhlb advances 
the market risk analysis uses the advances contractual maturity date in all cases  whereas the gap report allocates the callable advances using their respective initial call date 
the following table reflects the scheduled maturities of selected loans at december  one over less than through five one year five years years total in thousands construction and land loans     commercial loans    of the loans maturing after one year  million  or  have fixed rates and million  or  have floating or variable rates

dividends from the bank to the company totaled million in  million in and million in the company made payments of dividends to stockholders in the amount of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the goal of the company s liquidity management process is to assess funding requirements so as to efficiently meet the cash needs of borrowers and depositors  while also providing funds for attractive investment opportunities 
liquidity involves the company s ability to raise or gain access to funds in order to fulfill its existing and anticipated financial obligations 
the bank has a diverse base of funding 
sources of liquidity include maturation  amortization and prepayment of the investment and loan portfolios 
in addition  the bank s investments available for sale portfolio provides the bank with flexibility to sell these securities quickly 
other sources of liquidity are increasing deposit balances  funds purchased from other banks  the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  customer repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the fhlb  of which andover bank is a voluntary member 
the bank may also obtain funds at the discount window of the federal reserve bank of boston

outstanding commitments to originate loans totaled million 
unadvanced portions of construction and land loans amounted to million 
standby letters of credit were million 
loans sold with recourse totaled million 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet these commitments if and as called upon

cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million to million at december   and increased by million to million at december  the increase in cash flows provided in was due to a decrease in assets held for sale 
the change in was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and an increase in accrued income taxes payable 
cash flows used by investing activities increased by million to million during and decreased million during to million 
the change in was primarily attributable to a much higher level of purchases of investments and mortgage backed securities available for sale and increased purchases of whole loans 
the decrease in was due to a large reduction in the purchases of whole loans 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million to million during due to a significant increase in total borrowed funds offset by a decline in deposits 
the decrease of million in cash flows provided by financing activities to million at december   was mainly attributable to a smaller increase in deposits 
capital resources at december   the company reported total capital of million  or of total assets as compared to million  or at december  the company and the bank continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of all applicable regulatory minimums

impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on operations of andover is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
year disclosure the year computer software compliance issues affected andover and many other financial institutions and companies in the us the primary concern was that computer programs would not recognize the proper date which could then generate erroneous data or cause systems to fail  thereby creating an adverse impact on the company s business and possibly its operating results 
the company started its year initiative in early prior to the end of  the company completed its assessment  testing and remediating of year issues 
the company developed multiple contingency plans  tested its various software information systems  hardware components and non technology systems and arranged for the required human and financial resources to complete its necessary remediation efforts 
due to the extensive planning and testing over the past three years  the company did not experience any year difficulties with regards to software  hardware or non technology systems 
included in other noninterest expenses during were charges incurred in connection with the modification or replacement of software and hardware in order for the company s computer systems to properly recognize the year the level of data processing expenses and consulting services incurred in was approximately  and  respectively 
total expenses incurred and hardware capitalized were approximately  for the year ended december  and  over the course of the project 
recent accounting developments in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement  as amended by sfas  is effective for financial statements issued for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  early application is encouraged but restatement of prior periods is prohibited 
sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company
