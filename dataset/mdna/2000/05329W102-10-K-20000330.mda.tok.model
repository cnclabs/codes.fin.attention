business combinations we have established framework agreements with various manufacturers that allow us to acquire franchised automotive dealerships subject to various limits and conditions 
since  we have aggressively expanded our automotive retail operations through the acquisition of franchised automotive dealerships 
we currently expect that we will continue to complete acquisitions of franchised automotive dealerships during however  we do not expect to complete acquisitions at the same pace we have in the past 
acquisitions to be completed in will tend to be single dealerships or small dealership groups focused in key markets in which we already conduct operations  or strategic acquisitions to enhance our e commerce business

continuing operations we are the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
we own and operate more than new vehicle franchises from dealership locations in major metropolitan markets in states  predominantly in the sunbelt states 
our business consists primarily of the sale  financing and servicing of new and used vehicles 
we also provide other related services and products  such as the sale of parts and accessories  extended service contracts  aftermarket automotive products and collision repair services 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell are manufactured or distributed by general motors corporation  ford motor company  daimlerchrysler corporation  toyota motor sales  usa  inc  american honda motor co  inc 
and nissan north america  inc we also sell several luxury vehicle brands  including mercedes benz  bmw  lexus and porsche 
in total  we offer different brands of vehicles 
our historical operating results include the results of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition for acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
due to our aggressive expansion through acquisitions  year over year comparisons of our reported operating results do not provide a meaningful representation of our internal performance 
accordingly  we have presented below our operating results for the years ended december  and on a same store basis to better represent our internal performance 
same store operating data the following table sets forth the components of same store revenue  with the percentage change between periods  and same store gross margin  same store selling  general and administrative expenses and same store performance margin  with percentages of total same store revenue and with the percentage change between periods  for the years ended december in millions change revenue new vehicle   used vehicle   fixed operations   other gross margin   s  g a   store performance margin overall  our same store performance margins increased to million during  primarily due to increases in same store sales partially offset by decreased gross margins and other factors described below 
same store sales were billion for the year ended december  versus billion for the year ended december   an increase of 
the primary components of the same store sales increase are described below 
in  the automotive retail industry experienced a record level of new vehicle unit sales volume representing an increase of over our new vehicle same store sales increased to billion during the year ended december  due to an increase in unit volume of and price increases of 
the used vehicle market has been less robust due  in part  to strong manufacturer incentives for new vehicles which we expect to continue in used vehicle same store sales at our used vehicle megastores and our franchised stores decreased to billion during the year ended december  due to a decrease in unit volume of offset by price increases of 
a increase in used vehicle revenue at our franchised stores was more than offset by a decline in used vehicle revenue at our used vehicle megastores 
as described below under the heading restructuring activities  we have exited the used vehicle megastore business 
fixed operations same store sales increased to billion during the year ended december  the increase is primarily volume driven 
same store other sales consist primarily of wholesale revenue 
same store other sales decreased to million during the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a decline in wholesale unit pricing during the period 
same store gross margins were billion for the year ended december  versus billion for the year ended december  same store gross margins as a percentage of same store total revenue were for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the decrease in same store gross margin percentage is primarily due to a shift in product mix as a result of stronger new versus used vehicle sales and  to a lesser extent  decreases in used vehicle margins 
as described above  we believe that consumer demand for used vehicles has decreased relative to demand for new vehicles due in part to aggressive manufacturer incentive programs 
same store selling  general and administrative expenses were billion during the year ended december  versus billion for the year ended december  same store selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of same store total revenue were for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to better overall leveraging of the overhead structure  although selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the latter half of due to the implementation of various corporate wide initiatives 
we have shifted our focus away from many of these initiatives  however  and more towards margin performance and on driving costs out of our business 
to this end  in late  we took dramatic steps to reduce our cost structure as described in greater detail under the heading restructuring activities below 
same store performance margins were million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  same store performance margins as a percentage of same store total revenue were for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the decrease in same store performance margins is a result of lower gross margins partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative costs described above

revenue was billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases are primarily volume driven due to acquisitions and same store sales increases previously described 
gross margins were billion  billion and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily due to acquisitions 
excluding inventory related restructuring costs described below  gross margins as a percentage of revenue were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to a shift in product mix as a result of strong new versus used vehicle sales and  to a lesser extent  decreases in used vehicle margins due in part to strong new vehicle sales 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to reduced inventory costs  product mix and the acquisition of dealerships that generated higher gross margins than our pre existing dealerships 
store selling  general and administrative expenses were billion  billion and million or  as percentages of revenue   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily due to acquisitions 
the and increases as percentages of revenue are primarily due to higher megastore fixed costs and  in  costs incurred in connection with the megastore closures and other one time costs 
store performance margins were million  million and million or  as percentages of revenue   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily due to acquisitions 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is due to lower gross margins and increased s  g a expenses as described above 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is due to increased gross margins partially offset by higher s  g a expenses 
corporate and district overhead was million  million and million or  as a percentage of revenue   
and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are a result of the overall growth we experienced during our aggressive acquisition growth phase as well as various corporate initiatives 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increased headcount and spending for various corporate initiatives which have been curtailed or eliminated in conjunction with our restructuring activities further described below 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to better leveraging of overhead costs on an expanded revenue base 
we expect our overhead costs as a percentage of revenue to return to levels 
corporate expenses which will no longer be incurred following the separation of the automotive rental division have been allocated to income from discontinued operations 
these allocated costs totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we approved a plan to restructure certain of our operations 
the restructuring plan is comprised of the following major components exiting the used vehicle megastore business by immediately closing of our used vehicle megastores and converting the six remaining stores into new vehicle franchises eight used vehicle megastores had previously been converted  and reducing the corporate workforce 
approximately  positions were eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan of which  were megastore positions and were corporate positions 
these restructuring activities resulted in a pre tax charge of million  the majority of which is non cash 
approximately million appears as restructuring and impairment charges in our consolidated statement of operations and consists of million of asset impairment charges and million of termination benefits and other exit costs 
the remaining million represents inventory related costs associated with the used vehicle megastore closures and is included in cost of operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
the million asset impairment charge consists of million of used vehicle megastore and other property impairments including million of reserves for guaranteed lease residual values for properties leased under our million lease facility described below  and million of information systems and other impairments 
our operating results include revenue and operating losses of billion and million  respectively  associated with the operations to be disposed 
we will dispose of our closed megastore and other properties primarily through sale to independent third parties 
although we intend to aggressively market these properties  the ultimate disposition could exceed one year 
expected annual carrying costs associated with closed properties total approximately million and will be charged to expense in future periods as incurred 
these restructuring and impairment charges are primarily non cash asset impairment charges which are not expected to result in a material future cash outlay except for the property carrying costs described above 
through december   we have spent approximately million of these charges primarily for severance benefits and have recorded million of these charges against certain assets 
as of december   approximately million remained in accrued liabilities related primarily to reserves for residual value guarantees described above 
we intend to fund our residual value guarantee obligation primarily using cash received from the sale of owned properties 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of pre tax charges associated with consolidating our automotive retail operations 
approximately million of these charges appear as restructuring and impairment charges in our consolidated statement of operations and consists of million for consolidation of information systems  million related to relocating or closing certain operations  and million of severance and other costs 
the remaining million of these charges relates to inventory consolidation and is included in cost of operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
during the year ended december   we reduced our estimated restructuring reserves for information systems and increased our estimated reserves for closed operations by approximately million 
the decrease in the information systems reserve is a result of our decision to eliminate or delay the conversion of certain systems 
the increase in the reserve for closed operations is due to our decision to close our vehicle reconditioning centers 
approximately million of the million charge was spent on restructuring activities and the remaining million was applied against certain assets 
included in the restructuring and impairment charges described above are million of additional estimated impairment losses related to the closed reconditioning centers and other properties held for sale 
non operating income expense interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases are primarily the result of investments in marketable securities 
interest expense interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases are due to higher average borrowings 
other income  net other income for the year ended december  consists primarily of a million pre tax gain from the may sale of our million shares of adt limited common stock  net of fees and expenses 
such shares of adt limited common stock were received in march upon our exercise of a warrant which became exercisable upon termination of our agreement to acquire adt limited by mutual agreement of the parties in september income taxes the provision for income taxes from continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although we reported a pre tax loss from continuing operations in  an income tax provision of million has been recorded due to the effect of certain non deductible expenses primarily associated with the restructuring and impairment charges 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will increase to between and in financial condition at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of availability under our billion unsecured revolving credit facilities which we may use for general corporate purposes 
as of february   we had approximately million of availability under our billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 
in march  we entered into a new million day unsecured bank revolving credit facility to replace our existing day facility which matured in march this facility complements the billion bank revolving credit facility maturing in april we have vehicle inventory financing and other credit facilities to fund our operations 
we have a million bank sponsored multi seller commercial paper conduit facility to finance new and used vehicle inventory 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under this facility 
this facility supplements the new and used vehicle inventory finance facilities provided by vehicle manufacturer captive finance companies 
we are the lessee under a million lease facility that was established to acquire and develop the used vehicle megastores and other properties 
at december   million was funded under this facility of which million has been accounted for as capital leases and the remaining million has been accounted for as operating leases 
we have guaranteed the residual value of the properties under this facility 
this guarantee totaled approximately million at december  as previously described  we have closed certain megastores and other properties  some of which are leased under this facility 
we have accrued million as part of our restructuring and impairment charges representing our estimated liability for the residual value of the closed properties 
as previously described  we expect to fund our residual value guarantee obligation primarily using proceeds from the sale of owned properties 
we have a billion commercial paper warehouse facility with unrelated financial institutions for the securitization of installment loan finance receivables 
at december   we had approximately million of capacity under this program 
we retain risk on the receivables securitized only up to our retained interest 
proceeds from securitizations are primarily used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we expect to continue to securitize receivables under this facility and or other programs 
we have entered into interest rate derivative transactions with certain financial institutions to manage the impact of interest rate changes on securitized installment loan receivables 
these derivative transactions consist of a series of interest rate caps and floors which effectuate a variable to fixed rate swap 
the weighted average fixed rate under these derivatives was at december  variable rates on the underlying portfolio are indexed to the commercial paper nonfinancial rate 
in october  we formed a non consolidated special purpose entity that issued million of asset backed notes under a billion shelf registration statement 
the weighted average fixed interest rate on these notes was 
proceeds from these notes were used to refinance installment loans previously securitized under the billion warehouse facility discussed above and to securitize additional loans 
we provide credit enhancement related to these notes in the form of overcollateralization  a reserve fund and a third party surety bond 
we retain responsibility for servicing the loans for which we are paid a servicing fee 
since the inception of our board authorized billion cumulative share repurchase programs through december  we repurchased million shares of our common stock under these programs for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
we have repurchased and expect to continue repurchasing shares under these programs 
our discontinued automotive rental operations are financed through various revenue earning vehicle and working capital debt facilities 
we provide various credit enhancements related to this financing in the form of guarantees and letters of credit 
at december   letters of credit totaling million which mature through september were outstanding related to this financing 
in february  we contributed million of capital to anc rental to replace maturing letters of credit 
anc rental s ultimate financing structure may include additional capital funding from us and or credit support in the form of guarantees or letters of credit 
we believe that we have sufficient operating cash flow and other financial resources necessary to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased increased by million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the major components of these changes are discussed below 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by used in operating activities was 
million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities was substantially higher in primarily due to the development of the used vehicle megastores 
cash flows from operating activities include purchases of vehicle inventory which are separately financed through secured vehicle financings 
accordingly  we measure our operating cash flow including net proceeds payments under these secured vehicle financings which totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
including net proceeds payments under these secured vehicle financings  the company generated used operating cash flow of million  million and million during the years ended  and  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for business acquisitions  capital additions and other transactions as further described below 
cash used in business acquisitions was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in business acquisitions from to was primarily due to our shift away from the use of our common stock to pay for acquisitions 
as previously described  we currently expect that we will continue to complete acquisitions of franchised automotive dealerships during  although such acquisitions will tend to be single dealerships or small dealership groups focused in our key existing markets 
we believe this strategy will result in substantially less cash to be used in business acquisitions in see business combinations of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  business combinations  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of business combinations 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease in due to the megastore closures  fewer acquisitions and other factors 
in july  our former solid waste subsidiary  republic services  completed an initial public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately billion 
in may  we sold substantially all of our remaining interest in republic services in a public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately billion 
proceeds from the offerings were used to repay non vehicle debt  finance acquisitions  acquire shares under our share repurchase programs and invest in our business 
in october  we sold our electronic security services division for approximately million 
in march  we exercised our warrant to acquire million common shares of adt limited for per share 
in may  we sold the million adt limited common shares for per share to certain institutional investors 
we intend to finance capital expenditures and business acquisitions through cash flow from operations  our revolving credit facilities and other financings 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities include revolving credit and vehicle floor plan financings  repayments of acquired debt  treasury stock purchases and other transactions as further described below 
during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of approximately billion under our board approved share repurchase programs 
during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of approximately million under our board approved share repurchase program 
during the year ended december   we sold million shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
cash flows from discontinued operations cash used in provided by discontinued operations was as follows during the years ended december automotive rental solid waste services electronic security services cash used in our discontinued automotive rental business consists primarily of capital expenditures for systems and airport location improvements 
cash used in provided by our former solid waste services business primarily represents bank borrowings in to fund acquisitions completed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitute forward looking statements 
all items described are non trading 
our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates  primarily in the united states 
we do not have material market risk exposures relative to changes in foreign exchange rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
these derivatives consist of interest rate swaps  caps and floors which are entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
in our continuing operations  we use variable to fixed interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate revolving credit and vehicle inventory financing facilities 
expected maturity dates for variable rate debt and interest rate swaps in the tables below are based upon contractual maturity dates 
average pay rates under interest rate swaps are based upon contractual fixed rates 
average interest rates on variable rate debt and average variable receive rates under interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
in addition  we have entered into a series of interest rate caps and floors contractually maturing through to manage the impact of interest rate changes on securitized installment loan receivables 
expected maturity dates for interest rate caps and floors in the tables below are based upon the estimated repayment of the underlying receivables after considering estimated prepayments and credit losses 
average rates on interest rate caps and floors are based upon contractual rates 
in our discontinued automotive rental operations  we use variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements and interest rate caps and floors to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate revenue earning vehicle debt 
expected maturity dates for variable rate debt and interest rate derivatives in the tables below are based upon contractual maturity dates 
average pay rates under interest rate swaps are based upon contractual fixed rates 
average interest rates on variable rate debt and average variable receive rates under interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
average rates on interest rate caps and floors are based upon contractual rates 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement 
the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
the fair value of interest rate swaps  caps and floors is determined from dealer quotations and represents the discounted future cash flows through maturity or expiration using current rates 
the fair value is effectively the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements

amounts outstanding under this commercial paper facility were billion and million at december  and  respectively 
seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year in part due to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where dealerships may be subject to harsh winters 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters 
year we believe that all of our systems are operating and that no material year issues have been encountered 
we are also presently unaware of any third party year issues that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations 
nevertheless  if any year issues presently unknown to us occur with us or with third party products and business dependencies  we may experience a delay or disruption in the delivery of products  including but not limited to  the supply of new vehicles and or original equipment manufacturer replacement parts 
either of these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations including  but not limited to  loss of revenue  increased operating costs  loss of customers or suppliers  or other significant disruptions to our business 
we spent approximately million on year efforts across all areas  of which million relates to our continuing automotive retail operations and million relates to our discontinued automotive rental operations 
we do not expect to incur any material future year related costs 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas by deferring the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we will adopt sfas beginning january  we have not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
however  sfas could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
discontinued operations automotive rental as a result of our decision to separate anc rental  the net assets and operating results of our rental segment have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have accrued a loss on disposition of the rental segment totaling million  net of income taxes 
this represents the estimated losses from operations through the expected distribution date and costs associated with the planned spin off 
anc rental primarily rents vehicles on a daily or weekly basis through alamo rent a car  inc  national car rental system  inc 
and cartemps usa 
our automotive rental operations and particularly the leisure travel market are highly seasonal 
in these operations  the third quarter  which includes the peak summer travel months  has historically been the strongest quarter of the year 
during the peak season  anc rental increases its rental fleet and workforce to accommodate increased rental activity 
as a result  any occurrence that disrupts travel patterns during the summer period could have a material adverse effect on anc rental s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the first and fourth quarters for anc rental s operations are generally the weakest  when there is limited leisure travel and a greater potential for adverse or unseasonable weather conditions 
many of the operating expenses such as rent  general insurance and administrative personnel are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased rental demand 
a summary of anc rental s operations is as follows for the years ended december in millions revenue    expenses cost of operations    selling  general and administrative restructuring and other charges operating income loss interest expense interest and other income expense

the increase in aggregate dollars over is primarily due to acquisitions and costs associated with implementing global odyssey 
the and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as percentages of revenue are primarily due to costs associated with implementing and remediating global odyssey and higher selling costs 
as previously described  anc rental s s  g a expenses include allocations of autonation corporate overhead totaling approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  anc rental approved and implemented a plan to restructure certain of its operations 
included in the plan are actions to consolidate the north american headquarters  reduce non field headcount as a result of the consolidation of the north american headquarters  renegotiate certain existing international vehicle supply agreements and rationalize revenue earning vehicle fleet  exit and consolidate certain unprofitable or marginally profitable operating locations both domestically and internationally 
anc rental anticipates substantially completing the restructuring plan prior to december  during the year ended december   anc rental recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million related to the consolidation of the north american operations  renegotiation of fleet agreements and closing of certain locations
