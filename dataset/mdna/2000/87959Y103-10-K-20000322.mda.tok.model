item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of please refer to page of this annual report on form k for additional factors relating to such statements 
general the following discussion and analysis is based on teligent s financial statements for the years ended december  through and should be read together with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview from our inception  on march   through the initiation of full scale commercial service in october  our main activities were the acquisition of licenses and authorizations  the acquisition of building access rights  the hiring of management and other key personnel  the raising of funds  the development of operating systems  the negotiation of interconnection agreements and the purchase and deployment of our equipment and network 
since october  we have initiated commercial service using our smartwave tm local networks in market areas that comprise more than cities and towns with a combined population of more than million people 
our losses  as well as our negative operating cash flow  have been significant to date  and we expect both to continue for several years until we develop a customer base that will generate sufficient revenues to fund operating expenses 
after we initiate service in most of our market areas  we expect to have positive operating margins over time by increasing the number of customers and selling them additional capacity or services without significantly increasing related capital expenditures  costs of building access rights and other operating costs 
our ability to generate positive cash flow will depend in part on the extent of capital expenditures in current and new market areas  competition in our current market areas and any potential adverse regulatory developments 
various financing sources will be required to fund our growth as well as cover our expected losses from operations 
factors affecting future operations the successful execution of our business plan is expected to result in rapid expansion of our operations 
this expansion of our operations  including our international operations  may place a significant strain on our management  financial and other resources 
our ability to manage this expansion effectively will depend upon  among other things  monitoring operations  controlling costs  maintaining regulatory compliance  raising capital to pay expenses  interconnecting successfully with the incumbent carriers  maintaining effective quality controls  securing building access  significantly expanding our internal management  technical  information and accounting systems and attracting  assimilating and retaining qualified management and professional and technical personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain senior management and key staff  expand our facilities  purchase adequate supplies of equipment  secure building access  increase the capacity of our information systems and or successfully manage and integrate such additional resources  customers could experience delays in connection of service and or lower levels of customer service 
failure to meet the demands of customers and to manage the expansion of our business and operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although fixed wireless technology has been in use for a significant period of time  our point to multipoint technology has only been commercially used on a limited basis 
we selected point to multipoint technology because we believe it complements existing wireless and wireline technologies that we employ in our networks 
if our point to multipoint technology does not perform as expected or provide the advantages that we expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
part of our strategy may be to make acquisitions in the future  some of which may be significant 
we currently have no undisclosed definitive agreements with respect to any material acquisition or joint venture  although from time to time we have discussions with other companies and assess opportunities on an ongoing basis 
revenues we offer an integrated package of local and long distance services  value added services  high speed data connectivity and internet access 
we market these services primarily to small and medium sized businesses which have been historically served by ilecs 
we seek to attract these customers through a broad product offering  superior customer service and attractive pricing 
we anticipate that some ilecs may reduce their prices as increased competition begins to reduce their market share 
we expect to remain competitive if market prices decline because of our lower network costs compared to those of the ilecs 
cost of services certain costs are required to operate and maintain our networks  including real estate leases for switching centers  base station and customer sites  preparation  installation  operation and maintenance of switching centers  base station sites and individual customer radio links  as well as customer premise equipment  leasing of backhaul facilities between base station sites and switching centers  leasing of capacity lines  network operations and data center facility expenses  the cost to interconnect and terminate traffic with other network and internet service providers  software licensing fees  and network design and base station configuration planning 
sales  general and administrative costs we incur costs related to the selling  marketing and promotion of our products and services 
these costs primarily include headcount costs for our sales and other personnel  as well as advertising costs to develop brand awareness of the teligent name 
we also incur operating costs that are common to all telecommunications providers including customer service and technical support  information systems  billing and collections  general management and overhead expense  office leases  bad debt expense and administrative functions 
those areas that will require more personnel as our customer base grows  such as customer service  will increase gradually as customer demand increases 
other areas  particularly information and billing systems  have required significant up front capital expenditures and operating costs 
capital expenditures our main capital expenditure requirements currently include the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment  base stations  network switches  switch electronics  network operations center  data centers and information technology systems 
customer premises equipment 
the purchase and installation of customer premise equipment  or cpe  is the largest single capital expense component in our business plan 
these equipment costs include an integrated radio antenna unit  modem s  power supply  multiplexer and router equipment  line interface cards  and cables and installation materials 
customers in the same building may share portions of these costs  which reduces the capital expenditures required per customer 
in the event a customer leaves us  our cpe can be used by other customers within the building or in other buildings  which reduces stranded assets 
base station site 
a base station can serve customers within a degree coverage area  subject to lines of sight 
a base station typically comprises four to eight sectors  each of which cover a section of the service area depending on coverage and capacity requirements 
each sector requires one or more radio antenna units and modems  depending on the system deployed 
construction costs per base station are typically higher than are construction costs per customer site 
we expect that our sites will typically be built on top of buildings as opposed to towers 
while a certain amount of equipment must initially be installed at each base station  the overall equipment cost will depend on the number of customers acquired 
as more customers are loaded onto a given base station area  we will add additional sectors  radio antennas and modems to the initial base station equipment to meet customer demand 
base station to switch transport 
we transport traffic between our base stations and switching sites 
to the extent we use wireless transport rather than leased fiber  we would incur capital expenditures as opposed to operating costs 
switching 
switching costs include traditional circuit based switches  line cards for interfacing with the backhaul networks and with the networks of other carriers  packet based routers  power systems  and environmental maintenance equipment 
network operations center 
network operation center costs include investments in developing a command  control and communications center to monitor and manage our entire network infrastructure 
further costs include investments in applications and commercial hardware and software solutions customized for problem identification and network monitoring 
data centers 
data centers are specifically designed for the hour a day routing of internet traffic and hosting of web sites and e mail 
costs to develop data centers include investments in computer hardware and software  multi redundant mechanics  utilities and environmental controls  security systems  and broadband connectivity 
information technology 
costs to acquire  develop and enhance information technology systems will also require significant capital investment 
systems for billing  customer services  finance and network monitoring have been or are under development or further enhancement 
costs of obtaining additional spectrum teligent s existing spectrum has been obtained through means other than competitive bidding procedures 
in the future  additional spectrum may be obtained in the united states and abroad through acquisitions and auctions 
for example  teligent recently submitted an application to participate in the ghz spectrum auction in the united states  as well as to participate in a spectrum auction in austria 
year our mission critical infrastructure transitioned into and beyond february   without incident 
we have not been advised that any of our significant suppliers or customers experienced any significant disruptions due to the year issue  and hence do not believe that any such disruption occurred 
in the event that unknown claims are hereafter brought to our attention  we may be required to expend significant management time and resources to investigate and defend against such claims 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we generated revenues of million from communication services during  compared to million during the increase in revenues is reflective of  among other things  the growth in our customer base  continued expansion into new market areas during and revenue attributable to acquisitions 
cost of services  consisting primarily of personnel related costs  telecommunications expenses and site rent and site acquisition expenses related to network operations  totaled million for  compared to million in this increase reflects the growth and development of our network operations to serve major market areas and the increased number of employees from to we expect that our cost of services will continue to increase in accordance with our growth strategy 
sales  general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of personnel related costs  were million for  compared to million in this increase primarily results from higher compensation and other personnel costs incurred during due to the increased number of employees required to drive our expected future growth 
stock based and other noncash compensation expense was million in  compared to million in depreciation and amortization for was million  compared to million in the increase is due to higher capital expenditures in and the amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions 
we expect depreciation expense to increase in the coming year as we further implement our growth strategy 
interest and other income for was million  compared to million in the decrease is due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the increase is due to higher long term debt balances resulting from borrowings made against the credit facility during and the amortization of credit facility fees and interest incurred on the senior discount notes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we generated revenues of million from communication services during  compared to  during in  we generated million of revenues related to management services and equipment leases primarily provided to two of our original stockholders 
cost of services  consisting primarily of personnel related costs and site rent and acquisition expenses related to network operations  was million for  compared with million in this increase reflects the establishment of our initial fifteen market areas and development of network operations 
sales  general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of headcount related costs  were million for  compared with million in this increase relates primarily to costs incurred to develop our infrastructure and sales force as we prepared for commencement of operations in stock based and other noncash compensation expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease is due to the charge related to company appreciation rights granted prior to our initial public offering in depreciation and amortization for was million  compared with million in  due primarily to higher capital expenditures in  and amortization expense of intangibles which were principally acquired in the fourth quarter of interest and other income for was million  compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of interest earned on increased levels of cash and investments resulting from our initial public equity offering and our two debt offerings in and interest expense was million for  compared to million in this increase was due to the senior notes issued in november and the senior discount notes issued in february liquidity and capital resources we have approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of march  and approximately million available under our credit facilities million of which we do not expect to be available until the second half of 
in order to develop our business  we will need a significant amount of money to pay for equipment  meet our debt obligations  bid on spectrum auctions  operate our business on a day to day basis  acquire complementary assets or businesses and contribute additional capital to our international ventures 
our principal equipment related needs include the purchase and installation of cpe  base stations  network switches and switch electronics  network operations and data center expenditures and information systems  platforms and interfaces 
based on our current business plan  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand and our credit facilities will provide enough money to carry out our current business plan into actual requirements may vary based upon the timing and success of our roll out 
if demand for our services is lower than anticipated  we may be able to cut back on purchases of equipment such as cpe and switch electronics  which are not needed until a customer signs up with us 
if we accelerate implementation of our network roll out or international activities  we may need to obtain additional financing earlier than anticipated 
we expect that we will need additional financing to fund our business plan  both domestically and internationally  which may include commercial bank borrowings  additional credit facilities or the sale or issuance of equity or debt securities either through one or more offerings or to one or more strategic investors 
such offerings may be at the parent company level or by one of our subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
because the cost of rolling out our networks and operating our business will depend on a variety of factors including our ability to meet our roll out schedules  our ability to negotiate favorable prices for purchases of network equipment  the number of customers and the services for which they subscribe  the nature and success of new services that we may offer  regulatory changes and changes in technology  actual costs and revenues may vary from expected amounts  possibly to a material degree  and such variations are likely to affect how much additional financing we will need 
further  the exact amount of our financial needs will depend upon other factors  including the cost to develop our networks in each of our market areas  the extent of competition and pricing of telecommunications services in our market areas  the acceptance of our services  the cost of acquiring complementary assets or businesses and the development of new products 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our actual financial needs will not exceed the anticipated amounts described above 
credit facilities on july   we entered into a credit agreement with the chase manhattan bank  goldman sachs credit partners  and toronto dominion bank  and other lenders  providing for credit facilities up to an aggregate of million million of which we do not expect to be available until the second half of the year contingent upon the satisfaction of a performance test 
the credit facilities will be used primarily for the purchase of telecommunications equipment  software and services and are also available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
availability of funds under the credit facilities is subject to certain conditions and compliance with covenants as described in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all our assets and certain of our subsidiaries assets 
the credit facilities are structured into three separate tranches consisting of a term loan facility  a delayed draw term loan facility and a revolving credit facility 
we have the ability to borrow funds over the next four years other than with respect to the delayed draw facility which converted on july  into a conversion term loan  with a final maturity of eight years 
interest accrues on outstanding borrowings based on a floating rate tied to the prevailing libor rate or an alternate base rate  and adjusts based on our attainment of certain key revenue and leverage benchmarks 
we incurred commitment and other fees in connection with obtaining the credit facilities totaling million  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over eight years 
as of december   we had a million outstanding loan balance under our credit facilities as a conversion term loan  and we may make additional draw downs this year 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to a incur or create additional debt  b enter into mergers or consolidations  c dispose of a significant amount of assets  d pay cash dividends  or e change the nature of our business 
we will also be subject to certain negative covenants  including covenants regarding the achievement of certain performance targets and the maintenance of certain financial ratios  that became applicable at the beginning of the third quarter of  and continue to be applicable 
in addition  the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances 
historical cash flows from january  through december   we used million of cash for operating activities and million of cash in our investing activities 
at december   we had working capital of million including unrestricted cash including cash equivalents of million  compared to working capital of million and cash of million at december  the increase in working capital is primarily a result of million of net proceeds received from the issuance of preferred stock  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable to vendors as we implement our growth strategy 
we will need a significant amount of cash to build our networks  market our services and cover operating expenditures 
although we anticipate our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with the credit facilities  will provide sufficient funds to carry out our current business plan into the year  our management continually evaluates potential financing options 
we also expect that current and future expansion and acquisitions will be financed from funds generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facilities  financing under the registration statement and potential additional financings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing  or financing on terms acceptable to us 
our total assets increased to  million at december   from million as of december   due primarily to receiving proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  borrowings under the credit facility and the acquisition of property and equipment which was accrued and will be paid in for the year ended december  we used cash in operations of million  due primarily to the operating loss for the period  partially offset by depreciation and amortization  stock based and other noncash compensation  and other charges 
we used cash in operations of million for the year ended december   due primarily to the operating loss for the period reduced by non cash stock based compensation and an increase in current liabilities during we used million of cash in investing activities in relating to the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of short term investments 
in  we used cash in investing activities of million  consisting primarily of million for the purchase of property and equipment  partially offset by million of interest received on the us treasury securities 
cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to million in  consisting primarily of million of net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  a million draw down of the credit facilities and the exercise of class a common stock options 
for  cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to million  consisting primarily of net proceeds from our senior discount notes offering  after costs of million 
subsequent event on february   the company and two of its stockholders entered into agreements to make major investments in icg  a fiber based communications company 
we expect to acquire approximately three million shares of icg stock in an all stock transaction in exchange for one million shares of teligent class a common stock 
teligent signed a memorandum with icg to negotiate an agreement that will enable us to explore opportunities to leverage many of icg s backbone facilities and other assets to extend the reach of our network  improve our network efficiency and reduce our network costs 
the closing of the icg transaction is subject to regulatory and stockholder approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions 
the icg transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have certain exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and other relevant market prices 
specifically  an increase or decrease in interest rates would affect interest costs relating to our credit facility 
at december   we had an outstanding loan balance of million under the credit facility  which incurs interest at a floating rate tied to a libor or an alternate base rate 
the outstanding balance under the credit facility represents approximately of our outstanding long term debt 
the company also maintains securities with an original maturity of greater than days  but less than one year 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates could have a material impact on the fair value of these financial instruments or on our short term investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates do not have a direct impact on interest expense relating to our remaining fixed rate long term debt  although the fair market value of our fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
if market rates declined  our interest payments could exceed those based on the current market rate 
we currently do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes  but may do so in the future
