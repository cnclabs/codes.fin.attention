item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of high quality polyester products  including fortrel brand polyester textile fibers  polyester fibers made from recycled raw materials and permaclear brand pet packaging resins 
in  the company had annual capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of fiber and billion pounds of resins worldwide at six major production facilities in the united states and europe 
see recent developments above and outlook below 
the company is also the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in its manufacturing operations 
the fibers group produces fortrel textile fibers  which currently represent approximately of the company s fiber production 
these fibers are used in apparel and home furnishings and are produced from two chemical raw materials  pta and meg 
the other of fiber production  primarily fiberfill and carpet fibers  is manufactured by the rpg from recycled raw materials  including postindustrial fiber  resin and film materials and postconsumer pet bottles 
the company s pet resins  produced by the ppg from pta and meg  are primarily used in the manufacture of clear plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the company s markets are highly competitive 
it competes in these markets primarily on the basis of product quality  customer service  brand identity and price 
it believes it is currently the largest polyester staple producer in the united states and the third largest pet resins producer in north america 
several of the company s competitors are substantially larger than the company and have substantially greater economic resources 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical  as it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports 
since late  the far east has been experiencing a significant economic and financial crisis 
this crisis has led to higher imports of polyester fiber  fabric and apparel  resulting in fiber price pressure in the united states and europe  which has adversely affected profitability 
global pet resins demand continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversions from other packaging materials to pet 
sales for pet resins  primarily for soft drink bottles and other beverages  may be influenced by weather 
the company s profitability is primarily determined by its raw material margins the difference between selling prices and raw material costs 
both fiber and resin raw material margins experience increases or decreases primarily based on selling price and raw material cost changes  which stem from supply and demand factors and competitive conditions 
given the company s substantial unit volumes  the impact on profitability of selling price and raw material cost changes are significant 
supply  demand  prices and raw material costs each may be affected by global economic and market conditions  export activity  and the prices of competing materials 
restructuring charges in an effort to offset in part the effects of lower selling prices and higher raw material costs in both its fiber and ppg groups and to improve long term profitability and stockholder returns  the company approved an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan in june as a result  the company recorded a pretax restructuring charge in of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
pursuant to the plan  the company closed its new york office and its wool business in johnsonville  sc during and began implementing other cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives throughout the company 
the restructuring  which is expected to be completed by the end of  will be funded from operating cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the accruals and changes in the accruals since the plan was adopted 
the company s cost reduction and productivity improvement plan adopted in is expected to generate planned annual pretax savings of approximately million  which began to phase in during the third quarter of and is expected to continue into see outlook below 
the savings associated with the cost reduction portion of the plan  expected to be approximately million compared to budgeted levels  will primarily result from lower costs for services  supplies and wages 
the expected savings are net of other continuing costs  such as fixed overhead  that the businesses have to absorb as a result of the restructuring 
the productivity improvement portion of the plan is expected to generate earnings of approximately million as pet resin market conditions improve 
this will be achieved through increased production volumes and lower annual costs by means of throughput and manufacturing improvements and operational efficiencies in production facilities 
cost reductions pursuant to the restructuring plan derived in the last half of are estimated to be approximately to million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a restructuring plan to consolidate and lower the overall operating costs of the business units in the rpg 
in connection with this plan  the company closed operations at a leased manufacturing facility in new jersey and a sales office in england 
the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share  in its fourth quarter earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the accruals and changes in the accruals since december  benefits derived in from the restructuring plan are estimated to be approximately million 
during the second quarter of  the company adopted a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and enhance the overall competitiveness of its european operations 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share  during its second quarter of the restructuring was completed during see results of operations compared to below for benefits derived from the restructuring 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of changes in the accruals since december  production outages in august  the company experienced production outages in its pet resin production process primarily resulting from an electrical failure 
in addition  the company s manufacturing facilities in the carolinas experienced reduced levels of production due to a hurricane in september the company estimates the total costs associated with these production outages to approximate million  of which million was recorded by the company as an insurance receivable for property damages in the third quarter of these additional costs increased the pretax loss during by approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share 
the company has business interruption insurance that it expects will mitigate a portion of unabsorbed costs and lost profits 
any proceeds from the business interruption claim will result in income in the period the claim is settled 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to total net sales for declined to million from million in this decrease was primarily the result of reductions in worldwide polyester fiber and pet resins selling prices and the reduced sales as a result of the businesses closed in the and restructurings 
net sales for the fibers group decreased to million from million in  principally due to a decline in the average selling price per pound of polyester fiber 
polyester fiber unit volumes remained essentially unchanged in compared to net sales for the rpg decreased to million from million in  primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower unit volumes for recycled polyester fiber  which declined and  respectively 
in addition  the rpg experienced a decline in net sales in other divisions as a result of the closure of a leased manufacturing facility in new jersey and significantly lower sales in the company s wool business 
see restructuring charges above 
net sales for the ppg increased to million in from million in due to a increase in pet resin unit volumes  reflecting the start up in the first half of of two new resin production lines 
the higher volumes more than offset a decline in the average selling price per pound of pet resin 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in this increase is due primarily to the aforementioned start up of two pet resin production lines and the production outages 
as a percentage of sales  however  cost of sales increased to in from in due to lower worldwide selling prices 
for the fibers group  cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased in compared to  primarily due to lower polyester fiber selling prices 
for the rpg  cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased in compared to due to lower worldwide fiber selling prices  offset in part by lower us recycled raw material costs 
for the ppg  cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased in compared to  resulting primarily from lower worldwide pet resins selling prices 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit declined to million in from million in the gross profit margin was in compared to in gross profit is primarily affected by raw material margins 
raw material margins for both fibers and resins dropped to historically low levels during  primarily due to reductions in selling prices occurring over the last few years 
the net cost of the company s chemical raw materials  pta and meg  increased during  primarily due to the increase in crude oil prices worldwide 
the selling price of chemical based fiber and pet resin could not be increased sufficiently to cover the raw material increase 
selling prices of recycled fiber declined more than the cost of domestic recycled fibers raw material and resulted in lower raw material margins for the company s domestic recycled fiber business 
in an effort to offset in part the effects of lower selling prices and higher raw material costs in both its fiber and ppg groups and to improve long term profitability and stockholder returns  the company approved an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan in june as a result  the company recorded a pretax restructuring charge in of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
see restructuring charges above 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in this decrease was primarily due to lower spending associated with the company s closed facilities and its cost reduction and productivity improvement plan  offset in part by discounts taken on accounts receivable sold 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported operating income of million  or 
of sales  for  compared to million  or of sales  in net interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to less capitalized interest in as the company commenced operation of two of three production lines at its pearl river facility in mississippi 
see outlook below for information with respect to the impact on interest expense expected in from the startup of the pearl river facility 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a pretax charge of million on the termination of a fixed rate financial instrument 
see results of operations compared to below 
the company s effective tax rate for was compared to for the rate has primarily been affected by the company incurring a loss in compared to income in and by the increase in the amount of nondeductible goodwill in as a result of the write off of goodwill associated with the closure of the company s wool business 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported a loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in of million  or per diluted share as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in excluding the production outages see production outages above  the restructuring charge see restructuring charges above  and the cumulative effect of accounting change  net earnings were million  or per diluted share 
this compares to million  or per diluted share  for  after excluding the restructuring charge  the lower of cost or market inventory adjustment and the loss on the fixed rate financial instrument 
effective january   the company adopted the aicpa s statement of position sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities  which required the company to begin expensing all start up and organization costs as incurred 
start up and organization costs incurred prior to the adoption of this sop have been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the effect of the change was to increase the net loss in by million million  less taxes of million  or per diluted share 
results of operations compared to total net sales for declined to million from billion in this decrease was primarily the result of reductions in worldwide polyester fiber selling prices as the crisis in the far east exerted intense price pressure on worldwide markets  the loss of sales of creative forming  inc cfi  which was sold in december  and a reduction in pet resin unit volumes in europe due to the modification of a take or pay supply contract in net sales for the fibers group decreased to million in from million in primarily due to an decline in the average selling price per pound of polyester fiber in compared to in addition  polyester fiber unit volumes declined in compared to net sales for the rpg decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of lower polyester fiber average selling prices  which declined in compared to  which was partially offset by a increase in unit volume 
in addition  in the rpg experienced a decline in net sales at other divisions 
sales for the ppg decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the divestiture of cfi  which had sales of million in  and a decrease in net sales in the pet resins business in europe  stemming from lower unit volumes in due to the modification of a take or pay supply contract in this decrease offset a increase in us pet resin unit volumes in compared to cost of sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower worldwide chemical raw material costs 
as a percentage of sales  however  cost of sales increased to in from in in addition  in the fourth quarter of  a pretax lower of cost or market inventory adjustment totaling million million after tax  or per diluted share  unfavorably impacted the cost of sales for the fibers group and ppg 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales for the fibers group increased in from  primarily due to lower fiber selling prices and lower production volumes  which were partially offset by lower chemical costs 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the rpg increased in compared to primarily due to higher us recycled raw material costs and lower worldwide fiber selling prices 
the company experienced lower production costs in its european operations in compared to as a result of the aforementioned restructuring plan 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the ppg decreased in from  primarily due to lower chemical raw material costs  which more than offset lower selling prices 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit declined to million in from million in the gross profit margin was in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of cfi and reduced costs at the company s european operations as a result of the restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a restructuring plan to consolidate and lower the overall operating costs of its recycling business 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share  in see restructuring charges above 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income declined to million in compared to million in net interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is due to higher interest capitalization resulting from the company s ongoing capital investment program 
in addition  the company incurred a pretax charge of million million after tax  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of on the termination of a fixed rate financial instrument 
this instrument was designed to provide a specified fixed year interest rate on a planned issuance of million of public fixed rate debt 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided more favorable financing was available and postponed its plan for public debt issuance and terminated the financial instrument 
the effective income tax rate was for compared to in the rate decreased primarily as a result of increased earnings at the company s irish recycled fiber operation  which is subject to significantly lower tax rates than the us operations  and the reduction in foreign operating losses for which no tax benefit had been provided 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in compared to million  or per diluted share  in excluding the inventory adjustment  the restructuring charge and the loss on the fixed rate financial instrument  net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in compared to earnings of million  or per diluted share  excluding the restructuring charge  a loss on the sale of a business  and a gain from insurance proceeds 
outlook the following statements are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below 
demand for pet packaging resin remains relatively strong 
the company believes continued growing demand may improve both selling price and profit margin in the first of two million pound resin production lines at the company s pearl river plant commenced production in january and the second line commenced in may as a result of these lines being in production an entire year and strong demand for pet resin  unit volumes are expected to increase significantly in a significant price increase has been announced for march  and additional price increases are expected later in recent increases in the price of oil are exerting upward price pressure on petrochemical feedstock 
management expects selling price increases to exceed raw material cost increases in however  given the competitive nature of the business and other market influences  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
each one cent per pound change in the company s pet resins margin has approximately a million effect on its pretax income 
the us and european fiber markets continue to be severely impacted by the far eastern imports of fiber  yarn  fabric and apparel from that region 
in the united states  high levels of asian imports are still present throughout the apparel textile chain 
although excess fiber supply continues to plague the industry  fiber shipments in the united states have shown signs of recovery  and inventories at the domestic fiber producer and fiber customer level are at reasonable levels 
as the business climate in asia improves  imports into the united states and europe may decline  and ongoing downward price pressure on fibers may abate 
the company is nearing the completion of construction of its million pound staple production line at its pearl river facility 
sales are expected to commence in the second quarter of this facility was designed to produce low cost  finer denier  higher tenacity staple fiber 
after the new staple production line is operating at planned levels  the company expects to take various staple lines at its other manufacturing facilities out of production for maintenance 
after the maintenance is completed  these lines will be returned to production when justified by business conditions 
the combined effect of the start up and maintenance is that the company s overall fiber production is expected to increase by to million pounds in the earnings associated with the increased revenue will be reduced by operating costs  including depreciation expense  at the pearl river facility  fixed costs related to nonproductive staple manufacturing equipment at other manufacturing facilities  and interest expense that was previously capitalized as part of the construction costs of the pearl river facility 
as a result of the cost reduction program implemented in  the company expects to achieve certain savings of approximately million in the year environmental matters the company s operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
the company takes a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to its manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
the company has identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations as well as to support planned future expansion 
the majority of the identified situations are found at the company s largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
the company s policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future env ironmental related expenditures  the company currently estimates its future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  the company has accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these accruals represent management s best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
the company believes that it is entitled to recover a portion of these expenditures under indemnification and escrow agreements 
during  and  net expenses associated with environmental remediation and ongoing assessment were not significant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the measurement of liability is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and takes into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information which becomes available 
the company believes it is either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or is operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties 
impact of year in late  the company completed its year remediation and testing of systems 
the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company expensed approximately million in connection with remediating its systems to make them year compliant 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services it receives from third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
transition to the euro although the euro was successfully introduced on january   the legacy currencies of those countries participating will continue to be used as legal tender through january  thereafter  the legacy currencies will be cancelled and euro bills and coins will be used in the eleven participating countries 
transition to the euro creates a number of issues for the company 
business issues that must be addressed include product pricing policies and ensuring the continuity of business and financial contracts 
finance and accounting issues include the conversion of accounting systems  statutory records  tax books and payroll systems to the euro  as well as conversion of bank accounts and other treasury and cash management activities 
the company continues to address these transition issues and does not expect the transition to the euro to have a significant effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
at wil  systems are compatible with the euro and its financial statements are prepared in euros 
the company expects to have its pet resins europe accounting systems  statutory reporting and tax books compatible with the euro by april capital resources and liquidity the company s overall cash needs for were provided from operations  asset securitizations  and long term borrowings 
net cash provided by operations was million for  including approximately million from an asset securitization program  compared to million for see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in capital spending amounted to million in and million in during  the company sold certain production equipment in connection with a sale and leaseback transaction 
the proceeds of million from the sale were used to pay down debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with the company nearing completion of its pearl river facility in mississippi  capital expenditures for are expected to be reduced to below million 
the company intends to use a substantial portion of its excess cash to pay down debt 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in net repayments of long term debt amounted to million in compared to million of net borrowings in in september  the company refinanced its million unsecured senior revolving credit facility 
the company s new million unsecured facility is comprised of a million day revolving credit facility day facility and a million four year revolving credit facility year facility and together the facilities 
the year facility  which matures in september  and the day facility have no scheduled principal repayments 
the company s financing agreements contain normal financial and restrictive covenants 
certain subsidiaries have guaranteed substantially all of the company s indebtedness for borrowed money 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the sec declared effective the company s universal shelf registration statement covering the issuance of up to million of debt and or equity securities 
no securities have been sold under this shelf registration 
subsequent to year end  the company obtained a million  senior unsecured note due february in conjunction with this financing  the company entered into two interest rate swaps  totaling million  which allows the company to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
interest differentials to be paid or received due to these swaps will be reflected as adjustments to interest expense over the related debt period 
the proceeds from the million senior unsecured debt were used to pay down other debt 
the financial resources available to the company at december  include million under the facilities  unused short term uncommitted lines of credit aggregating approximately million  the shelf registration  and internally generated funds 
based on its debt level as of december   the company could have had an average of approximately million of additional debt outstanding during the year without amending the terms of its debt agreements 
the company believes these financial resources and other credit arrangements will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends

forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  words such as believes  anticipates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company cautions that a number of important factors could cause actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
such statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  demand and competition for polyester fiber and pet resins  availability and cost of raw materials  levels of production capacity and announced changes to existing levels  changes in financial markets  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  work stoppages  natural disasters  us  european  far eastern and global economic conditions and changes in laws and regulations  prices of competing products  and the company s ability to complete expansions and other capital projects on time and budget and to maintain the operations of its existing production facilities 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to anticipate or respond timely to changes which could adversely affect its operating results in one or more fiscal quarters 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which the company is subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties which may be more significant to the company 
impact of economic conditions capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by its supply  is a critical factor affecting the company s financial performance 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical because it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both fiber and pet resins may be affected by global economic conditions 
worldwide supply is expanding for both fiber and resins 
any significant expansion in supply over demand could reduce profitability 
a material change in demand  supply or in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
impact of imports the us and european fiber markets and the european resin markets have experienced and been severely impacted by imports  principally from far eastern countries 
imports of fiber and fiber products caused an over supply which decreased fiber margins 
the price and volume of imports can significantly reduce the profitability of the company s businesses 
dependency on availability and cost of raw materials the company s operations are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of its two primary raw materials  pta and meg 
the company currently relies on a single source for the domestic supply of pta and a limited number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any of such sources  or a disruption in their business or failure to meet the company s product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
at a minimum  temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that precautions taken by the company would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
financial markets because the company s obligations under the facilities  bid loans and uncommitted lines of credit bear interest at floating rates  the company s earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
however  due to its purchase of interest rate swaps  the effect of interest rate changes is limited 
in addition  the company uses foreign currency debt and derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a material change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
environmental matters actual costs to be incurred for identified environmental situations in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company also utilizes a derivative financial instrument to manage its exposure to compensation expense under a supplemental employee retirement plan serp 
for additional discussion of the company s use of such instruments  see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because the company s obligations under the facilities  bid loans and uncommitted lines of credit bear interest at floating rates  the company s earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
however  due to its purchase of interest rate swaps  the effect of interest rate changes is limited 
a decrease in market interest rates from those at december  and that affect the company s financial instruments would reduce income before income taxes by approximately million and reduce cash flow from operations by million for both years ended december  and the potential decrease in fair value of all financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical shift in interest rates from december  and would be approximately million at december  and million at december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
foreign currency risk the company uses foreign currency debt and derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments primarily denominated in dutch guilders are specifically used to reduce the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments for its pet resins business in the netherlands  to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations relative to fixed asset purchase commitments  and to hedge certain accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december  and would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in fair value of the company s underlying exposure 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices 
equity risk the company also uses an equity linked investment to hedge its exposure to compensation expense to a serp 
this equity linked investment  the value of which fluctuates based on the market price of the company s stock  is marked to market  and gains or losses are recognized as an offset to compensation expense related to the serp 
a decrease in the market value of the company s stock would not materially affect the fair value of the equity linked investment at december  and
