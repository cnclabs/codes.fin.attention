item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis compares the year ended december  to the year ended december  and the year ended december  to the year ended december  consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview since  the company has pursued an aggressive growth strategy  increasing its number of equipment rental and sales locations to  as of december  the company has achieved this growth through the addition of equipment rental locations as a result of acquisitions  and the opening of start up equipment rental locations primarily throughout the southeast and southwest regions of the united states 
the company intends to continue to pursue its aggressive growth strategy by i making additional acquisitions of equipment rental companies  ii increasing fleet at its existing equipment rental locations in both existing and new product lines  iii continuing to open new equipment rental locations 
since march   the company has opened start up rental equipment locations 
management believes the company s recent financial performance does not fully reflect the benefit of these rental locations 
based on the company s historical experience  a new equipment rental location tends to incur costs during the early period of operations without the benefit of the revenue stream of a mature location 
new rental locations realize significant increases in revenues and cash flow during the first three years of operation  and generally become profitable in the third year of operation as more equipment is added to the rental fleet and as the location matures 
because there is relatively little incremental operating expense associated with such revenues  there is a greater proportionate increase in cash flow and profitability as a rental location matures 
the company believes the revenues  cash flow and profitability of the start up locations opened since march  will increase significantly as these locations mature 
the company primarily derives revenue from i the rental of equipment  ii sales of new and used equipment and iii sales of parts and service 
the company s primary source of revenue is the rental of equipment to construction and industrial customers 
growth in rental revenue is dependent upon several factors  including the demand for rental equipment  the amount of equipment available for rent  rental rates and the general economic environment 
the level of new and used equipment sales is primarily a function of the supply and demand for such equipment  price and general economic conditions 
the age  quality and mix of the company s rental fleet also affect revenues from the sale of used equipment 
revenues derived from the sale of parts and service is generally correlated with sales of new equipment 
costs of revenues include cost of equipment sold  depreciation and maintenance costs of rental equipment and cost of parts and service 
cost of equipment sold consists of the net book value of rental equipment at the time of sale and cost for new equipment sales 
depreciation of rental equipment represents the depreciation costs attributable to rental equipment 
maintenance of rental equipment represents the costs of servicing and maintaining rental equipment on an ongoing basis 
cost of parts and service represents costs attributable to the sale of parts directly to customers and service provided for the repair of customer owned equipment 
depreciation of rental equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated service life of the asset generally two to eight years with a residual value 
since january   the company has  from time to time  made certain changes to its depreciation assumptions to recognize extended estimated service lives and increased residual values of its rental equipment 
the company believes that these changes in estimates will more appropriately reflect its financial results by better allocating the cost of its rental equipment over the service lives of these assets 
in addition  the new lives and residual values more closely conform to those prevalent in the industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing expenses  payroll and related costs  professional fees  property and other taxes and other administrative overhead 
other depreciation and amortization represents the depreciation associated with property and equipment other than rental equipment and the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
results of operations in view of the company s growth  management believes that the period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the company s results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future as a result of the cyclical nature of the industry in which the company operates 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information derived from the consolidated statements of operations of the company expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
there can be no assurance that the trends in the table below will continue in the future

liquidity and capital resources during  the company completed an initial public offering of its class a common stock the offering and the sale of million of senior subordinated notes due the senior notes to reduce the company s indebtedness  extend its debt maturities to reflect the long term nature of its assets and provide increased operational and financial flexibility to allow the company to pursue its growth strategy 
proceeds from the offering and senior notes were used to repay a million term loan  redeem the company s series a cumulative preferred stock  repay a mortgage related to properties the company owns and reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
during  the company s operating activities provided net cash flow of million as compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to the growth in the company s operations resulting from an increase in the number of rental locations operated by the company 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million for as compared to million in the same period for the prior year 
the change in cash from investing activities was due to sales of subsidiaries and decreased acquisitions in net cash provided by used in financing activities was million for as compared to million for the net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to net borrowings made under the company s revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had approximately million available under its revolving credit facility 
based upon current expectations  the company believes that cash flow from operations  together with amounts  which may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  will be adequate for it to meet its capital requirements and pursue its business strategy for the next months 
inflation and general economic conditions although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on its results of operations 
the company s operating results may be adversely affected by events or conditions in a particular region  such as regional economic  weather and other factors 
in addition  the company s operating results may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates that may lead to a decline in economic activity  while simultaneously resulting in higher interest payments by the company under its variable rate credit facilities 
although much of the company s business is with customers in industries that are cyclical in nature  management believes that certain characteristics of the equipment rental industry and the company s operating strategies should help to mitigate the effects of an economic downturn 
these characteristics include i the flexibility and low cost offered to customers by renting  which may be a more attractive alternative to capital purchases  ii the company s ability to redeploy equipment during regional recessions  and iii the diversity of the company s industry and customer base 
market risk the company s financial instruments consist of cash  accounts receivable  and debt 
cash and accounts receivable are short term  non interest bearing instruments and not subject to market risk 
for fixed rate debt instruments  interest rate changes affect their fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt instruments  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding debt levels constant  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and decrease earnings and cash flows for variable rate debt by approximately million
