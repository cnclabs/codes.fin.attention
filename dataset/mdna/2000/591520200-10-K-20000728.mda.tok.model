item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s business is managed on a technology product basis  with those technology segments being electronic  optical subsystems and components and other 
the business units whose results are identified in the electronic segment principally employ electronic processes to control and convey signals 
the business units whose results are identified in the optical subsystems and components segment principally employ light to control and convey signals 
the other segment includes manufacturers of multi layer printed circuit boards and bus systems as well as independent laboratories which provide services for qualification testing and certification of electronic and optical components 
the company exited the printed circuit business in september  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  substantially all of the optical subsystems and components segment was transferred to the company s newly formed subsidiary  stratos lightwave  inc stratos  effective may  on june   stratos issued shares of common stock in an initial public offering 
the company owns of stratos common stock outstanding 
it is the company s intention to distribute  at a later date  all of the shares of stratos common stock it owns to its stockholders contingent upon receiving a ruling from the internal revenue service that such a distribution would be tax free to the company and its stockholders 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated the year ended april  income net sales settlement of litigation other costs and expenses cost of products sold selling and administrative expenses provision for exiting printed circuit business amortization of intangibles interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal years ended april  and net sales 
consolidated net sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of the electronic segment  which represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal and in fiscal  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sales to the automotive industry  which represented and of electronic segment net sales in and  grew by in fiscal this increase was offset by a sales decrease at our singapore connector facility  a sales decrease at our terminator and cable assembly facility in ireland and a decrease in net sales of our datamate products 
net sales of the optical subsystems and components segment represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal and of consolidated net sales in fiscal optical subsystems and components segment net sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal of this  increase   is from an increase in net sales of optical subsystems and  is from an increase in net sales of optical components 
the increase in net sales of optical subsystems was primarily due to an increase in sales of stratos line of internal removable transceivers 
net sales of the other segment  principally current carrying bus devices  printed circuit boards and test laboratories  declined to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the company exited the printed circuit board business in fiscal which resulted in a decrease in printed circuit board net sales of  net sales of current carrying bus devices increased  and test laboratory net sales increased modestly in fiscal settlement of litigation 
income from the settlement of litigation in fiscal represented the settlement of a claim relative to one of the company s patents in the electronic segment 
other income 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from the company s automotive joint venture  license fees and royalties and interest income on short term investments 
the increase in other income in fiscal was primarily the result of a  increase in license fees related to stratos optoelectronic patents 
license fees consist of both fixed schedule payments and contingent payments based on sales volumes of licensed products 
cost of sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal gross margins of the electronic segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margins on sales to the automotive industry were flat from year to year 
our singapore connector facility  our terminator and cable assembly facility in ireland and our datamate facility all reported decreased gross margins due to sales volume declines in fiscal gross margins of the optical subsystems and components segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal cost of sales includes an increase of approximately  in material and overhead costs related to major product development projects and approximately  of additional personnel costs dedicated to research and development 
fiscal also included start up and unusual expenses related to stratos recently acquired stratos micro systems and bandwidth semiconductor subsidiaries 
the optical subsystems and components segment also experienced declines in the average unit prices for its products 
gross margins of the other segment improved to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement was primarily the result of exiting the printed circuit business 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal and in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increased provision for bad debts of  and increased staff costs incurred to support stratos growing optical subsystem business 
provision for exiting printed circuit business 
the  provision for exiting printed circuit business in represents the estimated loss on disposal of assets  employee severance pay and additional costs associated with environmental matters specifically related to the decision to exit the business 
operating losses that were incurred in the first half of fiscal to wind down these business were not material and were recorded as incurred 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates were in fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rates for both years reflect the effects of lower tax rates from foreign operations  offset in part  by state income taxes 
fiscal years ended april  and net sales 
consolidated net sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of the electronic segment  which represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal and in fiscal  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sales to the automotive industry  which represented and of the electronic segment net sales in and  grew by in fiscal this increase was offset by a sales decrease of our non automotive interconnect devices led by a decrease in net sales of our datamate products 
net sales of the optical subsystems and components segment represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal and of consolidated net sales in fiscal optical subsystems and components segment net sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal of this  increase   is from an increase in net sales of optical subsystems and  is from an increase in net sales of optical components 
the increase in net sales of optical subsystems was primarily due to an increase in sales of stratos embedded transceivers 
net sales of the other segment  principally current carrying bus devices  printed circuit boards and test laboratories  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of current carrying bus devices increased  and test laboratory net sales increased  in fiscal these sales gains were largely offset by a decline of printed circuit board sales of  settlement of litigation 
income from the settlement of litigation in fiscal represented the settlement of a claim relative to one of the company s patents in the electronic segment 
other income 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from the company s automotive joint venture  license fees and royalties  interest income on short term investments  and in fiscal  an approximate  gain from the sale of a building 
cost of sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal gross margins of the electronic segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross margin decline in was largely due to margin erosion on sales to the automotive industry caused by product mix changes  additional infrastructure and engineering costs incurred for new programs not yet producing revenue and customer requested piece part sales price reductions 
gross margins of the optical subsystems and components segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due primarily to a positive shift in product mix between higher margin optical subsystems and lower margin optical components 
the effect of this shift on margins was partially offset by an increase of  in personnel costs related to research and development and  in project related material and overhead costs 
gross margins of the other segment declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the margin decline was primarily the result of operating losses at our printed circuit board facilities and a  provision for environmental clean up costs at these facilities 
provision for exiting printed circuit business 
the  for exiting printed circuit business in represents the estimated loss on disposal of assets  employee severance pay and additional costs associated with environmental matters specifically related to the decision to exit the business 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively flat at in fiscal and fiscal  as staff costs increased to support stratos growing optical subsystem business 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates were in fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rates for both years reflect the effects of lower tax rates from foreign operations  offset in part  by state income taxes 
the effective rate for fiscal was lower than fiscal due to the effects of a substantially tax free gain on the sale of a building 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was   and  in  and the increase in cash provided by operations in was primarily the result of accelerated collection of accounts receivable that included substantial amounts related to automotive tooling programs 
the decrease in cash provided from operations in was primarily the result of lower net income and increased working capital requirements to support increased sales 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company purchased selected assets of spire corporation s optoelectronic business segment bandwidth semiconductor for cash of approximately  this acquisition provided the company with established capabilities in research and development into formulating optoelectronically active semiconductors for expanded bandwidth applications 
this acquisition was funded by internally generated funds 
the company used a total of  of cash in fiscal to acquire polycore technologies stratos micro systems  a developer of highly integrated data communication modules for local area network equipment  stratos  ltd  a developer and manufacturer of expanded beam fiber optic connectivity products for harsh environments and an additional of optokon  a fiber optic connector company  from a former joint venture partner 
in connection with the fiscal acquisition of adam technologies  a designer and marketer of electrical and electronic connectors  the company made cash payments of  in   in and  in fiscal using available cash 
bandwidth semiconductor  stratos micro systems and stratos  ltd 
were included in the may  transfer to stratos 
during fiscal the company used  of its available cash to acquire  shares of its common stock for treasury 
the purchases of these shares were made pursuant to a three year common stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in february depreciation and amortization expense was   and  in  and capital expenditures were   and  in  and principal capital investments involved the purchase of a  square foot clean room oriented facility to house the company s stratos micro systems subsidiary in fiscal  the expansion of the automotive manufacturing and test laboratory facilities and purchase of machinery and equipment to support the increasing sales volume of optical subsystems and products for the automotive industry in and purchase of new facilities for an independent test laboratory and our cable assembly operations in capital expenditures in  and were funded from operating cash flows 
it is anticipated that capital acquisitions for will also be funded from operating cash flows 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in june  the company s newly formed subsidiary  stratos lightwave  inc raised  in cash in an initial public offering ipo of of its common stock 
the proceeds from this ipo are available only to stratos and will be used to pay  of additional purchase price in connection with the acquisition of stratos micro systems  and for general corporate purposes 
impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late calendar  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company expensed approximately  in connection with remediating its systems 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
euro conversion on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro is now trading on currency exchanges and may be used in certain transactions such as electronic payments 
beginning in january  new euro denominated notes and coins will be used  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the conversion to the euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions between the member countries  which for the company primarily consists of sales to certain customers and payments to certain suppliers 
the company is currently addressing the issues involved with the new currency  which include converting information technology systems  recalculating currency risk  and revising processes for preparing accounting and taxation records 
the company does not believe the euro conversion will have a significant impact on the results of its operations or cash flows 
cautionary statement certain statements in this report are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s business is highly dependent upon specific makes and models of automobiles 
therefore  the company s financial results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive industry  such as general economic conditions  interest rates and consumer spending patterns 
a significant portion of the balance of the company s business relates to the computer and telecommunication industries which are subject to many of the same risks facing the automotive industry as well as fast moving technological change 
other factors which may result in materially different results for future periods include actual growth in the company s various markets  operating costs  currency exchange rates and devaluations  delays in development  production and marketing of new products  and other factors set forth from time to time in the company s form k and other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
any of these factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements in this report are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided under the securities law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk although certain of the company s subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  foreign currency exposures arising from these transactions are not material to the company 
the primary foreign currency exposure arises from the translation of the company s net equity investment in its foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
the company generally views as long term its investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed are the singapore dollar  maltese lira and other european currencies 
the fair value of the company s net foreign investments would not be materially affected by a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from april  levels
