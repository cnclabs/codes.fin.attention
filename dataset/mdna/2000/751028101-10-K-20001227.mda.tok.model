item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of ralcorp holdings  inc company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under item  especially note  and the cautionary statement on forward looking statements on page significant changes to the company s business mix and nonrecurring events that have been recorded over the last three years affect the comparisons of fiscal  and operations 
as a result  comparative results are more difficult to analyze and explain 
where practicable  this discussion attempts to address not only the financial results as reported  but also the key results and factors affecting ralcorp s on going businesses 
results of operations cereals  crackers cookies fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment were up million in fiscal from fiscal this increase was due to the additional revenue acquired through the current year purchases of ripon foods  inc and cascade cookie company  inc  which are operated as part of bremner  ralcorp s cracker and cookie division 
ripon foods  a cookie  sugar wafer and breakfast bar producer  was acquired on october   and cascade  which produces cookies for in store bakeries  was acquired on january  comparing the pre existing bremner cracker and cookie businesses to the prior year  volumes were down percent  primarily as a result of certain lower margin cracker category declines 
the company s ready to eat rte and hot cereal division  ralston foods  recorded decreased sales for the year ended september  compared to the prior year  principally due to lower volumes 
the primary factor in the volume decline was the reduction of volume related to the termination of a cereal co manufacturing agreement on december   a portion of which was replaced late in the year 
in addition  hot cereal volume was down percent from last year compared to a corresponding percent year over year increase in fiscal despite an industry decline in the overall rte cereal category  ralston foods base store brand rte cereal volume for fiscal was flat compared to the prior year 
ralston foods remains very active in its efforts to increase volume via other co manufacturing opportunities  increased distribution and new product emulations 
from an operating results perspective  the cereals  crackers cookies segment recorded fiscal operating profit up million from the prior year 
bremner operating profit improved due to the good performance of the cookie businesses acquired during the current year  as well as favorable raw material costs and production efficiencies in the pre existing cracker operations which more than offset the decline in net sales 
bremner s operating profit improvements were partially offset by declines at ralston foods 
while operating results were hurt at ralston foods by the aforementioned loss of co manufacturing business and the resulting unfavorable effect on plant efficiencies  a significant portion of this unfavorability was offset by a reduction in managed costs 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment improved million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal both the ralston foods store brand cereal division and the bremner store brand cracker and cookie operation contributed to this growth 
volume improvements in both ready to eat and hot cereal and a slightly improved product mix were the key factors driving the ralston foods sales increase 
ready to eat cereal volume increased percent in a flat to slightly down category  and hot cereal volume grew percent for fiscal sales revenue increases at bremner can be primarily attributed to the benefit of a full year of sales from sugar kake cookie inc  which was acquired in august volumes for the pre existing cracker and cookie operation excluding sugar kake  which were adversely affected by the aggressive promotional activity of large branded product manufacturers  declined percent for fiscal as volume gains in cookies were more than offset by volume declines in crackers 
from an operating results perspective  the cereals  crackers cookies segment recorded an improvement of percent from fiscal to fiscal ralston foods operating profit benefited primarily from ready to eat and hot cereal volume gains  a slight product mix improvement  favorable material costs  and continued operational cost containment 
bremner s operating profit improved due to the addition of sugar kake s volume and operating profit for the full fiscal period 
in addition  the bremner operation benefited from lower ingredient costs  improved production efficiencies  which greatly improved yields  and an improved product mix 
snack nuts candy net sales for the snack nuts candy segment have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and in fiscal  largely due to the timing of the acquisitions 
ralcorp s first snack nut business  flavor house products  inc  was acquired on april  and nutcracker brands  inc was acquired in early september southern roasted nuts of georgia  inc  was acquired at the end of march  but the georgia facility was closed at the end of april to consolidate the operations of the three snack nut businesses into two locations at billerica  ma and dothan  al 
finally  james p 
linette  inc  a chocolate candy manufacturer  was acquired on may  in addition to the rapid growth through acquisitions  the segment has continued to improve its volume and customer base 
the segment s operating profit increased from 
million of net sales in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal most of the dollar increase from year to year is attributable to the timing of acquisitions  as discussed above 
however  operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved significantly from to as the segment benefited from increasing scale 
the percentages in and were also negatively affected by a sharp increase in the cost of cashews due to a worldwide shortage of this commodity 
while the management of this segment took steps to mitigate the impact of these higher costs  such steps could not fully offset the lower operating margins 
finally  the percentage in fiscal was negatively impacted by increased labor costs due to initial inefficiencies related to the moving of production lines from the georgia plant to the other facilities 
dressings  syrups  jellies sauces the company s dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment  also known as the carriage house companies  inc  is comprised of martin gillet co  inc  acquired at the beginning of march  and the red wing company  inc  acquired on july  the segment s net sales and operating profit for the year ended september  increased significantly from the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the timing of the acquisitions as noted above  whereby fiscal included only seven months of results from martin gillet and fiscal includes martin gillet s results for the full year and two and a half months of results from red wing 
carriage house has struggled to regain sales lost by red wing during the previous owner s operation and has incurred incremental expenses associated with combining red wing and martin gillet 
the company s plan to close the baltimore facility and move production to the dunkirk facility by january is proceeding on schedule 
pro forma net sales for this segment  assuming red wing had been acquired at the beginning of fiscal  were approximately million 
baby foods ralcorp sold its branded baby food subsidiary  beech nut nutrition corporation beech nut on september  see note in item 
the results of beech nut operations are included in the company s consolidated operating results through that date 
consolidated net sales net sales grew from in fiscal to in and in the increase from to and the increase from to were due primarily to business acquisitions 
refer to the segment discussions above for specific factors affecting these historical results 
operating expenses the following table shows operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
year ended september  net sales cost of products sold selling  general and administrative sg a advertising and promotion a p earnings before interest  restructuring  gain on sale  income taxes and equity earnings as noted above  the results of beech nut are included for almost all of fiscal that branded business had significantly higher gross margins ie  lower cost of products sold percentage  a p costs and other operating expenses than the continuing and subsequently acquired private label businesses 
consequently  the percentage of sales figures changed notably from to furthermore  as acquisitions have continued to change the company s business mix  the percentage of sales figures have changed  reflecting the lower gross margin and operating cost structure of the snack nuts candy and dressings  syrups  jellies sauces businesses 
the three year gross margin trend was also affected by the temporary ingredient and labor cost increases within the snack nuts operation 
in addition  the declining trend in sg a expenses can be partially attributed to the ability of the cereals  crackers cookies operations to grow their revenue bases while keeping fixed costs relatively flat 
all considered  the percentage for cost of products sold is expected to level off  the rate of decline in the sg a percentage is expected to slow  and the a p percentage is expected to remain at 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased from zero in fiscal to million in and million in  reflecting the company s increasing debt level 
the company remained essentially debt free throughout fiscal as the purchase prices of acquired businesses were funded by available cash from operations and the proceeds from the sale of beech nut 
long term debt increased to million by the end of fiscal and to million by september   primarily as a result of business acquisitions 
most of the increase occurred near the end of fiscal with the acquisition of red wing  so interest expense is expected to be higher in fiscal restructuring charge on july   the company announced its plan to close the baltimore  md plant of its dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment and move production to its dunkirk  ny facility 
in conjunction with this plan  the company recorded charges in the fourth quarter in the amount of million million after taxes  or 
per share related to termination benefits for production employees and administrative employees and a write down of assets to be sold 
the land  building and equipment which will not be transferred to dunkirk were written down to approximately million to reflect their estimated realizable value net of selling expenses 
none of these charges were utilized in fiscal but are expected to be fully utilized by the end of the fiscal year gain on sale of beech nut the sale of beech nut in fiscal resulted in a gain of million million after taxes 
income taxes income tax provisions generally reflect statutory tax rates for each of the fiscal years 
equity in earnings of vail resorts  inc 
the company recorded pre tax equity earnings of million in fiscal  which includes the company s portion of vail s operating results for only the period of october through july due to the timing of a change in vail s fiscal year end 
for fiscal  the company s pre tax earnings from vail were only million 
this decrease is the result of not only the inclusion of the unprofitable ski months of august and september  but also low snowfall during the peak ski season and an incident of arson 
the company s pre tax equity earnings improved to million for fiscal  primarily as a result of the inclusion of expected net proceeds from a reduced skier day insurance policy claim related to its second fiscal quarter  which was hurt by both poor early season snowfall and a significant decline in vacation travel around the new years holiday due to yk concerns 
liquidity and capital resources the company s businesses have historically focused on generating positive cash flows through operations 
management believes that the company will continue to generate operating cash flows through its mix of businesses and expects that short term and long term liquidity requirements will be met through a combination of operating cash flows and strategic use of borrowings under committed and uncommitted credit arrangements 
capital resources remained strong at september  with a net worth of million and a long term debt to total capital ratio of percent 
cash flows from operations cash flows from operations have been fairly steady in the past three years with million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating cash flows are primarily affected by cash earnings and changes in working capital 
cash earnings net earnings before depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  equity earnings and other noncash items have been growing along with the company  from million in to million in and million in from a cash flow standpoint  this growth in cash earnings has been offset by successively larger increases in working capital  excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures  of million in  million in and million in much of this large fiscal increase is the result of a normal seasonal inventory build up at red wing s tomato paste production facility which occurred after the acquisition of red wing 
working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was million at september  compared to million and million at september  and  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities net cash paid for business acquisitions totaled million in fiscal ripon foods  cascade  linette 
and red wing  million in fiscal martin gillet and southern roasted nuts  and million in fiscal flavor house  sugar kake and nutcracker 
net proceeds from the sale of beech nut in were million 
see note of item for more information about acquisitions and divestitures 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to increase to approximately million  primarily as a result of the recently acquired businesses 
cash flows from financing activities net borrowings during fiscal were million  compared to million and zero in fiscal and  respectively 
these borrowings closely follow the company s acquisition and divestiture activity discussed above  note that the total net cash paid for acquisitions during the past three years  net of the proceeds from the sale of beech nut  was million  while long term debt outstanding at september  was million 
of that outstanding balance  only million uncommitted credit arrangements is required to be repaid during fiscal another million matures on april  unless such date is extended  at the company s option  for an additional nine months 
both of these amounts were classified as long term debt based on management s ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis see note in item 
as of september   million of the company s committed credit facilities was unused 
in addition  the unused portion of uncommitted credit arrangements with banks was over million 
further cash needs could be met through the sale of the company s investment in vail resorts  inc  which had a market value of million at september  the company repurchased million  million and million of its common stock during fiscal  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company s board of directors approved an authorization to buy back up to two million shares of the company s common stock from time to time as management determines 
as of september    shares remained available for repurchase by the company pursuant to that authorization 
outlook cereals  crackers cookies the level of competition in the cereal category continues to be very intense 
competition comes from branded box cereal manufacturers  branded bagged cereal producers and other private label cereal providers 
for the last several years  the overall category has not recorded any meaningful growth  which has only added to the competitive nature 
when the competition focuses on price promotion  the environment for private label producers becomes more challenging 
ralston foods must maintain an effective price gap between its quality private label cereal products and those of branded cereal producers  thereby providing the best value alternative for the consumer 
increased distribution  including new co manufacturing opportunities  new product emulations and aggressive cost containment remain important goals of the organization 
the company s cracker and cookie operation  bremner  also conducts business in a very competitive category 
major branded competitors continue to aggressively market and promote their offerings and many smaller  regional participants provide additional competitive pressures 
during fiscal  two large branded competitors announced that they had been acquired by even larger organizations  which may add to the competitive environment 
bremner s ability to successfully respond to changing market conditions and to realize improved operating efficiencies from recent acquisitions will be important to its results of operations 
in addition  bremner will continue to focus on cost containment  new products and volume growth of existing products in order to improve operating results 
snack nuts candy the outlook for the snack nuts candy segment remains favorable  as the snack nut category leader continues to drive growth in this snack food segment 
cashew costs are trending down from significant highs and the company has completed its consolidation of three snack nut operations down to two plants  which should improve the segment s profitability 
the addition of chocolate candy capability through the acquisition of linette has increased the scope of products offered by the segment 
from an operation perspective  the segment will continue to focus on fully leveraging the combined strengths of all of its operations  growing its customer base and maintaining the quality of its products 
dressings  syrups  jellies sauces the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces operation the combination of red wing and martin gillet  now referred to as carriage house starts fiscal in the middle of major operational changes 
the consolidation of its baltimore operation into the dunkirk facility  which is an important opportunity to capture synergies of the original two companies  is progressing on schedule 
when completed in january  this change will result in significant operational benefits to carriage house in the future 
in addition  carriage house plans to improve performance by increasing sales to new and existing customers by expanding product offerings and integrating the martin gillet and red wing sales efforts 
cost containment and the capturing of additional synergies of the two organizations will also be critical objectives 
overall the company s management believes that the opportunities in the private label and value brand areas are favorable for long term growth 
the company has taken significant steps to reshape the company and lessen its reliance on any one business segment and to achieve sufficient scale in the categories in which it operates 
management expects to continue to improve its business mix through volume and profit growth of existing businesses  as well as through key acquisitions or alliances 
management will continue to explore those acquisition opportunities that strategically fit with the company s intentions of being the premier provider of private label  or value oriented  food products 
on august   the company and agribrands international  inc agribrands entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization agreement  which set forth the terms and conditions of a proposed merger of equals of the two companies 
on december   the agreement was terminated by agribrands 
in accordance with the agreement  the company received a payment of million as a termination fee 
this termination fee income will be recorded net of related expenses in the first quarter of fiscal although access to agribrands cash reserves and cash flow would have given ralcorp the opportunity to make more or larger acquisitions within a shorter time frame  ralcorp still has substantial acquisition capital available from unused debt capacity and its investment in vail resorts  inc inflation management recognizes that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on the company through higher asset replacement costs  related depreciation and higher material costs 
the company tries to minimize these effects through cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable profit margins 
it is management s view  however  that inflation has not had a significant impact on operations in the three years ended september  recently issued accounting standards see note of item for a discussion regarding recently issued accounting standards  including sop  fas  sab  and eitf and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials 
the company utilized derivative financial instruments  including futures contracts and options  to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so 
as of september  and  a hypothetical adverse change in the market price of the company s principal commodities  including corn  oats  wheat and soybean oil  would have decreased the fair value of the company s derivatives portfolio by 
million and 
million  respectively 
this volatility analysis ignores changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged transactions 
because the company does not hold or trade derivatives for speculation or profit  all changes in derivative values are effectively offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures
