item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers and suppliers throughout the contiguous united states  alaska  the district of columbia and western and central canada 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth and constant emphasis on the development of its consolidated buying programs 
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
sysco s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
sysco s operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions fitting within the company s overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations is applied toward a portion of the cost of shares repurchased in the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt 
sysco s initial share repurchase program was used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans 
the company significantly accelerated the repurchase program beginning in february the share repurchase program reduces outstanding shares and increases earnings per share 
the long term debt to total capitalization target ratio was increased from a range of to to a range of to due to prior and anticipated accelerated share repurchases  additional debt associated with those repurchases and acquisitions 
this ratio was and at july  and july   respectively 
in november  the board authorized an additional  share buyback to be completed in calendar and in july  authorized an additional  share buyback to be completed in fiscal  and in september the board authorized an additional  share buyback to be completed in calendar  and in july the board authorized a new  share buyback 
the number of shares acquired and their cost for the past three years was  shares for  in fiscal   shares for  in fiscal and  shares for  in fiscal in february  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions 
as of july  all of these shares are available for issuance 
net cash generated from operating activities was  in   in and  in expenditures for facilities  fleet and other equipment were  in   in and  in expenditures in fiscal should be in the range of  to  on june  sysco filed with the securities and exchange commission a  shelf registration of debt securities 
on july  sysco issued debentures totaling  under the shelf registration  due august  these debentures were priced at of par  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco the right to retire the debentures at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the debenture holders are not penalized by the early redemption 
proceeds from the debentures were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper 
the net cash provided by operations less cash utilized for capital expenditures  the share repurchase program  cash dividends and other uses resulted in net long term debt of  at july  about of the long term debt is at fixed rates averaging and the remainder is at floating rates averaging 
long term debt to capitalization was at july   down from the at july  and down from the at june  sysco continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate 
sysco has uncommitted bank lines of credit  which provide for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to  of which  and  were outstanding at july  and july   respectively 
sysco has a commercial paper program which is currently supported by a  bank credit facility 
during fiscal  and  commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately  to  from approximately  to  and from approximately  to  respectively 
in summary  sysco believes that through continual monitoring and management of assets together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets  it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 
market risk sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and holds no derivative financial instruments which could expose the company to significant market risk 
sysco s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term obligations discussed above 
at july  the company had outstanding commercial paper of  with maturities through september  the company s remaining long term debt obligations of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest 
sysco has no significant cash flow exposure due to interest rate changes for long term debt obligations 
sales the annual increases in sales of in and in weeks resulted from several factors 
sales in fiscal and were affected by the strong growth in the us economy  as well as in the foodservice industry 
after adjusting for food price increases  acquisitions and adjusted for the extra week in fiscal  real sales growth was about in and in acquisitions represented of total sales for fiscal food costs  which experienced minimal inflation during the first two quarters of and a slight deflation during the third quarter  returned to about inflation during the final quarter  resulting in approximately inflation for fiscal this compares to an increase of approximately in fiscal industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real growth of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year sales for fiscal through were as follows fiscal year sales increase weeks  a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below medical supplies dairy products fresh and frozen meats seafoods poultry frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other canned and dry products paper and disposables janitorial products equipment and smallwares fresh produce beverage products a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other cost of sales cost of sales increased about in and in these increases were generally in line with the increases in sales 
the rate of increase is influenced by sysco s overall customer and product mix as well as economies realized in product acquisition and higher sales of sysco brand products 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling and administrative expenses 
these expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal and for fiscal and for fiscal part of the increase over was due to expenses related to the closing of a facility and one time non recurring costs associated with the completion of the sysco uniform systems implementation 
there was also a charge to non operating expenses in connection with the facility closing 
the costs described above were approximately  otherwise  changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several economic influences  including customer mix 
inflationary increases in operating costs generally have been offset through improved productivity 
interest expense interest expense decreased  or approximately in fiscal as compared to an increase of  or approximately in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to interest income received in the amount of  related to a federal income tax refund on an amended tax return 
without this income  interest expense would have been approximately above last year due to increased borrowings 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increased borrowings  principally to fund the share repurchase program  and the replacement of floating rate debt at higher fixed rates 
interest capitalized during the past three years was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal other  net other decreased  or about in fiscal and decreased  or about  in fiscal changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities as well as the expenses related to the facility closing discussed under operating expenses above 
earnings before income taxes earnings before income taxes rose  or approximately  above fiscal which had increased  or approximately  over the prior year 
additional sales and realization of operating efficiencies contributed to the increases as well as the company s success in its continued efforts to increase sales to the company s higher margin marketing associate served customers and increasingly higher sales of sysco brand products 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was and for was approximately earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change fiscal represents the twenty fourth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change rose  or approximately  above fiscal which had increased  or approximately  over the prior year 
cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal  sysco recorded a one time  after tax  non cash charge of  to comply with the required adoption of aicpa statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires the write off of any unamortized costs of start up activities and organization costs 
going forward such costs are being expensed as incurred 
net earnings net earnings for the year increased  or approximately above fiscal  which had increased  or approximately over the prior year 
the increase was caused by additional sales  operating efficiencies and other factors discussed above 
dividends sysco began paying the quarterly dividend rate of twelve cents per share in february  an increase from the ten cents per share that became effective in february return on shareholders equity the return on average shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for was approximately compared to in and in since inception sysco has averaged in excess of a return on shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
risk factors low margin business  economic sensitivity the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins 
sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup 
as a result  sysco s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of food price deflation  even though sysco s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and economic conditions 
sysco s operating results also are sensitive to  and may be adversely affected by other factors  including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable  inventory control  competitive price pressures  severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
although such factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco s past operations  there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 
leverage and debt service because historically a substantial part of sysco s growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion  sysco s continued growth depends  in large part  on its ability to continue this expansion 
as a result  its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand 
moreover  any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of sysco s common stock 
further  sysco s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 
product liability claims sysco  like any other seller of food  faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness 
with respect to product liability claims  sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance 
however  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  or  if available  may not be adequate to cover liabilities 
sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products  but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers 
if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco s net income and earnings per share 
interruption of supplies sysco obtains all of its foodservice products from other suppliers 
for the most part  sysco does not have long term contracts with any supplier committing it to provide products to sysco 
although sysco s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers  suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities requested 
because sysco does not control the actual production of its products  it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control 
these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers  weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
sysco s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise  could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers  and customers may turn to other distributors 
labor relations as of july   approximately  employees were members of different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations  at operating companies 
in fiscal  agreements covering approximately  employees will expire 
failure to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages 
although sysco has not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date  and believes it has satisfactory relationships with its unions  a work stoppage due to failure to renegotiate a union contract  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on sysco 
integration of acquired companies if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner  its profitability may decrease 
integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise  or with a corporate culture different from sysco s 
if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully  it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base 
in addition  the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management s attention from sysco s existing business and may damage sysco s relationships with its key customers and suppliers 
charter and stockholder rights plan under its restated certificate of incorporation  sysco s board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
issuance of these shares would make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors because more shares would have to be acquired to gain control 
if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco  the stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco  which also means more shares would have to be acquired to gain control 
both of these devices may deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that would have been financially beneficial to sysco s stockholders 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about anticipated industry growth  sysco s long term growth objectives  anticipated capital expenditures  and implementation and timing of fold outs and acquisitions 
these statements are based on current expectations and management estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above 
in addition  decisions to pursue fold outs and acquisitions and expenditures for such could vary depending upon construction schedules and the timing of other purchases  such as fleet and equipment  while the timing and implementation of fold outs and acquisitions could be impacted by competitive conditions  labor issues and other matters 
the ability to pursue acquisitions also depends upon the availability and suitability of potential candidates and management s allocation of capital 
industry growth and sysco s long term growth objectives could be affected by conditions in the economy  the industry and internal factors that may alter planned results
