overview the company s revenues are largely based on the level of assets under management in its businesses as well as the level of fees associated with its various investment products 
growth in revenues generally depends on good investment performance  which increases assets under management by increasing the value of existing assets under management  contributing to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitating the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels 
growth in assets under management is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels  which is usually based on several factors  including performance and service 
historically  the company depended primarily on direct distribution of its products and services  but since has increasingly participated in third party distribution programs  particularly ntf programs 
fluctuations in financial markets also have a substantial effect on assets under management and results of operations  although the company s extensive use of variable compensation programs tends to moderate the effects of fluctuations in revenues 
the company s largest source of revenues is investment advisory fees which are based on the amount of assets under management in its mutual funds and separate accounts businesses 
advisory fees from the mutual funds are computed daily or weekly  while advisory fees from the separate accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter 
these revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions  financial market conditions and the fee structure for assets under management 
revenues derived from the equity oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios 
commission revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of mutual funds  institutional and high net worth clients as well as investment banking revenue  which consists of underwriting profits  selling concessions and management fees associated with underwriting activities

other operating expenses include product distribution and promotion costs  clearing charges and fees for the company s brokerage operation  rental of office space and electronic data equipment and services  insurance  charitable contributions and other general and administrative operating costs

prior to the date of the reorganization  net gain loss from investments was derived primarily from the assets that were distributed to gfi and also included the results of gfi s hedging activities
