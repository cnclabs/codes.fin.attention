readers are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these factors include the effectiveness of management s strategies and decisions  general economic and business conditions  developments in technology  new or modified statutory or regulatory requirements and changing prices and market conditions 
no assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward looking statements 
overview market related factors the company s operating results are sensitive to changes in the prices of alumina  primary aluminum  and fabricated aluminum products  and also depend to a significant degree on the volume and mix of all products sold and on kacc s hedging strategies 
primary aluminum prices have historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of kacc s hedging activities 
changes in global  regional  or country specific economic conditions can have a significant impact on overall demand for aluminum intensive fabricated products in the transportation  distribution  and packaging markets 
such changes in demand can directly affect the company s earnings by impacting the overall volume and mix of such products sold 
to the extent that these end use markets weaken  demand can also diminish for what the company sometimes refers to as the upstream products alumina and primary aluminum 
during  the average midwest united states transaction price amt price per pound of primary aluminum declined to a low of approximately 
per pound in february and then began a steady increase ending at 
per pound 
during  the amt price per pound of primary aluminum experienced a steady decline during the year  beginning the year in the 
to 
range and ending the year in the low 
range 
during  the amt price remained in the 
to 
price range for the first eleven months before declining to the low 
range in december 
subsequent to december   the amt price continued to rise 
at january   the amt price was approximately

kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies incident at gramercy facility on july   kacc s gramercy  louisiana alumina refinery was extensively damaged by an explosion in the digestion area of the plant 
twenty four employees were injured in the incident  several of them severely 
as a result of the incident  alumina production at the facility was completely curtailed 
production at the plant is currently expected to remain completely curtailed until the third quarter of when kacc expects to begin partial production 
based on current estimates  full production is expected to be achieved during the first quarter of or shortly thereafter 
kacc has received the regulatory permit required to operate the plant once the facility is ready to resume production 
the cause of the incident is under investigation by kacc and governmental agencies 
in january  the us mine safety and health administration msha issued citations in connection with its investigation of the incident 
the citations allege  among other things  that certain aspects of the plant s operations were unsafe and that such mode of operation contributed to the explosion 
to date  no monetary penalty has been proposed by msha 
although the company expects that a fine will be levied  the company cannot predict the amount of any such fine s 
it is possible that other civil or criminal fines or penalties could be levied against kacc 
kacc has previously announced that it disagrees with the substance of the citations and has challenged them 
however  as more fully explained below  based on what is known to date and discussions with the company s advisors  the company believes that the financial impact of this incident in excess of insurance deductibles and self retention provisions will be largely offset by insurance coverage 
deductibles and self retention provisions under the insurance coverage for the incident total million  which amounts were charged to cost of products sold in kacc s insurance policies provide that kacc will be reimbursed for the costs of repairing or rebuilding the damaged portion of the facility using new materials of like kind and quality with no deduction for depreciation 
based on discussions with the insurance carriers and their representatives and third party engineering reports  kacc recorded a pretax gain of million  representing the difference between the minimum expected property damage reimbursement amount and the net carrying value of the damaged property of million 
the receivable attributable to the minimum expected property damage reimbursement has been classified as a long term item in other assets  despite the fact that substantially all such amounts are expected to be spent during  as such proceeds will be invested in property  plant and equipment 
the overall impact of recognizing the gain will be a significant increase in stockholders equity and an increase in deprecation expense in future years once production is restored 
the gramercy facility has incurred incremental costs for clean up and other activities during and will continue to incur such costs in these clean up and site preparation activities have been offset by accruals of approximately million for estimated insurance recoveries 
kacc s insurance policies provide for the reimbursement of specified continuing expenses incurred during the interruption period plus lost profits or less expected losses plus other expenses incurred as a result of the incident 
kacc had recorded expected business interruption insurance recoveries totaling million and million in the quarter and year ended december   as a reduction of cost of products sold  which amounts substantially offset actual expenses incurred during these periods 
however  the business interruption insurance amounts recorded represent estimates of kacc s business interruption coverage  based on preliminary discussions with the insurance carriers and their representatives  and are  therefore  subject to change 
kacc currently believes that additional amounts may be recoverable 
any adjustments to the recorded amounts of expected recovery will be reflected from time to time as such amounts are agreed to by the insurance carriers 
the amounts of such adjustments could be material 
since production has been curtailed at the gramercy facility  kacc has  for the time being  suspended depreciation of the facility 
depreciation expense for the first six months of was approximately million 
however  kacc believes that the depreciation expense that would have been incurred may  at least in part  be recoverable under its business interruption insurance coverage 
the incident has also resulted in thirty six class action lawsuits being filed against kacc alleging  among other things  property damage and personal injury 
in addition  a claim for alleged business interruption losses has been made by a neighboring business 
the aggregate amount of damages sought in the lawsuits and other claims cannot be determined at this time  however  kacc does not currently believe the damages will exceed the amount of coverage under its liability policies 
claims relating to all of the injured employees are expected to be covered under kacc s workers compensation or liability policies 
however  the aggregate amount of workers compensation claims cannot be determined at this time and it is possible that such claims could exceed kacc s coverage limitations 
while it is presently impossible to determine the aggregate amount kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies of claims that may be incurred  or whether they will exceed kacc s coverage limitations  kacc currently believes that any amount in excess of the coverage limitations will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  it is possible that as additional facts become available  additional charges may be required and such charges could be material to the period in which they are recorded 
labor matters substantially all of kacc s hourly workforce at the gramercy  louisiana  alumina refinery  mead and tacoma  washington  aluminum smelters  trentwood  washington  rolling mill  and newark  ohio  extrusion facility were covered by a master labor agreement with the united steelworkers of america the uswa which expired on september  the parties did not reach an agreement prior to the expiration of the master agreement and the uswa chose to strike 
in january  kacc declined an offer by the uswa to have the striking workers return to work at the five plants without a new agreement 
kacc imposed a lock out to support its bargaining position and continues to operate the plants with salaried employees and other workers as it has since the strike began 
as a result of the uswa strike  the company temporarily curtailed three out of a total of eleven potlines at its mead and tacoma  washington  aluminum smelters at september  representing approximately  tons per year of production capacity out of a total combined production capacity of  tons per year at the facilities 
restarts of the two mead potlines were completed during mid while a portion of the curtailed potline at tacoma has been restarted to meet internal requirements  the timing for a complete restart of the potline representing approximately  tons of idle production capacity has yet to be determined and will depend upon market conditions and other factors 
while the company initially experienced an adverse strike related impact on its profitability in the fourth quarter of  the company currently believes that kacc s operations at the affected facilities have been substantially stabilized and will be able to run at  or near  full capacity  and that the incremental costs associated with operating the affected plants during the dispute were virtually eliminated as of january excluding the impacts of the restart costs discussed above and the effect of market factors such as the continued market related curtailment at the tacoma smelter 
however  no assurances can be given that kacc s efforts to run the plants on a sustained basis  without a significant business interruption or material adverse impact on the company s operating results  will be successful 
kacc and the uswa continue to communicate 
the objective of kacc has been  and continues to be  to negotiate a fair labor contract that is consistent with its business strategy and the commercial realities of the marketplace 
strategic initiatives kacc s strategy is to improve its financial results by increasing the competitiveness of its existing plants  continuing its cost reduction initiatives  adding assets to businesses it expects to grow  pursuing divestitures of its non core businesses  and strengthening its financial position 
in addition to working to improve the performance of the company s existing assets  the company has devoted significant efforts analyzing its existing asset portfolio with the intent of focusing its efforts and capital in sectors of the industry that are considered most attractive  and in which the company believes it is well positioned to capture value 
the initial steps of this process resulted in the june acquisition of the bellwood extrusion facility  the may formation of akw lp akw  the rationalization of certain of the company s engineered products operations and the company s investment to expand its production capacity for heat treat flat rolled products at its trentwood  washington  rolling mill 
this process has continued in in february  kacc completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in kaiser laroche hydrate partners klhp  an alumina marketing venture  from its joint venture partner for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
additionally  in april  kacc completed the sale of its interest in akw  to its partner for million 
the strategic analysis process also resulted in the company s decision in the latter part of to seek a strategic partner for the further development and deployment of kacc s micromill tm technology and to kacc s later agreement in january to sell the micromill assets and technology  for a nominal payment at closing and future payments based on subsequent performance and profitability of the micromill technology 
another area of emphasis has been a continuing focus on managing the company s legacy liabilities 
the company believes that kacc has insurance coverage available to recover certain incurred and future environmental costs and a substantial portion of its asbestos related costs and is actively pursing claims in this regard 
during  kacc received recoveries totaling kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies approximately million from certain of its insurers related to current and future environmental claims 
the timing and amount of future recoveries of asbestos related claims from insurance carriers remain a major priority of the company  but will depend on the pace of claims review and processing by such carriers and the resolution of any disputes regarding coverage under the insurance policies 
however  during  kacc reached preliminary agreements under which it expects to collect a substantial portion of its expected asbestos related payments from certain insurance carriers in additional portfolio analysis and initiatives are continuing 
valco operating level in  the power allocation for kacc s owned volta aluminium company limited valco smelter in ghana was sufficient for the smelter to operate three out of a total of five potlines as of january each of valco s potlines is capable of producing approximately  tons per year of primary aluminum 
however  production was well below this level in the first half of the year due to the timing of restarts for the two incremental potlines 
consequently  to compensate for the low production in the first half of the year  valco operated above an equivalent three potline annual rate during the last six months of at december   valco was operating four potlines 
valco operated only one potline during most of however  valco earned compensation in in the form of energy credits to be utilized over the last half of and during from the volta river authority vra in lieu of the power necessary to run two of the potlines that were curtailed during the compensation substantially mitigated the financial impact in of the curtailment of such lines 
however  valco did not receive any compensation from the vra for one additional potline which was curtailed in january under a december agreement between valco and the vra  valco s power allocation for and will be sufficient for the smelter to operate four of its five potlines 
valco and the vra also reached an agreement in december that provides a framework for resolving longer term issues 
this framework  among other things  is anticipated to result in an improvement in the reliability of valco s long term power supply and an increase in the price for power beginning in the increase in the price for power will be partially offset by net payments of approximately million valco will receive from the vra over the period to with respect to the provision of power in and flat rolled products in december  the company announced that its flat rolled products business unit expects to accelerate its product mix shift toward higher value added product lines such as heat treat  beverage can lid and tab stock  automotive and other niche businesses  and away from beverage can body stock 
the initial steps of this process should be completed by early  at which point the company will assess related issues such as employment levels at the trentwood facility 
although the shift in product mix is expected to have a favorable impact on the company s results and financial position over the long term  it is possible that such a product mix shift may result in certain non recurring charges that would have an adverse impact on the company s near term results 
results of operations as compared to summary the company reported a net loss of million  or 
of basic loss per common share  for compared to net income of 
million  or 
of basic income per common share  for net sales in totaled  million compared to  million in net loss for included a non cash pre tax charge of million  or

the charges were offset by a pre tax gain on involuntary conversion at gramercy facility of million  or 
per share  a pre tax gain of million  or 
per common share  on the sale of the company s interests in akw and a non cash tax benefit of million  or

per common share  to reduce the carrying value of kacc s micromill assets  more fully discussed above and a non cash tax benefit of million  
per common share  resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters 
kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies bauxite and alumina third party net sales were down in as compared to as a result of a decline in third party average realized prices and a decrease in third party alumina shipments 
the decline in the average realized prices in as compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in net gains from kacc hedging activities 
the decrease in year over year shipments was primarily the net effect of the gramercy incident after considering the  tons of alumina purchased by kacc from third parties to fulfill third party sales contract 
intersegment net sales for declined as compared to the decline was primarily due to a decline in the intersegment average realized price  offset in part by a increase in intersegment shipments  resulting from potline restarts at valco and at the company s washington smelters 
intersegment net sales include approximately  tons of alumina purchased from third parties and transferred to the primary aluminum business unit 
segment operating income was down in as compared to primarily as a result of the price and volume factors discussed above 
segment operating income for was also adversely affected by the million cost of insurance deductibles and self retention provisions related to the gramercy incident and was favorably impacted by the fact that depreciation on the gramercy facility was suspended in july segment operating income for included the adverse impact of approximately million of incremental strike related costs 
primary aluminum third party net sales of primary aluminum were up as compared to as a result of a increase in third party shipments offset by a decrease in the average realized third party sales prices 
the increase in shipments was primarily due to the favorable impact of valco operating three potlines in as compared to one potline in while average primary aluminum market prices for were approximately the same as  the company experienced a reduction in third party average realized prices as a result of a decrease in net gains from kacc hedging activities 
intersegment net sales for were up as compared to intersegment shipments increased due to the timing of shipments to the company s fabricated business units while intersegment average realized prices were down segment operating income for was down compared to the most significant component of this decline was the reduction in the average realized prices discussed above 
results for were also adversely impacted by costs of approximately million and million for the fourth quarter and the year  respectively  associated with preparing and restarting potlines at valco and the washington smelters 
the favorable impact of valco operating at a higher rate in as compared to was substantially offset by the fact that valco earned mitigating compensation of approximately million in for two of its curtailed potlines 
segment operating income for included the adverse impact of approximately million of incremental strike related costs and the favorable impact of the previously mentioned compensation earned by valco as a result of the curtailment of two of its potlines 
flat rolled products net sales of flat rolled products for declined by compared to as a result of a decline in average realized prices and an decline in product shipments 
the decline in average realized prices resulted primarily from a shift in product mix from aerospace products  which have a higher price and operating margin  to other products and a reduction in prices resulting from reduced demand for heat treat products 
the reduction in shipments was primarily due to reduced demand in for aerospace heat treat products offset  in small part  by increased shipments of general engineered products 
the decline in prices and shipments as compared to was responsible for the decline in segment operating income for segment operating income for included the adverse impact of approximately million of incremental strike related costs 
engineered products net sales of engineered products for decreased compared to primarily due to an decline in average realized prices 
product shipments were essentially flat 
the decline in the average sales realized prices in was attributable to a change in product mix higher ground transportation products offset by lower aerospace shipments 
while there was a strong increase in in the demand for ground transportation products it was offset by a reduced demand for aerospace products 
segment operating income for decreased compared to as a result of the factors discussed above as well as the reduced equity in earnings from akw which partnership interests were sold in april 
segment operating income for included the adverse impact of approximately million of incremental strike related costs 
kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies eliminations eliminations of intersegment profits vary from period to period depending on fluctuations in market prices as well as the amount and timing of the affected segments production and sales 
corporate and other corporate operating expenses represent corporate general and administrative expenses which are not allocated to the company s business segments 
corporate operating expenses for were lower than primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expense resulting from the decline in operating results 
as compared to summary the company reported net income of 
million  or 
basic income per common share  for compared to net income of million  or 
of basic income per common share  for net sales in totaled  million compared to  million in net income for included the effect of certain non recurring items  including approximately million  
per common share  of pre tax incremental expense and the earnings impact of lost volume associated with a strike by members of the uswa more fully discussed above  a pre tax non cash charge of million  
per common share  to reduce the carrying value of the company s micromill assets and a non cash tax benefit of million  
per common share  resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters 
net income for included the effect of two essentially offsetting non recurring items a million pre tax restructuring charge and a non cash tax benefit of approximately million related to the settlement of certain tax matters 
bauxite and alumina third party net sales of alumina were up in as compared to primarily due to a increase in third party shipments 
the increase in third party shipments and offsetting decrease in intersegment shipments resulted from reduced shipments to valco  due to the production curtailment more fully discussed above and to a lesser extent  the fourth quarter strike related curtailment of three potlines at the company s washington smelters 
the average realized price for third party alumina sales was down only slightly as the allocated net gains from the company s hedging activities substantially offset the decline in market prices related to the company s primary aluminum linked customer sales contracts 
in addition to being impacted by the reduced shipments to valco and the washington smelters as discussed above  intersegment sales were adversely affected by a substantial market related decline in intersegment average sales prices 
segment operating income was essentially unchanged  excluding the impact of the approximate million of incremental strike related costs 
the adverse impact of reduced intersegment realized prices was essentially offset by improved operating performance resulting from higher production as well as lower energy costs 
primary aluminum third party net sales of primary aluminum were down as compared to primarily as a result of a reduction in shipments  caused by the potline curtailments at valco and the washington smelters 
a reduction in average realized third party sales prices between and reflecting lower market prices offset  in part  by allocated net gains from kacc s hedging activities  also adversely impacted third party net sales 
intersegment net sales were down approximately between and while intersegment shipments were essentially unchanged from the prior year  average realized prices dropped by reflecting lower market prices for primary aluminum 
segment operating income in was down significantly from the operating income impact of the valco potline curtailments was partially mitigated by the compensation from the vra for two of the three curtailed potlines 
in addition to the impact of the one uncompensated potline curtailment at valco  results were also negatively affected by the impact of the potline curtailments at the company s washington smelters  reduced average realized prices primarily on intersegment sales  and an adverse strike related impact of approximately million 
flat rolled products net sales of flat rolled products decreased by during as compared to as a reduction in product shipments was modestly offset by the price impact of changes in product mix 
the mix of product shipments in reflects a higher demand for heat treat products  primarily in the first half of the year  offset by reduced can sheet shipments and an increased level of tolling  all as compared to segment operating income increased significantly in primarily as a result of the increased demand for heat treat products in the first half of and improved operating efficiencies 
segment results for were particularly strong in light of the unfavorable strike related impact of approximately million 
segment results for included a non cash charge recorded in the second quarter of in connection with restructuring activities 
kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies engineered products net sales of engineered products were relatively flat year to year 
an increase in product shipments was effectively offset by market related reductions in product prices as well as by the price impact of changes in product mix 
the increase in year over year shipments is in part due to the impact of the company s ownership of the bellwood extrusion facility in richmond  virginia  for all of versus only half of this was  in part  offset by a decline in year over year sales  attributable to the akw wheels joint venture formation in may and reduced shipments caused by labor difficulties at two major customers 
segment operating income declined by approximately in as compared to  excluding the pre tax net charge related to restructuring of operations and approximately million of adverse incremental strike related impact in  as a result of the market impact of the previously mentioned labor difficulties at two major customers and due to an overall softening in demand  particularly in the second half of the year 
eliminations eliminations of intersegment profit vary from period to period depending on fluctuations in market prices as well as the amount and timing of the affected segments production and sales 
corporate and other corporate operating expenses represent corporate general and administrative expenses which are not allocated to the company s business segments 
excluding the pre tax charge associated with the company s restructuring of operations  corporate expenses were lower in than in primarily as a result of lower consulting and other costs associated with the company s ongoing profit improvement program and portfolio review initiatives

operating activities in  operating activities used of cash 
this amount compares with and when operating activities provided cash of and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities between and was due primarily to the impact of results  excluding non cash charges  and an increased investment in working capital excluding cash 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities between and was due primarily to a reduced investment in working capital excluding cash  the receipt of million of environmental insurance recoveries and the impact of results excluding non cash charges 
investing activities total consolidated capital expenditures were   and million in   and  respectively of which   and million were funded by the minority partners in certain foreign joint ventures 
except for the purchase in of the remaining interest in klhp for approximately million  capital expenditures were made primarily to improve production efficiency  reduce operating costs and expand capacity at existing facilities 
total consolidated capital expenditures  excluding the expenditures to rebuild the gramercy  louisiana facility which will be partially funded with insurance proceeds see overview incident at gramercy facility above  are currently expected to be between and million per year in each of through of which approximately is expected to be funded by the company s minority partners in certain foreign joint ventures 
see financing activities and liquidity below for a discussion of gramercy related capital spending 
management continues to evaluate numerous projects  all of which would require substantial capital  both in the united states and overseas 
the level of capital expenditures may be adjusted from time to time depending on the company s price outlook for primary aluminum and other products  kacc s ability to assure future cash flows through hedging or other means  the company s financial position and other factors 
financing activities and liquidity as of december   the company s total consolidated indebtedness was million  including million outstanding under kacc s credit agreement  as amended  the credit agreement 
at february   kacc had million of unused availability remaining under the credit agreement after allowing for million of outstanding borrowings and million for outstanding letters of credit 
under the credit agreement  kacc is able to borrow by means of revolving credit advances and letters of credit up to million an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of million or a borrowing base relating to eligible accounts receivable kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies and eligible inventory 
the credit agreement  which matures in august  is guaranteed by the company and by certain significant subsidiaries of kacc 
the credit agreement requires kacc to comply with certain financial covenants  places significant restrictions on the company and kacc  and is secured by a substantial majority of the company s and kacc s assets 
the credit agreement does not permit the company  and significantly restricts kacc s ability  to pay any dividends on their common stock 
the indentures governing kacc s public debt includes various restrictions on kacc and its subsidiaries and repurchase obligations upon a change of control as defined 
kacc s and the company s near term liquidity will be  as more fully discussed below  affected by three significant items the gramercy incident  aluminum hedging margin requirements and the amount of net payments for asbestos liabilities 
as of december   the company had recorded estimated recoveries for clean up  site preparation and business interruption costs incurred relating to the gramercy incident of approximately million 
as of december   approximately million of insurance recoveries had been received 
additionally  through february   kacc had received approximately million of additional insurance recoveries 
during  capital spending related to rebuilding the gramercy facility is expected to be approximately million 
kacc believes that between and of such expenditures will ultimately be funded by proceeds from kacc s insurance contracts 
the remainder of the gramercy related capital expenditures will be funded by kacc using existing cash resources  funds from operations and or borrowings under kacc s credit agreement 
the amount of capital expenditures to be funded by kacc will depend on  among other things  the ultimate cost and timing of the rebuild and negotiations with the insurance carriers 
in addition  kacc will incur continuing expenses and experience lost profits subsequent to as a result of the gramercy incident which amounts based on current primary aluminum prices and available facts and circumstances are expected to total another million  which amount is expected to be largely offset by insurance recoveries 
kacc continues to work with the insurance carriers to maximize the amount of recoveries and to minimize  to the extent possible  the period of time between when kacc expends funds and when it is reimbursed 
kacc will likely have to fund an average of days of property damage and business interruption activity  unless some other arrangement is agreed with the insurance carriers  and such amounts will be significant 
the company believes it has sufficient financial resources to fund the construction and business interruption costs on an interim basis 
however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
if insurance recoveries were to be delayed or if there were other significant uses of kacc s existing credit agreement capacity  delays in the rebuilding of the gramercy refinery could occur and could have a material adverse impact on the company s and kacc s liquidity and operating results 
hedging activities could also have an adverse impact on kacc s near term liquidity 
at december   kacc had made margin advances of million and had posted letters of credit totaling million in lieu of making margin advances 
increases in primary aluminum prices subsequent to december   could result in kacc having to make additional margin advances or post additional letters of credit and such amounts could be significant 
kacc s exposure to margin advances is expected to improve throughout as its year positions  which have a lower average maximum contract price than kacc s positions  expire 
kacc is considering various financing and hedging strategies to limit its exposure to further margin advances in the event of aluminum price increases 
however  no assurance can be given that kacc will be successful in this regard 
kacc s estimated annual cash payments  prior to insurance recoveries  for asbestos related costs will be approximately million to million for each of the years through the company believes that kacc will recover a substantial portion of these payments from insurance 
preliminary agreements have been reached with certain insurance carriers under which it expects to collect a substantial portion of its asbestos related payments 
however  delays in receiving these or future insurance repayments would have an adverse impact on kacc s liquidity 
while no assurance can be given that existing cash sources will be sufficient to meet the company s short term liquidity requirements  management believes that the company s existing cash resources  together with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement  will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next year 
kacc s ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt on a long term basis depends on its ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond kacc s control 
kacc will need to refinance all or a substantial portion of its debt on or before its maturity 
no assurance can be given that kacc will be able to refinance its debt on acceptable terms 
however  with respect to long term kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies liquidity  management believes that operating cash flow  together with the ability to obtain both short and long term financing  should provide sufficient funds to meet kacc s and the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements

commitments and contingencies the company and kacc are subject to a number of environmental laws  to fines or penalties assessed for alleged breaches of the environmental laws  and to claims and litigation based upon such laws 
kacc currently is subject to a number of claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments act of cercla and  along with certain other entities  has been named as a potentially responsible party for remedial costs at certain third party sites listed on the national priorities list under cercla 
based on the company s evaluation of these and other environmental matters  the company has established environmental accruals of million at december  however  the company believes that it is reasonably possible that changes in various factors could cause costs associated with these environmental matters to exceed current accruals by amounts that could range  in the aggregate  up to an estimated million 
kacc is also a defendant in a number of lawsuits  some of which involve claims of multiple persons  in which the plaintiffs allege that certain of their injuries were caused by  among other things  exposure to asbestos during  and as a result of  their employment or association with kacc or exposure to products containing asbestos produced or sold by kacc 
the lawsuits generally relate to products kacc has not sold for at least years 
based on past experience and reasonably anticipated future activity  the company has established a million accrual at december   for estimated asbestos related costs for claims filed and estimated to be filed through  before consideration of insurance recoveries 
however  the company believes that substantial recoveries from insurance carriers are probable 
the company reached this conclusion based on prior insurance related recoveries in respect of asbestos related claims  existing insurance policies and the advice of outside counsel with respect to applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of these policies 
accordingly  the company has recorded an estimated aggregate insurance recovery of million determined on the same basis as the asbestos related cost accrual at december  although the company has settled asbestos related coverage matters with certain of its insurance carriers  other carriers have not yet agreed to settlements 
the timing and amount of future recoveries from these carriers will depend on the pace of claims review and processing by such carriers and on the resolution of any disputes regarding coverage under such policies that may arise 
while uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of these matters and it is presently impossible to determine the actual costs that ultimately may be incurred and insurance recoveries that ultimately may be received  management currently believes that the resolution of these uncertainties and the incurrence of related costs  net of any related insurance recoveries  should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in connection with the uswa strike and subsequent lock out by kacc  certain allegations of unfair labor practices ulps have been filed with the national labor relations board nlrb by the uswa 
kacc responded to all such allegations and believes that they are without merit 
in july  the oakland  california  regional office of the nlrb dismissed all material charges filed against kacc 
in september  the union filed an appeal of this ruling with the nlrb general counsel s office kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies in washington  dc if the original decision were to be reversed  the matter would be referred to an administrative law judge for a hearing whose outcome would be subject to an additional appeal either by the uswa or kacc 
this process could take months or years 
there can be no certainty that the original nlrb decision will be upheld 
if these proceedings eventually resulted in a definitive ruling against kacc  it could be obligated to provide back pay to uswa members at the five plants and such amount could be significant 
however  while uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of such matters  the company believes that the resolution of the alleged ulps should not result in a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this section contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
the company s operating results are sensitive to changes in the prices of alumina  primary aluminum  and fabricated aluminum products  and also depend to a significant degree upon the volume and mix of all products sold 
as discussed more fully in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  kacc utilizes hedging transactions to lock in a specified price or range of prices for certain products which it sells or consumes and to mitigate kacc s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following sets forth the impact on future earnings of adverse market changes related to kacc s hedging positions with respect to commodity and foreign exchange contracts described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impact of market changes on energy derivative activities is generally not significant 
alumina and primary aluminum alumina and primary aluminum production in excess of internal requirements is sold in domestic and international markets  exposing the company to commodity price opportunities and risks 
kacc s hedging transactions are intended to provide price risk management in respect of the net exposure of earnings resulting from i anticipated sales of alumina  primary aluminum and fabricated aluminum products  less ii expected purchases of certain items  such as aluminum scrap  rolling ingot  and bauxite  whose prices fluctuate with the price of primary aluminum 
on average  before consideration of hedging activities  any fixed price contracts with fabricated aluminum products customers  variations in production and shipment levels  and timing issues related to price changes the company estimates that each 
increase decrease in the market price per price equivalent pound of primary aluminum increases decreases the company s annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies as of december   approximately and of kacc s net hedgeable volume with respect to and  respectively  is subject to a minimum and maximum contract price 
based on the average december london metal exchange lme cash price for primary aluminum of approximately 
per pound  the company estimates that it would realize a net aggregate pre tax reduction of operating income of approximately million from its hedging positions and fixed price customer contracts during and the company estimates that a hypothetical 
increase from the above stated december price would result in an additional net aggregate pre tax reduction of operating income of approximately million being realized during and related to kacc s hedging positions and fixed price customer contracts 
approximately of the total reductions in operating income would occur in the first half of both amounts are versus what the company s results would have been without the derivative commodity contracts and fixed price customer contracts discussed above 
conversely  the company estimates that a hypothetical 
decrease from the above stated december price level would result in an aggregate pre tax increase in operating income of approximately million being realized during and related to kacc s hedging positions and fixed price customer contracts 
it should be noted  however  that  since the hedging positions and fixed price customer contracts lock in a specified price or range of prices  any increase or decrease in earnings attributable to kacc s hedging positions or fixed price customer contracts would be significantly offset by a decrease or increase in the value of the hedged transactions 
as stated in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  kacc has certain hedging positions which do not qualify for treatment as a hedge under current accounting guidelines and thus must be marked to market each period 
fluctuations in forward market prices for primary aluminum would likely result in additional earnings volatility as a result of these positions 
the company estimates that a hypothetical 
increase in spot market prices from the december   lme cash price of 
per pound would  if the forward market were in a contango position ie  where future prices exceed spot prices  result in additional aggregate mark to market charges of between million during and conversely  the company estimates that a hypothetical 
decrease in year end spot market prices would result in aggregate mark to market income of between million during and for purposes of this computation  the company assumed that the forward market would be essentially flat ie  future prices would approximate the current forward market price 
the foregoing estimated earnings impact on excludes the possible effect on pre tax income of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which must be adopted by the company as of january  in addition to having an impact on the company s earnings  a hypothetical 
per pound change in primary aluminum prices would also impact the company s cash flows and liquidity through changes in possible margin advance requirements 
at december   kacc had made margin advances of million and had posted letters of credit totaling million in lieu of paying margin advances 
increases in primary aluminum prices subsequent to december   could result in kacc having to make additional margin advances or post additional letters of credit and such amounts could be significant 
if primary aluminum prices increased by 
per pound from the year end price by march  and the forward curve were as described above  it is estimated that kacc could be required to make additional margin advances in the range of to million 
on the other hand  a hypothetical 
decrease in primary aluminum prices by march   using the same forward curve assumptions stated above  would be expected to result in kacc receiving a substantial majority of its previous margin advances 
kacc s exposure to margin advances is expected to improve throughout as its year positions  which have a lower average maximum contract price than kacc s positions  expire 
kacc is considering various financing and hedging strategies to limit its exposure to further margin advances in the event of aluminum price increases 
however  no assurance can be given that kacc will be successful in this regard 
foreign currency kacc enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge material cash commitments for foreign currencies 
kacc s primary foreign exchange exposure is related to kacc s australian dollar a commitments in respect of activities associated with its owned affiliate  queensland alumina limited 
the company estimates that  before consideration of any hedging activities  a us increase decrease in the value of the a results in an approximate million decrease increase in the company s annual pre tax earnings 
at december   the company held derivative foreign currency contracts hedging approximately and of its a currency commitments for and  respectively 
the company estimates that a hypothetical reduction in the a exchange rate would result in the company recognizing a net aggregate pre tax cost of approximately million during kaiser aluminum corporation and subsidiary companies and related to kacc s foreign currency hedging positions 
this cost is versus what the company s results would have been without the company s derivative foreign currency contracts 
it should be noted  however  that  since the hedging positions lock in specified rates  any increase or decrease in earnings attributable to currency hedging instruments would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the value of the hedged commitments
