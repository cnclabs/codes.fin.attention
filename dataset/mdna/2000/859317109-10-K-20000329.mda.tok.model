on june   sterling completed the acquisition of northeast bancorp  inc  the parent company of the first national bank of north east  based in north east  maryland 
northeast bancorp is an million bank holding company for the first national bank of north east  with four branches located in cecil county  maryland 
the first national bank of north east will continue to operate as a separate bank 
under the terms of the agreement  northeast bancorp shareholders received two shares of sterling common stock for each share of northeast bancorp s common stock in a tax free exchange 
the transaction was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the consolidated accounts for northeast bancorp for all periods presented 
on january   sterling entered into an agreement with hanover bancorp  inc  based in hanover  pennsylvania  in which hanover bancorp would merge with sterling 
hanover bancorp is the holding company of bank of hanover and trust company 
it had assets of million at december   and ten full service offices located in york and adams county  pennsylvania 
under the terms of the agreement  hanover bancorp shareholders will receive 
shares of sterling common stock for each share of hanover bancorp s common stock in a tax free stock exchange 
the merger  which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the transaction is expected to be completed in mid bank of hanover will continue to operate as a separate subsidiary after the merger 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on non interest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last few years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is always present given changing trends in the economy 
the rate of inflation in was 
at its meeting held on june   the federal open market committee adopted a directive that called for a slight tightening of conditions in reserve markets consistent with an increase of percentage point in the federal funds rate to an average of 
at its meeting in august  the committee adopted a directive that called for an increase of percentage point in the federal funds rate  to an average of and at its november meeting  the committee adopted a directive that called for increasing the federal funds rate by basis points to 
these rate increases resulted in corresponding increases in the prime lending rate during the same time period 
long term  which is defined as five years  market rates began the year at approximately and ended the year at nearly 
this trend in interest rates has yielded a market expectation that interest rates will continue to increase during the year aside from those matters described above  management does not believe that there are any trends or uncertainties which would have a material impact on future operating results  liquidity or capital resources nor is it aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have such an effect

while conducting its year end closing process in the fourth quarter of  management reviewed its accounting policies to ensure conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  including recent pronouncements by the american institute of certified public accountants and the sec concerning audit differences and materiality 
upon completion of this review  management determined that appropriate consideration had not been given to origination costs for loans and leases  investments in affordable housing projects  director deferred compensation arrangements and income taxes 
management has restated sterling s consolidated financial statements to reflect the impact of the adjustments made due to the interpretations of accounting principles related to these items 
management believes that the overall result of the adjustments has not had a material impact on sterling s financial statements 
the impact of the restatements was a  reduction at january  of retained earnings and  and  reduction in net income from the years ended december  and this resulted in a decrease in earnings per share of 
for each of the years ended december  and from amounts previously reported 
growth in interest earning assets was the primary factor contributing to the increased earnings in and as of december   interest earning assets were approximately million compared to million at december average interest earning assets for increased nearly million to over million  up from the prior year 
in  average interest earning assets increased nearly million  up from the current year increase  as well as the increase in  was primarily due to increases in both loans and investment securities 
average interest bearing liabilities increased approximately million  or  in compared to an increase of approximately million  or in the increase in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during and was a direct result of sterling s ability to attract new customers and relationships from some competitors 
these competitors have been experiencing a decline in customer service due to merger integration issues  which has led to their customers seeking financial services from alternative institutions 
the provision for loan losses decreased to  in from  in the provision for loan losses in was  the decline in the provision for loan losses is a result of improvement in credit quality  particularly within the consumer loan portfolio 
noninterest income increased  in compared to an increase of  in the increase in included  income from the sale of the credit card portfolio 
noninterest expense increased to nearly million in from million contributing to the increase in was the merger related expenses involved with northeast bancorp  inc and increased depreciation on operating lease assets 
net interest income the primary component of sterling financial corporation s net earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
for presentation and analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent bases 
for purposes of calculating yields on tax exempt interest income  the taxable equivalent adjustment equates tax exempt interest rates to taxable interest rates as noted in table adjustments are made using a statutory federal tax rate of for  and tax equivalent net interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
this was an increase from the million or increase realized in as depicted in table  the increase in was primarily the result of increased volumes which generated million of additional net interest income  supplemented by 
million due to changes in interest rates 
the net interest margin was compared to in and in table distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity interest rates and interest differential tax equivalent yields and table analysis of changes in net interest income summarize the components of net interest income and illustrate variances as a result of changes in interest rates versus growth in assets and liabilities 
during  sterling s net interest margin remained fairly stable  as management was able to reprice its interest bearing liabilities in a manner that offset the decline in the yield earned on interest earning assets 
the decline in the yield earned on interest earning assets was primarily the result of the continual decline in the yields earned on the loan portfolio  which declined from in to in this decline can be attributed to competitive pressures within sterling s market territory  in which financial institutions are pricing quality credits in a manner which attracts new customers 
although there can be no assurances  management believes there will be pressure to maintain its net interest margin at its historical levels as interest rates have increased over the last third of  which will increase the cost of funding sources 
we believe it will be difficult to gain similar increases on yields in interest bearing assets due to competitive pressures discussed above 
interest income increased over million or from million in of this increase  million was a result of a million or increase in average interest earning assets 
this increase was offset by a million decrease due to a drop in the average yield from in to in the increase in interest income in over was million

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged against earnings was  in compared to  in and  in the provision reflects the amount deemed appropriate by management to produce an adequate reserve to meet the present risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
management s judgement is based on the evaluation of individual loans and their overall risk characteristics  past loan loss experience  and other relevant factors 
net charge offs amounted to  in   in and  in gross charge offs for were  a decline from the  reported in the decline in the provision for loan losses  gross and net charge offs was a result of improvement in credit quality  particularly in the consumer portfolio 
a strong economy  a tightening of certain underwriting criteria during and and strong collection efforts contributed to the improvement 
loan quality remains high in the commercial loan portfolio as evidenced by the continuing low levels of delinquency  charge offs and non accruals

investment securities gains are also reflected in noninterest income 
income from fiduciary activities  which is investment management and trust services income  reached a record level of over million  an increase of nearly 
million or 
this follows an increase of in over fees increased primarily due to increased transaction volumes and growth in assets under management  which increased from million in  to million in  to million in this growth in assets resulted from new relationships developed  as well as market appreciation on existing assets under management 
management continues to feel that the wealth management division  or trust services  represents a significant growth opportunity for the corporation 
sterling will continue its concerted efforts to expand the business  which includes marketing activities and the hiring of experienced professionals 
although wealth management professionals can continue to generate new business  the value of assets under management is directly related to the stock market 
declines in the stock market could have an adverse impact on income from fiduciary activities 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  or during this follows an increase of  or 
in general increases in service charges on various accounts  as well as transaction volume produced the increase in over management continuously monitors the fee structure and makes changes where appropriate 
other service charges  commissions and fees increased  or in compared to the increase in over was  or 
contributing to the increase in as well as were the fees received on mutual funds transactions and fees on the debit card product offered by subsidiary banks 
income from mortgage banking activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and the fluctuation in mortgage banking income is directly related to the residential mortgage interest rate environment and the mortgage products offered 
in  the relatively low residential mortgage interest rate environment combined with an expansion of products and services offered resulted in an increase in the volume of loans sold on the secondary market  from million in to million in during  residential mortgage interest rates increased resulting in a slow down in mortgage loan originations as evidenced by million in loans sold in the secondary market 
as a result of this volume  gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled   and  for the years ended december   and another component of the decrease in mortgage banking income is mortgage servicing rights capitalized and included as mortgage banking income 
amounts capitalized are directly related to the volume of loans sold in the secondary market 
mortgage servicing rights capitalized for the years ended december   and totaled   and  sterling originated all mortgages sold on the secondary market 
no mortgages were acquired from third parties  nor have servicing rights been purchased from third parties 
the mortgage servicing portfolio totaled million as of december  compared to million on december  during  the bank of lancaster county sold its credit card portfolio for a gain of million 
rental income on operating leases has increased from  in to  in this follows an increase of in over the increase in rental income is primarily due to an increase in the number of units under operating leases which totaled   and  as of december   and sterling recognizes that leasing operations represent a growth opportunity for the corporation and has committed resources to expand this business 
these resources include increased marketing efforts  not only in developing new customer relationships  but also in maintaining existing customer relationships 
with the hiring of additional employees to perform operational functions  salesmen are able to devote more of their time to business development and less time performing operational activities 
additionally  the strong national and local economy has led to our clients expanding their business operations  resulting in an increase in the number of new units leased within our customer base 
other operating income totaled million in  which was consistent with million earned in other operating income declined in compared to the million earned in due primarily to a  gain recognized on the sale of real estate in the corporation was able to sell this real estate  which formerly housed the leasing operations  with the purchase of the  square foot administrative service center in investment securities gains totaled  in  in and  in the securities sold in and were equity securities from the available for sale securities portfolio

noninterest expenses table noninterest expenses increase increase decrease decrease amount amount salaries and employee benefits     net occupancy    furniture equipment    professional services  depreciation on operating lease assets      merger related costs other operating expense    total      operating expense levels are often measured by the efficiency ratio  which expresses noninterest expense as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and total fees and other income 
operating leases significantly impact sterling s consolidated efficiency ratio  which tends to drive the ratio higher than is typically acheived on financial institutions with no similar operating lease portfolio 
in order to effectively monitor the efficiency ratio  sterling monitors this ratio on its two significant operating segments community banking and related services and leasing 
sterling s efficiency ration for each significant segment has shown improvement in compared to the prior two years 
excluding non recurring items  the operating efficiency ratio for community banking and related services moved down to in  versus in and in the leasing segment s ratio was reduced to in  versus in and in the largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits which increased  or to million from million in  after increasing million or during the number of full time equivalent employees at year end and was the salary expense increase was due primarily to normal merit increases and promotions 
also included in the increase for and are the increased costs of benefits such as health insurance and additional benefit plans 
net occupancy expense decreased  or to million in from million in this compares to a decrease of  in from furniture and equipment expense experienced an increase of  or to million in from million in  compared to an increase of  or in included in the increase of furniture and equipment expense in is an increase in depreciation of approximately professional services increased  or in to million after increasing  or in the increase in professional services over the last two years can be attributed to sterling s increased reliance on services outsourced to third parties 
these third parties bring a greater degree of knowledge and experience to the organization than that which can be obtained internally 
merger related costs incurred in totaled  and was a direct result of sterling s acquisition of northeast bancorp  inc completed during the second quarter of these merger expenses consisted entirely of attorney  accountant  investment advisory and application fees 
depreciation on operating leases increased  or in from compared to  increase or from compared to the increase is directly related to the increase in number of units on operating lease to customers discussed above  and the percent increase each year is consistent with the increase in rental income on operating leases 
other expenses increased  or to nearly million during after increasing  or during the increase is consistent with rising costs associated with acquiring services covered in this category of expense 
expenses in this category include advertising and marketing  postage  telephone  stationery and forms  atm fees  insurance premiums  training and education  pennsylvania shares tax and other expense categories not specifically identified on the income statement

asset quality sterling has policies and procedures designed to manage credit risk and to maintain the quality of its loan portfolio 
these include prudent underwriting standards for new loan originations and ongoing monitoring and reporting of asset quality measures and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
sterling s commercial  consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers within lancaster county  pennsylvania  cecil county  maryland  and surrounding counties 
since the majority of sterling s real estate loans are located within this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
the economic conditions within sterling s market area remained healthy in the unemployment rate for lancaster county  pennsylvania and cecil county  maryland  sterling s primary market area  both remained below than 
in fact  lancaster county has now had an unemployment rate of less than for consecutive months 
additionally  reasonably low interest rates  a continuing strong economy and minimal inflation resulted in a record number of sales of existing homes 
a portion of sterling s loan portfolio consists of loans to agricultural related borrowers 
this industry experienced a difficult year in  with low crop yields as a result of a drought and low milk prices in late due to oversupply 
while sterling continues to pursue quality loans to the dairy industry and the agricultural community in general  it should be noted that these loans are susceptible to a variety of external factors such as adverse climate  economic conditions  etc 
in addition to factors common in other industries 
the loan portfolio is well diversified with no industry concentrations comprising greater than of total loans outstanding 
a concentration is defined as amounts loaned to multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
there were no foreign loans outstanding at december  nonperforming assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans  accruing loans past due days or more and other real estate owned 
sterling s general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when management determines that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
when management places a loan on nonaccrual status  it reverses unpaid interest credited to income in the current year  and charges unpaid interest accrued in prior years to the allowance for loan losses 
sterling recognizes income on these loans only to the extent that it receives cash payments 
sterling typically returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time 
sterling categorizes a loan as restructured if it changes the terms of the loan such as interest rate  repayment schedule or both  to terms which it otherwise would not have granted originally

as of december   total non performing assets totaled  a decline of  or  from the december  balance of  the decline in nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due days or more during the year is consistent with the downward trend sterling has experienced since the restructured loans included in nonperforming loans represents a series of loans to one borrower in the real estate business 
sterling has no commitment to lend this customer additional funds related to the restructured notes 
these restructured loans are fully secured with real estate collateral  are current  and have performed in accordance with the contractual terms  both prior to and after the restructuring 
accrual of interest on the restructured loans continues 
sterling s loan delinquency past due greater than days as a percent of loans outstanding declined during at december   this rate stood at 
compared to 
and 
for december  and the average delinquency rate for of 
declined from 
in the decline in the delinquency rate was primarily attributed to improvement in the consumer loan portfolio  and is partially attributed to the sale of the credit card portfolio in the credit card portfolio tended to have higher delinquencies associated with it than the remainder of the consumer loan balances 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans which have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as nonperforming loans in the future 
total potential problem loans approximated million at december  the majority of these loans are secured by real estate with acceptable loan to value ratios 
sterling has implemented sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  an amendment of sfas no 
 at the beginning of a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that sterling will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
generally  this definition includes all loans on nonaccrual status and restructured loans  except those specifically excluded from the scope of sfas no 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  sterling does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures 
the following table presents information concerning impaired loans at december  and impaired loans with a valuation allowance   impaired loans without a valuation allowance total impaired loans   valuation allowance related to impaired loans the decline in impaired loans is primarily attributed to a  reduction in non accrual loans at december  versus december  a large portion of the impaired loans is attributed to the restructure of a series of loans to one borrower as previously discussed 
allowance for loan losses sterling maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio 
it is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
quarterly  the company utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
this methodology  which has remained consistent for the past several years  results in an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
management assigns internal risk ratings to all commercial relationships with aggregate borrowings or commitments to extend credit in excess of  utilizing migration analysis for the previous eight quarters  management develops a loss factor test which it then uses to estimate losses on impaired loans  potential problem loans and non classified loans 
when management finds loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest  it places those loans on the problem list  and evaluates them on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses 
management s analysis considers adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of underlying collateral  and prevailing market conditions 
if management determines that a specific reserve allocation is not required  it assigns the general loss factor to determine the reserve 
for homogeneous loan types  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous two years for each specific loan pool 
additionally  management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors  including the following trends in delinquency levels  trends in non performing and potential problem loans  trends in composition  volume and terms of loans  effects in changes in lending policies or underwriting procedures  experience ability and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  concentrations in lending activities  other factors that management may deem appropriate 
management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on the following criteria risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time 
management feels the above methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual losses to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically updates the methodology discussed above  which reduces the difference between actual losses and estimated losses 
management bases the provision for loan losses  or lack of provision  on the overall analysis taking into account the methodology discussed above 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses is as follows table summary of loan loss experience years ended december  allowance for loan losses beginning balance      loans charged off during year commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer  lease financing total charge offs   recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer lease financing total recoveries net loans charged off   provision for loan losses  balance at end of year      ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding

allowance for loan losses as a percent of average loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans at end of year allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the allowance for loan losses increased slightly from  at december  to  at december  despite this increase  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of outstanding loans continued to decline  and was at december  versus at december  this decrease is reflective of sterling s improving asset quality ratios 
net charge offs over the last three years were   and  for the years ended december   and the decrease in net charge offs was a direct result of a strong economy  the tightening of certain underwriting criteria in and along with strong collection efforts in all loan portfolios 
additionally  the significant improvements in the consumer loan portfolio were partially the result of sterling selling its credit card portfolio in  which consistently had higher delinquencies and charge offs than the remainder of the consumer loan portfolio 
as a result  similar improvements were noted in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans  which increased from in  to in  to in finally  loan delinquencies as percent of loans outstanding declined to 
at december   well below the levels of sterling s peer group

the largest reserve allocation is to the commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio and represents of the reserve 
although the reserve allocation to this portfolio has increased over the last two years  the reserve allocation as a percent of related loans remained at approximately to 
this nonhomogeneous loan portfolio continues to represent the greatest risk exposure to sterling  as the credits generally are significantly larger than the remainder of the portfolio and the related collateral is not as marketable 
additionally  other external factors such as competition for high rated credits has also been considered in allocating this reserve balance 
as mentioned previously  sterling sold its credit card portfolio in  which resulted in a significant improvement in net charge offs within the consumer loan portfolio 
the sale of the credit card portfolio combined with increased collections efforts also resulted in a decline in the consumer loan delinquencies 
as a result  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the consumer loan portfolio has declined since the allocation  and has remained at approximately 
of the related loan balance as of december  and the increase in the reserve allocation related to the lease portfolio from to is a direct result of the growth in this portfolio as well as an increase in problem credits within this portfolio 
however  the reserve allocation as a percent of average loans outstanding remains below the levels  consistent with the decrease in net charge offs and lower delinquency ratios 
over the past several years  the allowance for loan losses to outstanding loans has declined 
similarly  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses has also shown a steady decline  both in the dollar amount and as a percent of the total reserve 
the unallocated portion totaled  at december   or of the allowance for loan losses balance 
these trends are closely related to improvements in asset quality ratios  including the following an increase in the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans from at december  to at december  a decline in the non performing loans to total loans from 
at december  to 
at december  a decline in loan delinquencies as a percent of total loans outstanding from 
at december  to 
at december  a reduction in the ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding from 
for the year ended december  to 
for the year ended december  based upon the improvements noted above  management feels the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding as well as the unallocated portion of the reserve is justified 
management has not targeted any specific coverage ratio of nonperforming loans by the allowance for loan losses  and this ratio may fluctuate based on loans placed into or removed from nonperforming status 
based upon information presently available  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
deposits the subsidiary banks of sterling continue to rely heavily on deposit growth as the primary source of funds for lending activities 
in  total deposits grew nearly million or to million 
noninterest bearing deposits grew million or while interest bearing deposits grew million or

long term debt remained at approximately million 
the primary reason for the significant increases in short term borrowings is due to management s decision to fund its growth in its finance and operating lease portfolios through short term borrowings 
the short term borrowings have floating interest rates primarily indexed to federal funds or the day libor rate 
management turned to short term borrowings as a source of funds in order to effectively manage interest rate risk 
typically  long term borrowings have maturities of years 
during  the year us treasury yield rose at a faster rate than federal funds borrowing rate and libor 
as a result  management elected to fund a portion of its lease operating activities through short term borrowings in order to capitalize on the disparity in rates offered 
at no time during the year  did short term borrowings exceed of stockholders equity 
capital the management of capital provides the foundation for future asset and profitability growth and represents a major funding source to sterling 
as of december   stockholders equity increased  or from december  the increase was the result of net income  less dividends declared of  dividend pay out ratio of  plus proceeds from issuance of treasury shares of  offset by a decrease in unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale  net of tax  totaling  sterling and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on sterling and the subsidiary banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  sterling and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require sterling and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
management believes  as of december  and  that sterling and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and are categorized as well capitalized 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the subsidiary banks category

some liquidity is ensured by assets that are readily convertible to cash such as federal funds sold  noninterest bearing and interest bearing balances with banks 
in addition the investment portfolio and the loan leasing portfolio generate a constant stream of cash flows from maturities and scheduled repayments 
securities maturing within one year amounted to million 
sterling s security portfolio is composed of million in securities available for sale 
scheduled loan repayments within the next year total about million 
additional liquidity is generated by mortgage sales 
in  million in mortgage originations were sold on the secondary market  which provides for an ongoing ability to meet the needs of customers for new mortgage financing 
deposit growth is another source of liquidity 
sterling has a relatively stable core deposit base for funding investment assets 
deposit balance levels are usually predictable and grew by million in sterling maintains short term borrowing capacity with several correspondent banks and has the availability to immediately borrow approximately million from the federal home loan bank 
sterling manages liquidity daily by monitoring the projected cash inflows and outflows 
impact of year during  sterling maintained its commitment to ensure that its daily operations suffered little or no impact from the century date change 
the year project team continued to assess sterling s year readiness  addressing not only computer and technology areas  but all aspects of the corporation s business 
the year action plan had five key project phases awareness  assessment  renovation or remediation  testing or validation and implementation addressing systems for both sterling and its third party processors 
sterling completed all five phases well in advance of december  during the process  sterling inventoried and assessed all software  hardware and systems for year readiness 
any noncompliant hardware or software were upgraded or replaced 
testing ensured that all mission critical systems would function correctly in the year and beyond and would properly handle all date sensitive data 
utilizing information from written vendor surveys  internet sites and internal testing  sterling assessed the year readiness of vendors and service providers to determine the extent to which its systems would need to be modified or replaced or were vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
additionally  through written surveys and loan officer contact  sterling assessed the year readiness of customers holding significant commercial loans 
sterling s subsidiary banks established year compliance as a factor in its credit decisions and loan documentation 
during  sterling finalized its comprehensive year contingency plan which encompassed all mission critical mainframe and pc applications  third party relationships and environmental systems 
this plan also addresses aspects outside the corporation s control  such as telecommunications  electric companies and other utility companies 
despite passing the century date change  sterling s contingency plans continue to be maintained and reassessed for thoroughness on an on going basis in the event of unexpected year problems 
to date  sterling has successfully managed its year transition and has experienced no significant problems 
limited exposure remains with certain specific future dates 
however  those dates have already been tested and verified as part of the overall year assessment 
management will continue monitoring all areas to ensure that business will not be disrupted 
failure of sterling or third parties whom the corporation relies upon to correct year issues which remain could cause disruption of operations resulting in increased operating costs and other adverse effects 
in addition  if customers financial positions were weakened as a result of year issues  credit quality could be affected 
it is not possible to predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that may result from a failure of sterling or third parties to become fully compliant or whether such effects could have a material impact on the corporation 
through december   the cost of the year project totaled  and included approximately  in capitalized costs incurred to replace non compliant hardware and software 
in  project costs totaled  and included approximately  in capitalized costs 
final project costs expected to be incurred in for ongoing monitoring and support activities are not expected to be material 
the total cost of the project was funded through operating cash flows 
one additional cost that resulted from the century date change  was the accumulation of approximately million in excess cash on hand in order to prepare for possible customer demands 
once we passed january   our cash on hand was reduced to normal levels within the first few weeks of the new year 
new financial accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statement no 
 which will become effective for sterling on january  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  an entity may elect to designate a derivative as follows a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of an exposure of an unrecognized firm commitment  available for sale security  a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction or a net investment in a foreign operation 
the impact of this standard will not have a material impact on sterling s financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issues statement no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise  which became effective for sterling on january  this statement requires that after the securitization of mortgage loans  the classification of the resulting mortgage basked securities be based on the ability and intent to sell or hold the securities 
sterling does not presently securitize its mortgage loans sold into mortgage backed securities  and as such  the impact of this standard had no effect on sterling s financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued its exposure draft  business combinations and intangible assets  that would change the accounting for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
in summary  the exposure draft eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  as the fasb believes this method gives investors less relevant information  ignores the values exchanged in a business combination  and artificially boosts future earnings because pooling of interests reflects assets at historical cost 
as a result  the exposure draft would require companies to account for all business combinations using the purchase method 
as a general rule  in accounting for acquisitions under the purchase method  a new accounting basis is established for the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their fair value and recognizes goodwill 
goodwill is the intangible asset that results from the difference between the purchase price and total fair value of assets and liabilities obtained and is required to be amortized over future periods 
in another major change from current practice  the exposure draft requires that the maximum period for goodwill amortization be reduced from years to years 
under the proposed statement  the use of the purchase method of accounting would be required for all business combinations initiated after the date the final statement is issued 
the other accounting provisions eg amortization requirements generally also would be effective on a prospective basis immediately after issuance of the final statement 
adoption of this statement may depress bank stocks by constraining or eliminating the merger premium in bank stock prices 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks which may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
sterling s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is an economic exposure to future net earnings and future value of equity capital that can occur based on changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is inherent  because as a financial institution  sterling derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates  and then reinvesting those funds into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
current pricing can be established to generate a specific spread  or net interest margin  of income to cover operating costs and produce expected profit to its shareholders 
interest rate risk occurs when financial market rates increase or decrease in the future 
if interest rates increase or decrease  there could be a positive or negative effect on future income 
the net interest margin spread could increase or decrease based on the level of risk taken by the corporation 
if earning assets can reprice faster than its funding sources  the risk position will generate more revenue in the future on the same asset base if rates increase and less revenue if rates decrease 
if funding sources reprice faster than earning assets  the opposite effect to income will occur on the same asset base with increasing and decreasing interest rates 
interest rate risk can also occur when fixed rate commitments are made for future dates 
management endeavors to control the exposure of earnings to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the asset liability committee is responsible for these decisions  which operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on levels of risk 
these policies are approved by the board of directors 
the committee measures risk exposure by internal models  which involves assumptions and estimates which inherently cannot measure with complete precision 
core deposit repricing is modeled based on historic pricing correlations to rate movement 
the internal models are supplemented by risk analytics  inc  an external service specializing in risk assessment 
the corporation has a negative cumulative gap at one year in the future in the amount of million of earning assets 
this risk position would result in a decreasing net interest margin in the next year if market rates increase  since this volume of funding liabilities in excess of the volume of earning assets repricing in the next year would have a negative effect on income 
this position will generate more income or widen the net interest margin if rates decrease in the next year 
beyond one year the risk position is recaptured
