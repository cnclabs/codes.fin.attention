sfas requires an entity to measure all derivatives at fair value and to recognize them in the balance sheet as an asset or liability  depending on the entity s rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
the recognition of changes in fair value of a derivative that affect the income statement will depend on the intended use of the derivative 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss on the derivative will be recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for special hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative will either be recognized in income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged or be deferred in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings
