item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview costar is the leading provider of information services to the us commercial real estate industry 
we are creating a digital marketplace where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized information 
our wide array of digital service offerings includes a leasing marketplace  a selling marketplace  comparable sales information  decision support  tenant information  property marketing  and industry news 
substantially all of our current services are digitally delivered over the internet 
we completed our initial public offering in july and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we primarily used those net proceeds to fund the geographic and service expansion of our business  including three strategic acquisitions  and to expand our sales and marketing organization 
in may  we completed a follow on public offering and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used a portion of those net proceeds to fund the acquisition of comps  and we expect to use the remainder of the proceeds primarily for development and distribution of new services  expansion of all existing services across our current markets  geographic expansion in the us and international markets  strategic acquisitions and working capital and general corporate purposes 
from through  we expanded the geographical coverage of our existing services and developed new services 
in addition to internal growth  this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource  inc in chicago in and new market systems  inc in san francisco in in august  we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houston based real estate information provider c data services  inc in january  we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend  and into atlanta and dallas fort worth by acquiring jamison 
in september  we acquired ares  a los angeles based developer and distributor of ares for act 
in february  we acquired comps discussed in detail later in this section 
we consider regions that have had ongoing operations for at least months to be established  and we currently generate positive cash flow from our operations in established regions 
as of december   the following regions are those that have been in operation for more than months and that we consider to be established washington  new york  los angeles  chicago  san francisco  philadelphia and boston 
these regions provide us with substantial cash flow  which we reinvest into the business 
since our inception  the development of our business has required substantial investments for the expansion of services and the establishment of operating regions  which has resulted in substantial net losses on an overall basis 
the incremental cost of introducing new services in an established region in the future may reduce the profitability of a region or cause it to incur losses 
we expect continued development and distribution of new services  expansion of all existing services across current markets and geographic expansion in the us and international markets 
therefore  while we expect operations in existing established regions to remain profitable and provide substantial funding  we expect our overall expansion plans to generate significant losses and negative cash flow from operations during the next two years 
although our services are expanding rapidly  our costar property and costar tenant services currently generate the largest portion of our revenue 
the costar property and costar tenant contracts range from terms of one to three years and generally renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the contract rates increase automatically in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we charge fixed amounts rather than fees based on actual system usage 
we charge our clients based on the number of sites  organization size  the company s business focus  and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our contract renewal rate currently exceeds on an annual basis 
our clients pay contract fees on an annual  quarterly  or monthly basis 
we recognize this revenue over the life of the contract on a straight line basis beginning with the installation or renewal date 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by the growth in our accounts receivable 
as explained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear later in this report  the financial data for through is derived from the audited financial statements of us and of our predecessor companies for those years 
consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues    cost of revenues    gross margin    operating expenses selling and marketing    software development  general and administrative    total operating expenses    loss from operations    other income expense  net  net loss    comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues

revenues from regions we considered established as of december  grew from million in to million in  an increase of 
during  we expanded into seattle and acquired and converted over twenty regions  including atlanta  dallas  denver  florida and the midwest 
our advertising revenues  which we generated primarily in our established regions  increased from  in to million in gross margin 
gross margin increased from million in to million in while gross margin increased in total  as a percentage of revenues it decreased from to 
the increase in gross margin amounts resulted principally from significant revenue growth from established regions 
the decline in gross margin percentages resulted from expansion of services in established regions  an increase in the number of emerging regions and lower gross margins in the newly acquired regions 
furthermore  our cost of revenues for the year ended december  includes purchase price amortization from the leasetrend  jamison and ares acquisitions of approximately  selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in selling and marketing expenses increased as a result of the cost of the acquired sales organizations and purchase price amortization of an aggregate amount of approximately million for the jamison  leasetrend and ares acquisitions for the year ended december  in addition  continued expansion of the sales organization and marketing efforts required for growth  particularly in emerging and acquired regions  including phoenix  houston  denver  florida and the midwest  contributed to the increased expenses 
software development expenses 
software development expenses increased from  in to million in  but decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase in expenses reflects development costs for the expansion of services for emerging and established regions and new service initiatives 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in general and administrative expenses increased due to the hiring of new employees to support the expanding scope of our operations and client base  as well as the increased administrative costs of a public company 
additionally  our general and administrative expenses include an aggregate amount of approximately million of purchase price amortization from the leasetrend  jamison and ares acquisitions 
other income 
other income increased from  in to million in this increase resulted from an increase in interest income due to our higher average cash balances in  reflecting the net proceeds from our follow on public offering in may comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues 
revenues grew from million in to million in this increase resulted principally from growth in our client base in all regions we served  expansion into new regions  and expansion of our services in existing regions

our advertising revenues  which we generated primarily in our established regions  increased from  in to  in gross margin 
gross margin increased from million in to million in this increase represented an improvement from to of revenues 
the increase resulted principally in established regions  where revenue growth exceeded the growth of cost of revenues  which remained relatively constant 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  but decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in selling and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our sales organization into new regions and began to enhance our selling and marketing capabilities on a national basis 
selling expenses declined as a percent of revenues due to sales growth during the year and the growing renewable contract base 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  but decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in general and administrative expenses increased because we hired new employees to support our expanding organization and client base  and also in response to increases in our occupancy and communication costs

acquisition on january   the company acquired all of the common stock of leasetrend  inc  a cincinnati based provider of commercial real estate information  for approximately million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the consideration was valued for accounting purposes at approximately million including acquisition expenses 
jamison research  inc 
acquisition on january   the company acquired all of the common stock of jamison research  inc  an atlanta based provider of commercial real estate information  for approximately million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the consideration was valued for accounting purposes at approximately million including acquisition expenses 
ares development group  llc acquisition on september   the company acquired all of the membership interests of ares development group  llc  los angeles based developers and distributors of ares for act  for  in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the consideration was valued for accounting purposes at approximately  including acquisition expenses 
in addition  the acquisition agreement provides for  of additional consideration in a combination of cash and stock that may be paid by the company upon the achievement of certain operating goals by the members of ares 
in february  we issued  shares of our common stock and paid  in cash to the members of ares for the achievement of the first of the operating goals by the members of ares 
comps 
com  inc 
acquisition on february   costar completed the acquisition of comps under a merger agreement  dated as of november   among costar  comps and acq sub  inc acq sub  a wholly owned subsidiary of costar 
comps primary asset is a database of commercial real estate sales information 
in connection with the transaction  comps was merged with and into acq sub  which was the surviving corporation in the merger 
immediately after the merger  acq sub changed its name to comps  inc the merger agreement provided for each share of comps common stock to receive either in cash or shares of costar common stock  subject to adjustment to ensure that of the comps shares received costar common stock and of the comps shares received cash 
the aggregate consideration included  in cash paid to former holders of comps common stock excluding cash paid for fractional shares  and  shares of costar common stock including shares issued to former warrantholders of comps 
comps reported a cash and short term investment balance of approximately million at september   which resulted from its initial public offering in may comps also reported long term debt of approximately million at september  although comps was experiencing operating losses and negative cash flow from operations  the remaining cash and short term investments at the closing date significantly offset the overall cash consideration for the purchase of comps by the company 
the cash portion of the purchase price was obtained by costar from the proceeds from the sale of its common stock in a public offering in may we will make significant investments to integrate comps into our organization  including costs to upgrade computer systems  establish network connections  convert database structures  train personnel  and migrate comps clients to our services 
we are taking steps to reduce the operating losses and negative cash flow of our comps subsidiary  but we expect these losses and negative cash flow to continue throughout the year additionally  costar will experience significant charges to operations for the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition 
these assets will be amortized over lives of two to ten years 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was  at december   an increase of  from  at december  this increase was due principally to the million in proceeds from the follow on public offering  which was offset by cash used for the acquisitions of leasetrend and jamison in january and ares in september  cash used in operating activities   in purchases of property and equipment and  in purchased building photography 
during the year ended december   we financed our operations and growth through cash flow from the established regions and the proceeds of the public offerings 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  this was a direct result of expenditures required for the expansion in the emerging and acquired regions 
we continue to experience overall operating losses as a result of our recent expansion into emerging and acquired regions  while established regions continue to generate substantial cash flow from operations 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to  for the year ended december   including  net of acquired cash for the acquisition of leasetrend  jamison and ares 
additional investing activities included capitalized product development costs  purchased building photography  and purchase of property and equipment  consisting principally of computer and office equipment 
as a result of our expansion  we have entered into numerous operating leases for office space throughout the country  including costar s and comps headquarters  and have commitments for rent payments ranging from  to  annually over the next ten years 
other than such leases and related commitments for leasehold improvements  we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies  and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we expect to use cash  stock  or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
we expect to incur significantly higher costs  particularly as we introduce new and upgraded services  expand geographically  and develop the infrastructure to support the expanding organization and client base 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow from our established regions should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next two years 
through september   we operated as either a subchapter s corporation or a limited partnership  and we were not subject to corporate income taxes 
after september   we became a taxable entity 
although we have experienced losses to date  future profits  to the extent not offset by the benefits of loss carryforwards  would result in income tax liabilities 
we do not expect to benefit substantially from tax loss carryforwards generated prior to july further  the reversal of deferred taxes of approximately million at december   recorded in connection with the purchase of acquired intangibles  will result in a non cash income tax benefit in future periods 
we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations 
year we are not aware of any year issues that have affected our business 
the amounts that we expended in connection with year compliance were not significant  as we undertook most of our activities in the normal course of business 
we estimate  however  that we spent approximately million in in connection with year compliance 
it is possible that the company s computerized systems could be affected in the future by the year issue 
the company has numerous computerized interfaces with third parties that are possibly vulnerable to failure if those third parties have not adequately addressed their year issues 
system failures resulting from these issues could cause disruption to the company s operations 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements we have made forward looking statements in this report that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include information that is not purely historic fact  including statements concerning the financial outlook for and estimates for the future  our possible or assumed future results of operations generally  new products and services that we expect to release  and other statements and information more specifically regarding assumptions about our earnings per share  capital and other expenditures  financing plans  cash flow  capital structure  pending legal proceedings and claims  future economic performance  operating income  management s plans  goals and objectives for future operations and growth and markets for stock 
the sections of this report  which contain forward looking statements  include business  properties  legal proceedings and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our forward looking statements are also identified by words such as believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates or similar expressions 
you should understand that these forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting our judgment  not guarantees of future performance 
they are subject to a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed in risk factors  could affect the our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements competition and technological innovation by competitors  sensitivity to general economic conditions and events that affect commercial real estate in particular  business combinations and strategic alliances by other industry participants  growth in commerce conducted over the internet  changes in relationships with real estate brokers and other strategic partners  and legal and regulatory issues 
accordingly  you should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section 
we do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
risk factors our future profitability is uncertain due to our continuing operating losses 
we have never recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new services has exceeded the profits generated in our established markets 
we intend to continue to invest in expansion and new services and will therefore sustain substantial losses for at least the next two years 
our ability to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to generate profits from services that exceed our investment in geographic expansion and new services 
we may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to earn a profit  to maintain profits on a quarterly or annual basis  or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons  such as our investments in geographic expansion  the timing of new service introductions and enhancements  the success of new products  the timing of investing the net proceeds from our offerings  acquisitions of other companies or assets  sales and marketing promotional activities  loss of clients or revenues due to consolidation in the real estate industry  changes in client budgets  or our investments in other corporate resources 
we may not achieve the cost savings and sales enhancements that we expect to result from the integration of costar and comps 
the merger between costar and comps may not be successful unless we realize significant cost savings and increased sales 
our success in realizing these cost savings and increased sales  and the timing of this realization  depend on the quality and speed of the integration of costar and comps 
we have established an integration team that has identified specific areas for cost savings and is continuing to plan the coordination of the two companies 
however  we may not realize the cost savings and sales enhancements that we anticipate from integrating operations following completion of the merger as fully or as quickly as we expect for a number of reasons  including errors in planning or integration  delays in implementing the integration plan  and unexpected events such as major changes in the markets in which we operate 
we may not be able to successfully introduce new products  including our costar exchange product 
our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new products into the marketplace 
developing new products  such as costar exchange  imposes heavy burdens on our systems development department  product managers  management and researchers 
in addition  successfully launching and selling a new product  such as costar exchange  puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources 
if we are unable to develop new products  such as costar exchange  then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we incur significant costs in developing new products  such as costar exchange  or are not successful in marketing and selling these new products  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to complete successfully our planned expansion 
our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our services and the areas where we do business 
these expansion efforts must occur while information technology is rapidly changing 
these efforts impose additional burdens on our research  systems development  sales  and general managerial resources 
we may not be able to manage this growth successfully 
the continued expansion effort on which our future growth depends has inherent risks  such as the following any new or enhanced services we develop might not meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our current or potential clients  we might not succeed in developing new or enhanced services  and we might not succeed in entering new geographical markets 
if we are unable to maintain the integrity and reliability of our data  our business could be harmed 
our success depends on our clients confidence in the comprehensiveness  accuracy  and reliability of the data we provide 
we believe that we take adequate precautions to safeguard the completeness and accuracy of our data and that the information is generally current  comprehensive  and accurate 
but the task of establishing and maintaining this quality while we grow is challenging 
we cannot guarantee that we can sustain those efforts 
if we cannot maintain the quality of our data  we could experience reduced demand for our services and could be exposed to lawsuits claiming damages resulting from inaccurate data 
we may not be able to adapt to the rapid technological changes to the internet and internet products 
to be successful  we must adapt to the rapid technological changes to the internet and internet products by continually enhancing our web site and introducing and integrating new services and products to capitalize on the technological advances in the internet 
although in the next year we expect to migrate all of our information products to a web based platform  this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate our services and products with the internet s technological advances 
the collection  storage  management and dissemination of commercial real estate information from a centralized database on the internet is a recent and evolving development 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions 
these factors are exacerbated by the rapid technological change experienced in the computer and software industries 
we could incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes 
if we incurred significant costs without adequate results or we are unable to adapt to rapid technological changes  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our increasing use of the internet and the world wide web exposes us to regulatory and other uncertainties 
most of our clients currently receive their costar data via the internet 
we are in the process of making substantially all our services accessible through a standard web browser format 
this exposes us to various uncertainties arising from the future course of development of the internet and the world wide web 
governments in the united states and abroad might adopt laws or regulations applicable to internet commerce that could harm our business by  for example  regulating our transmissions over the internet or exposing our business to new taxes in various jurisdictions 
user concerns about the privacy and security of internet distributed communications might impede the growth of our business 
we may need to expend substantial resources to protect against security breaches on our web site or in our internet communications 
we cannot assure you that our internet products will achieve market acceptance 
we intend to continue to increase our reliance on the internet for delivery of our services and products 
as a result  our future profitability will increasingly rely upon the use of our information services and transaction support products on the internet 
our ability to obtain market acceptance for our internet products will depend on the following factors our ability to transition our customers from the use of our services and products on cd rom to the use of these services and products on the internet in a timely and efficient manner  our customers acceptance of  and their ability to adapt to the use of  our existing and future services and products on the internet  and our ability to anticipate and adapt to the changing internet market 
if our internet based information services or transaction support products are not received favorably by our current customers  their use of our other products may be negatively affected or cause new customers to choose a competitive service over ours 
unsatisfactory internet performance  interruption or failure could have an adverse effect on our business 
our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site  the internet and the world wide web 
problems with the internet or web may impede the development of our business for a number of reasons 
if the number of internet users or their use of internet resources continues to grow  we may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
growth in internet usage that is not matched by comparable growth of the infrastructure supporting the internet could result in slower response time  cause outright failure of the internet  or otherwise adversely affect usage 
we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information on the internet 
because the content in our database is distributed to others  we may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against internet services in the past 
we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or information on our web site supplied by third parties 
our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims 
even to the extent these claims do not result in liability to us  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims 
our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our service to users 
temporary or permanent outages of our computers and software or telecommunications equipment could have an adverse effect on our business 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our database  computers and software  telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire  power loss  security breaches  and telecommunications failures 
any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident  equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business 
our core computer services and networking equipment are located in a climate controlled  fire and security protected central location 
we keep off site backup copies of all data contained in our database  maintain a back up power supply and equipment  and stockpile spare parts 
these measures may not  however  adequately protect our business 
we may be unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property 
the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies  database and software 
we rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws  nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions  license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we cannot guarantee that we will always succeed in this effort 
our business could be significantly harmed if we do not succeed in protecting our intellectual property 
the same would be true if a court should find that our services infringe other persons intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property lawsuits in which we might become involved  either as a plaintiff  such as in the loopnet lawsuit  or as a defendant  could cost us much time and money 
international expansion may result in new business risks 
if we expand internationally  this expansion could subject us to new business risks  including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign commercial real estate markets  difficulties in managing foreign operations  limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  cost of enforcement of contractual obligations  impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  andrew c 
florance 
our business requires highly skilled technical  sales  management  web development  marketing and research personnel  who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers 
because we are expanding rapidly  we continue to need an increased number of management and support personnel 
to retain and attract key personnel  we use various measures  including multi year employment agreements containing confidentiality and non competition agreements  a stock option plan  and incentive bonuses for key executive officers 
we are the beneficiary of a key person life insurance policy on mr 
florance 
these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we needs or to offset the impact on our business of a loss of mr 
florance or other key employees 
if we are unable to continue to develop our sales force  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in order to support our growth  we need to substantially increase the size of our direct sales force 
our ability to increase our direct sales force involves a number of risks  including the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel  our ability to integrate and motivate additional sales and sales support personnel  our ability to manage a multi location sales organization  and the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive 
competition could render our services uncompetitive 
the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
we believe our proprietary database and content compete favorably with our competitors 
however  many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  may have longer operating histories in the internet market  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  greater user traffic and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  make more attractive offers to potential employees  subscribers  distribution partners and content providers and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in internet user requirements 
cyclical downturns and consolidation in the commercial real estate industry could have an adverse effect on our business 
our business depends on conditions in the commercial real estate industry  including businesses that supply or invest in that industry 
changes in the commercial real estate market may affect demand for our services 
the traditional economic downturns in the commercial real estate industry could harm our business 
these changes could decrease renewal rates  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
also  companies in this industry are consolidating  often in order to reduce expenses 
consolidation could reduce the number of our existing clients  reduce the size of our target market and increase our clients bargaining power 
any of these factors could adversely affect our business 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations  we may need additional capital 
to date  we have financed our operations through cash from profitable operations in our established markets  the sale of our stock and borrowing money 
if we do not generate enough cash from operations to finance our business in the future  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
selling additional stock could dilute the equity interests of our stockholders 
if we borrow money  we will have to pay interest and agree to restrictions that may limit our operating flexibility 
we may not be able to obtain funds needed to finance our operations at all or may be able to obtain them only on unattractive terms 
problems with our software could impair the use of our services 
the software underlying our services is complex and may contain undetected errors 
we have previously discovered errors in our proprietary software 
despite testing  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of that software 
any errors could result in adverse publicity  impaired use of our services  loss of revenues  cost increases and legal claims by customers 
all these factors could seriously damage our business  operating results and financial condition 
market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and  like most stocks  it will continue to fluctuate in the future 
the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  changes in analysts estimates of our earnings  announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services  general conditions in the commercial real estate industry  developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights  regulatory developments  and economic or other factors 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the shares of internet related and other technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
stock ownership by executive officers and directors provides substantial influence over matters requiring a vote of stockholders 
our executive officers and directors  and entities affiliated with them  beneficially own a sufficient number of our outstanding common stock to exercise substantial influence over the election of directors and other matters requiring a vote of stockholders 
this concentrated ownership might delay or prevent a change in control and may impede or prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
our charter documents contain provisions that could impede third party acquisitions 
our governing corporate documents contain provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by our stockholders to change management more difficult 
these provisions include a requirement that stockholders give us advance notice of certain nominations for our board of directors and of new business for any stockholder meeting  a prohibition on stockholders calling special meetings  and a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent 
our certificate of incorporation also allows our board of directors to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights of those shares without a vote by the stockholders 
the rights of holders of common stock may be harmed by the rights of the holders of this blank check preferred stock 
if we issue any preferred stock  an outside party may find it more difficult to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
applying these provisions could delay or prevent a change in control  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
