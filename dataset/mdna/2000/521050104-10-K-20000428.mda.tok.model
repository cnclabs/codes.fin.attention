results of operations the company substantially consummated the acquisition of stanley mining services pty  limited stanley at the end of july the stanley acquisition 
stanley has been reflected in layne christensen s results of operations beginning august  the stanley acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
with the stanley acquisition and other smaller acquisitions thereafter  the percentage of the company s revenues and operating income tied to the mining industry has increased substantially 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services and products depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the decline in the prices of various metals has continued to adversely impact the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies and has had  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on the company 
at the end of each fiscal year  potential impairment with respect to the company s long lived assets is reviewed by comparing the sum of undiscounted projected future cash flows attributable to each business unit to the carrying value of the assets of that business unit 
projected future cash flows for each business unit are estimated for a period approximating the remaining lives of that unit s long lived assets  based on earnings history  market conditions and assumptions reflected in internal operating plans and strategies 
under this analysis  the company has determined that the cash flows from the mineral exploration business would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of its long lived assets and  therefore  that the value of such assets is not impaired 
the projected future cash flows represent management s best estimates 
because these estimates are based on subjective assumptions  an impairment write down may be required in the future if the projected future cash flows decline 
the following table  which is derived from the company s consolidated financial statements as discussed in item  presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship which certain items reflected in the company s statements of income bear to revenues and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amount of such items period to period

this division is intended to vertically integrate the company s water well drilling and maintenance and environmental drilling product lines 
in conjunction with the formation of this division  service revenues for these product lines for and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the following table and in comparisons of fiscal to fiscal thereafter

comparison of fiscal to fiscal results of operations revenues for fiscal decreased  or  to  compared to  for fiscal integrated groundwater services revenues increased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal the year to year increase in integrated groundwater services revenues was primarily the result of increased demand for certain domestic water related services 
mineral exploration drilling revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the decrease for the year was primarily a result of lower demand for the company s services in areas outside north america as a result of the decrease in exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies in those areas 
geotechnical construction revenues increased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal the increase in geotechnical revenues was primarily a result of the company s continued development of recently purchased technologies to serve this market 
product sales decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the decrease was a result of the lower demand for the company s products in the mining industry as previously discussed 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to reduced profits at the company s manufacturing facility and at the company s mineral exploration locations in australasia and africa 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase for the year was primarily a result of expenses arising from various operations acquired during fiscal depreciation and amortization increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was attributable to property additions and various acquisitions that occurred during the year  partially offset by lower capital spending in the mineral exploration division 
equity in earnings losses of foreign affiliates was  for fiscal compared to  for the last year 
the decrease was primarily a result of lower exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies in latin america 
income taxes were a benefit of zero for fiscal compared to an expense of  for the last year 
the unusual effective rate for the year was primarily a result of the increased impact of certain non deductible expenses in light of lower taxable earnings in the respective periods  combined with a reduction in the amount of earnings from certain foreign affiliates and subsidiaries relative to the company s overall earnings 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal results of operations revenues for fiscal decreased  or  to  compared to  for fiscal water well drilling and maintenance revenues increased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal the increase in water well drilling and maintenance revenues was primarily the result of the acquisition of certain assets of hydro group  inc  a new jersey based drilling contractor  in march the hydro acquisition 
additionally  the company experienced stronger demand for services at various domestic locations 
mineral exploration drilling revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of lower demand for the company s services as a result of the decrease in exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies 
the decrease was less than it otherwise would have been as fiscal included a full year of revenues following the stanley acquisition 
geotechnical drilling revenues decreased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal exclusive of the company s ground freeze project in timmins  ontario  canada  for echo bay mines  ltd 
the timmins project  which was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  geotechnical drilling revenues increased in fiscal the increase in the base geotechnical business revenues was primarily a result of increased activity in this market 
environmental drilling revenue increased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal the company believes the improvement was largely attributable to an increase in the number of larger and more technically demanding projects  which were substantially completed during the year

income tax expense was  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal the effective tax rate for the year ended january   increased to compared to for the year ended january  this was primarily a result of a combination of a reduction in the amount of equity in earnings of foreign affiliates on which income tax is normally not provided as foreign tax credits are generally available to offset the tax liability and the increased impact of certain non deductible expenses resulting from lower earnings for the fiscal year 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large drilling contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to drilling sites and the ability to drill  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year

year discussion the year yk problem relates to the fact that many computer programs use only two digits to refer to a year 
as a result  many computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the yk issue 
other than the company s financial reporting systems  the nature of the company s business is such that it is generally not reliant upon date sensitive information technology it and non information technology non it systems 
the company believes that issues related to yk compliance of its it and non it systems did not have a material adverse impact on its business operations or financial results 
to date  the company has not experienced any major disruptions related to the yk date change 
in addition  we are not aware of significant yk disruptions impacting our customers or suppliers 
we will continue to monitor our critical systems over the next several months but do not anticipate a significant impact as a result of the yk date change 
the company has primarily utilized internal resources to assess  test  remediate and implement software and equipment related to yk 
incremental cost directly related to yk issues for the company were not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rates on variable rate debt  equity risk on investments  and foreign exchange rates giving rise to translation and transaction gains and losses 
the company centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
a description of the company s variable rate debt is in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on page of this form k 
assuming then existing debt levels  an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would impact the company s interest expense by  and  at january  and  respectively 
the company s investments are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the investments are carried at market value and are held for long term investing purposes rather than trading purposes 
operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico  canada  indonesia  italy and thailand 
the operations are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted operating income for the years ended january  and by approximately  and  respectively 
this represents approximately ten percent of the international segment operating income after adjusting for primarily us dollar based operations 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s consolidated statements of income reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican and african operations which use the us dollar as their functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses for  and were not significant
