quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of its debt 
see also note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal was generated by quiksilver europe 
the functional currency of quiksilver europe is the french franc 
however  quiksilver europe sells in various european countries and collects at future dates in the customers local currencies and purchases raw materials and finished goods in us dollars and other european currencies 
accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
quiksilver europe enters into foreign currency contracts in managing its foreign exchange risk on foreign currency transactions and does not use the contracts for trading purposes 
the company s goal is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual french franc net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
firmly committed transactions are hedged with forward exchange contracts 
gains and losses related to hedges of firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized when the hedged transaction occurs 
for financial reporting purposes  quiksilver europe s statements of income are translated from french francs into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during the reporting period 
when the french franc strengthens compared to the us dollar  there is a positive effect on quiksilver europe s results as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
conversely  when the us dollar strengthens  there is a negative effect 
in fiscal  the us dollar strengthened somewhat compared to the french franc  which had the corresponding negative effect on the company s reported results for fiscal net sales of quiksilver europe as measured in french francs increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  but as measured in us dollars and reported in the company s consolidated statement of income  quiksilver europe s net sales increased

the company recognized a foreign exchange gain amounting to  in fiscal related to these advances 
certain countries in which quiksilver europe operates adopted the euro as a legal currency effective january  euro notes and coins are expected to begin circulation after a three year transition period on january  quiksilver europe has analyzed whether the conversion to the euro will materially affect its business operations 
quiksilver europe s information systems are capable of processing transactions in euros 
additionally  quiksilver europe is planning to upgrade its information systems through fiscal to enhance its capability to process transactions and keep records in euros 
while the company is uncertain as to the ultimate impact of the conversion  the company does not expect costs in connection with the euro conversion to be material 
interest rates the majority of the company s lines of credit and long term debt  with a total balance of  at october   bears interest based on libor 
the weighted average interest rate at october  was 
if interest rates were to increase by  the estimated impact on the company s consolidated financial statements would be to reduce net income by approximately  after taxes based on amounts outstanding and rates in effect at october
