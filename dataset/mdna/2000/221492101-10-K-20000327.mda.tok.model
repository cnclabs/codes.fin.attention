overview background cost u less began operations in by opening a mid sized warehouse club style store in maui  hawaii 
the company s store concept proved successful in the more remote  and in many ways more challenging  island markets 
the company began experimenting in late with similar stores in various mainland markets 
over the course of a three year period  the company opened six mainland stores and seven island stores  but  over time  found that most of the mainland stores did not meet the company s performance expectations 
the company therefore focused on its core competencies in operating island stores and began closing its mainland stores 
currently only one mainland store remains open and serves as an efficient testing ground for new operating and merchandising methods 
the company intends to retain this store while targeting its future growth on island markets 
review in  three new stores were opened  curacao  netherlands antilles in march  rotorua  new zealand in november  and porirua  new zealand in december 
additionally  the company opened buying offices in auckland  new zealand and sydney  australia  to support the operations in new zealand and fiji 
the fijian stores were opened in  and represented the company s first foreign island country stores 
historically  the company s island stores achieved profitability within the first year of operation 
the curacao store is operating within company expectations 
the stores in fiji and new zealand have performed below company expectations 
the two fijian stores have shown improved performance  but continue to perform below company expectations 
compared to other island markets in which the company operates  new zealand has significantly more competitive market challenges 
additionally  new zealand has established and accepted regional brands and goods that compete with the us brands offered by the company 
the company is taking several actions in an effort to improve new zealand performance 
see strategy on the succeeding page 
the company began implementing a strategy to increase its business to business sales 
business to business sales business sales occur through our retail stores and distribution facilities 
business sales through the company s distribution facilities represent   and of the company s total sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
the gross margin on these sales are lower than retail gross margins 
however  because there are generally lower handling costs associated with these sales  these sales are generally profitable and complement the retail business 
the gross margin on business sales through the distribution facilities were in  compared to in and we anticipate increased business sales in fiscal the company benefits from attractive store level economics and favorable returns on investment at its island stores 
the company s nine island stores opened for all of fiscal generated average per store net sales of million  average net sales per square foot of  average annual per store contribution store gross profit less direct store expenses of approximately  and average annual contribution before depreciation of  the company uses the entire interior space of its store  including receiving and office space  in calculating average net sales per square foot 
the company receives  consolidates and loads merchandise at its distribution facilities  then ships merchandise to its island stores in fully loaded containers 
the company also receives local goods delivered directly to the stores 
in store inventory is managed primarily by electronically monitoring sell through of merchandise and maintaining efficient distribution facilities 
inventory turns in decreased to compared to in and the reduction was primarily due to the impact of under performing stores in fiji  and to a lesser extent  new zealand 
strategy the company plans to take several actions to improve performance in new zealand and fiji 
the company believes it is the first warehouse club concept in the new zealand market  and that through improved merchandising  promotional activity  implementing a business sales strategy  and more experienced store management  the new zealand market will become more accustomed to the warehouse club concept  and that store performance can be improved 
furthermore  the auckland  new zealand buying office will be downsized  which the company believes will reduce costs 
buying responsibility will be realigned  with the corporate buying office coordinating overall buying activities 
in fiji  performance has been improving  and the company plans to improve the merchandising  and increase the business sales 
while management believes the actions described above can significantly improve profitability in these stores  there can be no assurance that the actions described above will be successful 
with a relatively small base of stores  under performing stores can have a materially adverse impact on company performance 
the company is developing a business plan that will define how and where the company will achieve growth beginning in the plan will look to markets in the pacific and caribbean with the attributes that typify the company s most successful stores 
the plan will return the company to its primary strategy of entering island markets ahead of larger warehouse club competitors  entering markets that have acceptance and demand for us goods where supply is minimal  and leveraging the company island operations expertise  systems  and merchandising methods 
to prepare for growth beginning  the company is improving merchandising methods  systems  and information  and reviewing the key attributes associated with successful stores 
business sales through company stores and distribution facilities are expected to increase in fiscal year the additional sales  although at lower margins than retail margins  are profitable and more fully utilize the company s logistic capabilities and facilities 
recently  a membership warehouse club announced their intent to enter the st 
thomas market  where the company has an established and successful store 
the company will be developing and implementing marketing and other strategies to prepare for this new competition 
however  the company s gross margins are generally lower for those stores in markets where traditional warehouse clubs and discount retailers operate 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s net sales represented by certain consolidated income statement data 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales gross margin operating expenses store general and administrative store opening 
store closing operating income interest expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to a full year of sales from the two additional stores opened in fiscal  and the curacao store that opened in march comparable sales stores open at least months increased during fiscal  compared to in with one new store planned in fiscal  sales growth is expected to slow from the sales growth of in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to increased business sales which carry lower margins  but are executed at minimal direct expense

store expenses 
store expenses increased million in to million from million in as a percent of sales  store expenses decreased to in from in the increase in store expenses was primarily due to a full year of expenses being required in for two additional stores opened in  and the new stores opened in the decrease in store expenses as a percent of sales was primarily due to higher sales volume in compared to  while variable expenses increased only general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million in to million compared to million in the increase was due to establishing the new zealand and australia buying offices  and personnel additions at the corporate office  primarily in information technology  to support system enhancements and improved store communications 
it is expected that the rate of increase will slow in as the company is better positioned to support growth 
store opening expense 
store opening expenses increased 
million to million in  compared to 
million in the increase was primarily due to the costs to open curacao in the first quarter and the two new zealand stores in the fourth quarter of in  the company re located the st 
thomas store  and opened two fijian stores 
in addition  store opening expense included costs to open the st 
maarten store 
the st 
maarten store is planned in open in we expect store opening costs to decline in  due to one planned new store in net interest expense 
net interest expense increased  to  in due primarily to additional borrowings incurred during to fund the construction and opening of new and future stores 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased  to million from million in the increase was primarily due to a same store sales increase of  which was offset by the loss of sales from two closed stores in late the sales from two additional stores in were further offset by a decrease in business sales of million in gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin was due to the closure of two low margin mainland stores in  and increased sales in higher margin departments such as the fresh meat and perishable departments  and decreased distribution costs resulting from higher volumes

as a percentage of net sales  store expenses decreased to in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  in  or  to million from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate employees resulting from the increased complexities from foreign operations  and in costs directly associated with being a public company  including  but not limited to  professional fees  travel  increased insurance  and investor relations costs 
store closing expenses 
store closing expenses decreased to  in from million in the decrease resulted from one store being closed in june in connection with the completion of a new store in st 
thomas 
in  the company closed two domestic stores 
the store closure in was attributable to the company s only island store not built to company specifications 
damage from a hurricane in was not satisfactorily repaired and  as a result  the company reached an agreement for an early termination of the lease 
interest expense

on may   the company renewed and increased its line of credit with a financial institution to the amount of million 
the line of credit expires may  since the line of credit matures annually  the company is currently in the process of renewing the line of credit for another year  which it expects to complete before may  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the company s option of the financial institution s prime rate or at libor plus at december  
the collateral for the line of credit consists of inventories  equipment and trade accounts receivable 
the line of credit contains certain covenants  including requiring the company to maintain minimum tangible net worth and minimum ratios of current assets to current liabilities  debt to tangible net worth and quarterly cash flow and must obtain the consent of the lender to i pay dividends  ii purchase or sell assets or incur indebtedness  other than in the ordinary course of business  iii make loans to  or investments in  any other person  iv enter into a merger or other business combination  or v make capital expenditures in excess of a specified limit as of and for the year ended december  the company was in compliance with all such covenants

the company expects to continue to utilize the line of credit facility this year to finance the inventory for the new st 
maarten store 
in november  the company entered into a million note payable for the construction of its new store in st 
maarten 
the note payable carries interest at the prime rate plus at december   and is secured by a first security interest on the st 
maarten leasehold interest and personal property 
the company expects to finance a substantial portion of its merchandise inventory cost through a combination of vendor and bank financing 
the company estimates that the st 
maarten store will require approximately million of inventory  approximately half of which will be funded by vendors 
the company believes that amounts available under its various credit facilities  existing cash available for working capital purposes  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to open the st 
maarten store and fund company operations through fiscal year compliance in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in critical information technology and noninformation technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
the company did not incur significant costs related to the year issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates stores in foreign countries and has market risks associated with foreign currencies 
however  sales are primarily made in us cash or foreign currencies with minimal trade credit extended and no borrowings exist in foreign currencies 
cash deposited from sales are remitted back to the us bank account  routinely 
because of the minimal trade credit  the company s exposure to foreign currency market risk is not considered significant and is not concentrated in any single currency 
management does not believe that it experiences any significant market risk from foreign currencies
