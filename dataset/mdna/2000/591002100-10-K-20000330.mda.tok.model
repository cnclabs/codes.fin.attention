the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the detailed information in this form k and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this form k and presented by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on renewals of subscription based services the company derived approximately of its total revenues in from subscriptions to the company s research and advisory services 
in the year ended december   the company derived approximately of its total revenues from subscriptions to its research and advisory services 
approximately and of the company s research and advisory service clients renewed at least one subscription in and  respectively 
the company  however  may not be successful in maintaining its subscription renewal rates 
commencing in and continuing in  the company experienced a shift in client demand towards more consultative  solution oriented products such as strategic consulting services 
with the advent of the internet  information alone  without analysis in context of a client s environment  will have less value 
in addition to this  the company s ability to renew subscriptions is subject to a number of risks  including the following the company may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality and timely analysis and advice to its clients 
the company may not be able to hire and retain a large and growing number of highly talented professionals in a very competitive job market 
the company may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of its clients 
the company may not be able to deliver products and services of the quality and timeliness to withstand competition 
if the company is unable to successfully maintain its subscription renewal rates or sustain the necessary level of performance  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
dependence on non recurring strategic consulting engagements the company derived approximately and of the its total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively from strategic consulting engagements 
the company currently anticipates continued growth of revenues from strategic consulting engagements 
strategic consulting engagements vary in number  size and scope and typically are project based and non recurring 
the company s ability to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements is subject to a number of risks  including the following the company may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality and timely consulting services to its clients 
the company may not be able to hire and retain a large and growing number of highly talented professionals in a very competitive job market 
the company may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of its clients 
the company may not be able to deliver consulting services of the quality and timeliness to withstand competition 
if the company is not able to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company expects future operating results to fluctuate due to several factors  many of which are not in the company s control the disproportionately large portion of the company s research and advisory services subscriptions that expire in the fourth quarter of each year  the level and timing of renewals of subscriptions to the company s research and advisory services  the mix of research and advisory services revenues versus strategic consulting and research reports revenues  the number  size and scope of strategic consulting engagements in which the company is engaged  the degree of completion of such engagements and the company s ability to complete such engagements  the timing and amount of new business generated by the company  the mix of domestic versus international business  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services and delivery methodologies  the timing of the hiring of research analysts  consultants  and sales representatives  employee utilization rates and the accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing strategic consulting engagements  changes in the spending patterns of the company s clients  the company s accounts receivable collection experience  changes in market demand for it research and analysis and strategic consulting services  and competitive conditions in the industry 
due to these factors  the company believes period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results of operations 
the potential fluctuations in the company s operating results make it likely that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
risks associated with international operations net revenues attributable to international clients represented approximately of the company s total research and advisory services revenues for the year ended december  and approximately of the company s total research and advisory services revenues for the year ended december  the company sells its products internationally through a network of independent sales representative organizations 
the company assumes significantly greater risk by selling through independent sales representative organizations than through a direct employee sales force 
these risks to the company include greater accounts receivable collection risk because the company relies on the sales representative organization to invoice and collect receivables  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  the financial health of individual sales representative organizations  developing and managing relationships with sales representative organizations  greater difficulty in maintaining direct client contact  fluctuations in exchange rates  political  social  and economic conditions in various jurisdictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its international operations 
expansion into new geographic territories may require considerable management and financial resources and may negatively impact the company s near term results of operations 
if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
risks of failing to anticipate changing market needs the company s success depends in part upon its ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt its products and services to meet the changing information and analysis needs of it users 
commencing in and continuing in  the company experienced a shift in client demand towards more consultative  solution oriented products such as strategic consulting services 
with the advent of the internet  information alone  without analysis in context of a client s environment  will have less value 
in addition to this  frequent and often dramatic changes  including the following  characterize the it industry introduction of new products and obsolescence of others  changing client demands concerning the marketing and delivery of the company s products and services  shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants  paradigm shifts with respect to system architectures  and changing objectives and expectations of it users and vendors 
this environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to the company s ability to provide its clients with current and timely analysis and advice on issues of importance to them 
the company commits substantial resources to meeting these challenges 
if the company fails to provide insightful timely analysis of developments and assessment of technologies and trends in a manner that meets changing market needs  such a failure could have a material and adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
dependence on ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the company needs to hire  train and retain a significant number of additional qualified employees to execute its strategy and support its growth 
in particular  the company needs trained research analysts  consultants  sales representatives and product development and operations staff 
the company continues to experience intense competition in recruiting and retaining qualified employees 
the pool of experienced candidates is small  and  the company competes for qualified employees against many companies  including gartner group  that have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
if the company is unable to successfully hire  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
competition the it research and analysis and consulting industry is extremely competitive 
the company competes directly with other independent providers of similar services and indirectly with the internal staffs of current and prospective client organizations 
the company s principal direct competitor  gartner group  has a substantially longer operating history and has considerably greater financial resources and market share than the company 
the company also competes indirectly with larger electronic and print media companies and consulting firms 
the company s indirect competitors  many of which have substantially greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than the company  could choose to compete directly against the company in the future 
the company s market has few barriers to entry 
new competitors could easily compete against the company in one or more market segments addressed by the company s research and advisory services or strategic consulting services 
the company s current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more effective than the company s products and services 
competitors may also produce their products and services at less cost and market them more effectively 
if the company is unable to successfully compete against existing or new competitors  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and would likely result in pricing pressure and loss of market share 
risks associated with new product development the company s future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire new products and services that address specific industry and business sectors  changes in client requirements and technological changes in the it industry 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service is inherently risky and costly 
assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service is also risky and costly 
commencing in and continuing in  the company experienced a shift in client demand towards more consultative  solution oriented products
