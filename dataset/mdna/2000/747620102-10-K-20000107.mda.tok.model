these continued increases are a result of the company s growth strategies through internal investments as well as acquisitions 
the company s internal growth investments  principally at the macsteel division and at piper impact  inc piper impact were focused toward capacity expansions  new product offerings  quality improvements  and enhanced customer service capabilities 
acquisitions divestitures since october  in april  the company completed the sale of its lasalle steel company lasalle subsidiary 
lasalle s results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
for business segment reporting purposes  lasalle s data was previously classified as cold finished steel bars 
in october  the company  through its dutch subsidiary  piper impact europe bv piper impact europe  purchased the net assets of advanced metal forming cv  a dutch limited partnership  for approximately million 
the company s income statement for the twelve months ended october  does not include results for piper impact europe 
in december  the company completed the sale of its tubing operations tubing operations  comprised of michigan seamless tube  gulf states tube  and the tube group administrative office 
the results of the tubing operations have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
for business segment reporting purposes  these businesses were previously classified as steel tubes 
two small divisions  heat treat division and nitrosteel division  which were previously included with this segment  were retained by the company and are now included in the engineered steel bars segment 
in october  the company acquired the stock of decatur aluminum corp  a decatur  alabama based aluminum sheet manufacturer for approximately million 
the newly acquired company has been renamed nichols aluminum alabama  inc nichols aluminum alabama in alignment with quanex s other aluminum mill sheet businesses in its nichols aluminum division 
nichols aluminum alabama s operations include cold rolling aluminum sheet to specific gauge  annealing  leveling  custom painting and slitting to width 
on december   the company announced that it had signed a contract to acquire the assets of alcoa s fort lupton  colorado based aluminum sheet production facility for million plus working capital value which is estimated at million 
consummation of the sale is subject to government approval 
the acquisition of the fort lupton mill will increase the casting  cold finishing and value added painting capacities of nichols aluminum  quanex s aluminum sheet business 
the fort lupton mill can produce more than million pounds annually of high grade aluminum sheet for a variety of applications  including beverage cans and other food packaging  home furnishing  and other consumer durable products 
business segments the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas for the fiscal year ended sfas requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
pursuant to sfas  the company has three reportable segments engineered steel bars  aluminum mill sheet products  and engineered products 
the engineered steel bar segment consists of engineered steel bars manufacturing  steel bar and tube heat treating services and steel bar and tube wear and corrosion resistant finishing services 
the aluminum mill sheet segment manufactures mill finished and coated aluminum sheet 
the engineered products segment manufactures impact extruded aluminum and steel parts  aluminum window and patio door screens  window frames and other roll formed products and stamped shapes 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the company s three business segments years ended october  in thousands engineered steel bars net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    aluminum mill sheet products net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    engineered products net sales    operating income loss    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    results include three weeks of nichols aluminum alabama s operations acquired october  see note to financial statements data does not include the results of piper impact europe 
however  identifiable assets as of october  include piper impact europe  acquired october  see note to financial statements during  piper impact recorded a million non recurring restructuring charge as the result of impairment as described by statement of financial accounting no 
this restructuring charge is included in operating income 
see note to financial statements at the start of fiscal  quanex changed its inventory valuation method for measuring segment results from lifo to fifo 
this change has no impact on consolidated results  which remain lifo based 
prior data have not been restated above 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the engineered steel bar business posted record annual operating income  benefiting from strong demand in the transportation markets and favorable raw material costs  which helped to offset softness in other markets 
pricing has been under intense pressure  and it is expected to continue in the year ahead 
in fiscal  macsteel finished its phase iv expansion project  doubling production capacity for macplus cold finished steel bars  its most premium value added product 
work continues on phase v  which will increase capacity at macsteel s engineered bar mills and the macsteel heat treating division and will improve operational efficiency at macsteel nitrosteel 
the aluminum mill sheet business achieved a breakthrough year  consistently improving its quarterly performance during fiscal operating income  which increased on higher sales was helped by the acquisition of nichols aluminum alabama and improved spreads from lower aluminum scrap prices as well as benefits resulting from the rotary furnace project at its mini mill in davenport  iowa 
the backlog for the first quarter is seasonally normal with some pricing pressures and short lead times 
the engineered products business also had significantly improved earnings on slightly lower sales 
adjusting for the one time restructuring charge of million recorded at piper impact in fiscal and the resulting lower amortization  the operating income from the engineered products business improved by in fiscal lower raw material costs  stringent cost controls and implementation of lean manufacturing techniques contributed to the success 
however  fierce competition in the air bag market will continue to pose significant challenges for piper impact until it can diversify its business in new markets with new products 
the fabricated products businesses  amsco and homeshield fabricated products  continue to expand their markets by leveraging their product design and engineering expertise to develop applications for new customers 
outlook the company currently expects that the overall business levels for fiscal should be similar to those experienced during  except for its engineered products business which is experiencing product mix change resulting in lower sales 
domestic and global market factors will also impact the company and any slowdown in the us economy could affect demand and pricing for many of the company s products 
improved financial results will be dependent upon  among other things  whether the continued strength of the economy can be sustained  improvements in the markets which the company serves  successful new product development efforts at engineered products business and whether the improvements in the price spreads of aluminum mill sheet products can be sustained 
compared to net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase reflects higher net sales at the aluminum mill sheet business partially offset by lower net sales at the company s engineered steel bar and engineered products businesses 
nichols aluminum alabama  which was acquired in october  contributed a full year of sales in fiscal net sales from the company s engineered steel bar business for fiscal  were million  representing a decrease of million  or  when compared to fiscal this decline was principally due to the reduced demand in some of the durable goods market  inventory adjustments by some customers and pricing pressures resulting from global sourcing of engineered bars and forged components 
net sales for fiscal from the company s aluminum mill sheet products business increased by million or to million when compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to the acquisition of nichols aluminum alabama in october of net sales from the company s engineered products business for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million  or from last year 
the decrease was largely due to reduced demand for older generation aluminum airbag components at the piper facilities  partially offset by sales of new non airbag products as well as increased demand for traditional window and door products in the fabricated products division 
operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million 
this represents an increase of million  or  when compared to the operating income in fiscal of million  excluding the one time million restructuring charge 
during fiscal all business segments had increased operating income  partially offset by increased expenses at the corporate office for year readiness efforts  relocation expenses and consulting expenses for systems implementation 
at the start of fiscal year  quanex changed its inventory valuation method for measuring segment results from lifo to fifo 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion 
this change has no impact on consolidated results  which remain lifo based 
operating income from the company s engineered steel bar business was million for fiscal  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal the increase achieved  despite the lower net sales  was largely due to the higher spreads resulting from lower material prices  increased sales of value added products and productivity improvements realized from the phase iii project completed in additionally  approximately million of benefits were realized as a result of an insurance recovery and a litigation settlement received in fiscal operating income for fiscal from the company s aluminum mill sheet products business was million  representing an increase of million or from last year 
this increase was largely due to higher sales and operating efficiencies realized from the acquisition of nichols aluminum alabama and improved spreads resulting from lower aluminum scrap prices as well as benefits from the new rotary furnaces and the dross recovery system 
also  the operating income in fiscal was based on inventory valuation using lifo method see note to the financial statements 
operating income from the company s engineered products business was million for fiscal for comparison purposes  fiscal operating loss of million should be adjusted for the one time restructuring charge of million and the decreased amortization expense of million  both recorded at piper impact 
when compared to the adjusted operating income of million  fiscal operating income from the engineered products business represents an increase of million or 
the improvement was largely due to lower material costs and some success at cost management measures 
in addition to the three operating segments mentioned above  operating expenses for corporate and other for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million over the million recorded in fiscal included in corporate and other are the corporate office expenses  impact of inventory accounting using lifo method and inter segment eliminations 
see notes and to the financial statements regarding lifo valuation method of inventory accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or in fiscal as compared to last year 
this increase is largely a result of the acquisition of nichols aluminum alabama  year readiness efforts  relocation expenses and consulting expenses for system implementations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million  or in fiscal as compared to last year 
the increase is principally due to increased depreciation at the engineered steel bar and aluminum mill sheet products businesses for recently completed projects as well as the inclusion of nichols aluminum alabama  which was acquired in october  partially offset by lower amortization at the engineered products business 
interest expense interest expense decreased by thousand in fiscal primarily resulting from the purchase of million face value subordinated debentures 
capitalized interest capitalized interest decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the completion of significant capital projects at macsteel during other  net other  net decreased by thousand in fiscal as compared to last year primarily as a result of reduced investment income on lower cash balances 
income from continuing operations the company earned income from continuing operations of million in fiscal this represents an increase of million or when compared to fiscal income from continuing operations of million  excluding the restructuring charge 
the increase in fiscal was principally due to increased operating earnings from all three business segments of the company and inclusion of a full year s earnings from nichols aluminum alabama  which was acquired in october net income fiscal net income was million  compared to million for fiscal included in net income for fiscal were thousand of extraordinary items representing net gain on early extinguishment of debt 
fiscal net income included an after tax non recurring restructuring charge of million at piper impact and an after tax gain of million on the sale of discontinued operations 
compared to net sales net sales for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million when compared to fiscal this increase reflects higher net sales in all three business segments as well as an increase of million resulting from sales to discontinued operations which were previously reflected as intersegment sales and eliminated in these sales are now third party sales and are not eliminated in piper impact europe  which was acquired in october  contributed a full year of sales in fiscal net sales for fiscal from the company s engineered steel bar business were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a better mix of product sales with a higher percentage of macplus and bearing steels 
net sales from the company s aluminum mill sheets products business for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to strong demand  which yielded a increase in volume 
net sales from the engineered products group increased million to million 
the majority of the increase resulted from the addition of piper impact europe offset by a decrease in net sales at piper impact 
restructuring charge during the year ended october   the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to its subsidiary  piper impact 
components of this special charge include million for goodwill impairment  million for impairment of property  plant and equipment  and thousand for severance benefits to be paid to employees of the park city  utah plant 
piper impact experienced significant changes in market conditions and the relationship with its major customer in fiscal  which led to substantial declines in sales and operating cash flow 
management began an evaluation of the operations of piper impact in august as a result of this evaluation  in september  management approved a plan to close the park city  utah facility and move its production to the new albany  mississippi facility 
due to the significance of the changes discussed above and the decision to close one of the acquired production facilities  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of all of the assets of piper impact  excluding the new steel plant  as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management concluded from the results of this evaluation that a significant impairment of intangible as well as long lived assets had occurred 
an impairment charge was required because estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from management s estimates 
the one time restructuring charge resulted in an after tax impact on net income of million or per share 
operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million 
included in operating income was the one time million restructuring charge discussed above 
operating income excluding this restructuring charge was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal primary contributing factors to this increase were increased sales and operating income from the engineered steel bar and aluminum mill sheet business and the inclusion of a full year of piper impact europe in the engineered products business 
these improvements were partly offset by lower operating income from piper impact of the engineered products business 
operating income from the company s engineered steel bar business for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was principally due to increased sales from strong demand in the transportation markets as well as lower material prices 
these results represented a record year for this business 
operating income from the company s aluminum mill sheet products business for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was principally due to increased volume and net sales accompanied by lower scrap prices 
during the fourth quarter of  this business experienced a turnaround with strong demand and favorable material costs 
the company s engineered products business experienced an operating loss of million for fiscal included in this loss was the non recurring restructuring charge of million described above 
operating income for excluding this restructuring charge was million  a decrease of million or from this decline is largely a result of operating losses experienced at piper impact 
while piper impact europe made a solid contribution in its first full year with the company  slack demand in asia and the general motors strike adversely affected sales for piper impact products in north american markets 
the fabricated products lines within this business showed modest improvement over fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal by million  or  compared to fiscal this increase is largely a result of the inclusion of a full year of piper impact europe  which was not included in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increased depreciation resulted from the inclusion of piper impact europe in and the increased depreciation at piper impact for the steel products plant partially offset by lower depreciation at the engineered steel bar business 
interest expense and capitalized interest interest expense decreased by million compared to fiscal as a result of reducing bank borrowings with proceeds received from the sale of lasalle and the tubing operations 
capitalized interest increased by thousand in compared to primarily due to phase iii and iv of the macsteel expansion projects 
other other  net consists largely of investment income and remained relatively constant 
income from continuing operations the company had a loss from continuing operations of million in included in this loss was the after tax non recurring restructuring charge of million 
income from continuing operations excluding the restructuring charge was million  an improvement of million  or  compared to fiscal the improvement was attributable to improved results in the company s engineered steel bars and aluminum mill sheet businesses  and the inclusion of a full year of piper impact europe and lower interest expense 
these improvements were partially offset by lower operating results at piper impact 
the company s effective income tax rate was for fiscal and income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for fiscal  was million  which consisted of the tubing operations and lasalle steel 
there was no income from discontinued operations in fiscal see note to the financial statements net income fiscal net income was million  compared to million for fiscal included in net income for fiscal is an after tax non recurring restructuring charge of million and an after tax gain of million on the sale of discontinued operations 
included in net income for was an after tax gain of million on the sale of discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources total capitalization at october  was million  consisting of million of debt and million of equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio at the end of fiscal was compared with at the end of fiscal the lower debt to capitalization ratio results primarily from the purchase of subordinated debentures 
the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under an unsecured million revolving credit and term loan agreement bank agreement 
the bank agreement currently consists of a revolving line of credit revolver 
in july  the term loan provisions of the bank agreement expired

the most significant project included in this total relates to the company s continued expansions at macsteel 
the company plans to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and  if necessary  additional borrowings 
on december   the company announced that its board of directors approved a program to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
under terms of the program  the company may periodically purchase up to a total of million shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase plan does not have a time limit  and funds for the program will be provided from the company s available working capital and bank credit line 
the company believes that it has sufficient funds and adequate financial sources available to meet its anticipated liquidity needs 
the company also believes that cash flow from operations  cash balances and available borrowings will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to finance anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  environmental expenditures and dividends 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million 
this represents an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal this increase primarily resulted from increased cash from improved operating earnings in fiscal as compared to and a decreased use of cash for working capital 
investment activities net cash used by investment activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal fiscal cash from investing activities included the acquisition of decatur aluminum corp 
and proceeds from the sale of the tubing operations

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
which defers the effective date of sfas no 
until the company s year ending october  the company will be analyzing sfas no 
to determine what  if any  impact or additional disclosure requirements this pronouncement will have 
year the company  like other businesses  faced the year issue  also known as yk issue 
many computer systems and equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits to represent the calendar year 
this could result in computational or operational errors as dates are compared across the century boundary causing possible disruptions in business operations 
the yk issue could have occurred at any point in the company s supply  manufacturing  processing  distribution  and financial chains 
the company began addressing the yk issue in  with an initial assessment of yk readiness efforts at each of its operating units 
based on responses from the operating units  a standardized year plan format was developed 
by july  each operating unit had developed a year plan that included a inventory  b assessment  c remediation and replacement  d testing  and e third party relationships 
the year issue was addressed within the company by its individual business units  and progress was reported periodically to management 
the company committed necessary resources to conduct risk assessment and to take corrective actions  where required 
by the end of november  the company had assessed  replaced or remediated  and tested all the critical and non critical business information systems 
also  all of the non information technology non it systems were assessed  tested or vendor certified  and replaced  where necessary 
the company s business units surveyed approximately major suppliers and major customers for their year readiness efforts 
monitoring risk in this area continued through the fourth quarter of calendar contingency plans were developed to mitigate possible disruption in business operations that may result from the year issue 
these plans included carrying necessary materials and parts inventories  securing alternative sources of supply  adjusting of facility shutdown and start up schedules  development of manual procedures to execute transactions and complete processes 
once developed  these contingency plans were continually refined  as additional information became available 
the company commissioned third party reviews of its yk program  assessed the progress and identified areas where additional resources were needed 
as a result of these reviews  the company augmented the staff resources working on the yk program to address the requirements that were identified 
the company also retained a consultant to provide yk program coordination support for the corporate office  and to assist in the audit of readiness efforts at the business segments 
year activities and associated costs were managed within each business unit 
the historical costs of remediation  replacement  testing and other activities directly connected with year issues incurred through the successful completion of the project were less than million 
although the company believes that it successfully avoided any significant disruption from the year issue relating to the century rollover  it will continue to monitor all critical systems for the appearance of delayed complications or disruptions  problems relating to the leap year and problems encountered through suppliers  customers and other third parties with whom quanex deals 
although these and other unanticipated year issues could have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company  it is not possible to anticipate the extent of impact at this time 
european monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  the new currency is in response to the emu s policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy  eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital  goods and services among the participating countries 
on january   the participating countries adopted the euro as their local currency  initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash banking transactions 
the existing local currencies  or legacy currencies  will remain legal tender through january  beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for cash transactions 
for a period of six months from this date  both legacy currencies and the euro will be legal tender 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currency and use exclusively the euro 
at the current time  the company does not believe that the conversion to the euro will have a material impact on its business or its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure the following discussion of the company and its subsidiaries exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and metal commodity prices as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
for a description of the company s significant accounting policies associated with these activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries have a revolving credit facility  convertible subordinated debentures  interest rate swap agreements and other long term debt which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at october  and  the company had fixed rate debt totaling and million respectively 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the conversion feature of the company s subordinated debentures makes it impractical to estimate the effect of a hypothetical change in interest rates 
this is due to the high correlation between the market value of these instruments and the market value of the company s common stock 
in general  any changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries floating rate obligations total million at october  and see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the exposure of these obligations to increases in short term interest rates is limited by interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company 
these swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on all of the company s variable rate debt  thus limiting the potential impact that increasing interest rates would have on earnings 
under these swap agreements  payments are made based on a fixed rate million at  and million at and received on a libor based variable rate and at october  and  respectively 
at october  and  the unrealized losses related to the interest rate swap agreements are and million 
if the floating rates were to change by from october levels  the fair market value of these swaps would change by approximately and million as of october  and  respectively 
however  it should be noted that any change in value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company is subject to significant exposure from fluctuations in us dollar dutch guilder exchange rates 
as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to limit transactional exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
at october  the company had no such contracts open as the transactional exposure was immaterial 
as of october   the company had separate contracts maturing in monthly increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency 
these forward contracts did not extend beyond september  unrealized pretax gains on these forward contracts totaled approximately thousand at october  a hypothetical change in applicable october  forward rates would increase or decrease the pretax gain by approximately thousand related to these positions 
however  it should be noted that any change in value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
in addition  the company utilizes a range forward zero cost agreement to protect its initial equity investment in its netherlands subsidiary  piper impact europe 
this agreement  which was entered into with a major financial institution  has a notional value of million guilders 
by establishing minimum and maximum exchange rates  this agreement limits the potential devaluation of the company s initial investment in its subsidiary while also limiting any potential appreciation 
if  at the expiration date of the agreement  the dutch guilder us dollar exchange rate is within the range of to  this agreement will expire at no cost to either party 
at october   there was no financial statement impact as the exchange rate fell within the range 
at october   the company booked a gain to stockholder s equity of thousand 
a hypothetical increase in the october  and exchange rate would result in a positive adjustment to stockholders equity of approximately million and thousand  respectively 
in contrast  a hypothetical decrease would result in a negative adjustment to stockholder s equity of approximately thousand and million  respectively 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of this agreement  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged position 
commodity price risk in the normal course of business  the company enters into long term firm price aluminum sheet sales contracts 
in order to hedge the risk of higher prices for the anticipated aluminum purchases required to fulfill these long term contracts  the company enters into long futures positions 
at october  and  the company had open futures contracts at fair values of and million  respectively  and an unrealized gain of thousand and an unrealized loss of thousand  respectively  on such contracts 
these contracts covered a notional volume of  and  pounds of aluminum 
a hypothetical change from the october  and average london metal exchange lme ingot price of 
and  respectively  per pound would increase or decrease the unrealized pretax losses related to these contracts by approximately and thousand  respectively 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the cost of purchased aluminum scrap
