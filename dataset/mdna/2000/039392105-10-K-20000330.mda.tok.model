these statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of when used herein  words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend and similar expressions  as they relate to arch or its management  identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of arch with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including but not limited to those factors set forth below under the caption factors affecting future operating results 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated  believed  estimated  expected or intended 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their respective dates 
arch undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
all subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to arch or persons acting on behalf of arch are expressly qualified in their entirety by the discussion under factors affecting future operating results 
overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with arch s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
arch derives the majority of its revenues from fixed monthly or other periodic fees charged to subscribers for wireless communication services 
such fees are not generally dependant on usage 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed periodic fees without incurrence of additional selling expenses by arch 
arch s service  rental and maintenance revenues and the related expenses exhibit substantially similar growth trends 
arch s average revenue per subscriber has declined over the last three years for three principal reasons o an increase in the number of reseller customers whose airtime is purchased at wholesale rates  o an increase in the number of subscriber owned and reseller owned units for which arch receives no recurring equipment revenue  and o an increase in competition in certain of the markets in which arch operates 
the reduction in average revenue per subscriber resulting from these trends has been more than offset by the reduction of expenses so that arch s margins had been improving until the consummation of the mobilemedia merger which resulted in redundant management and administrative headcount 
arch expects the margins to improve as the integration of the two companies eliminates these redundant expenses 
arch has achieved significant growth in units in service and adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda through acquisitions and  prior to  internal growth 
during  units in service decreased by thousand units  excluding the addition of subscribers from the mobilemedia acquisition 
from january  through december   arch s total number of units in service grew from million to million units 
arch s total revenues have increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  and to million in the year ended december  arch had net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  as a result of significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired and developed assets and interest charges associated with indebtedness 
as its subscriber base has grown  arch s adjusted ebitda has increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  and to million in the year ended december  ebitda is a commonly used measure of financial performance in the wireless communications industry 
adjusted ebitda is also one of the financial measures used to calculate whether arch and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the covenants under their respective debt agreements 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap 
one of arch s financial objectives is to increase its adjusted ebitda  since this is a significant source of funds for servicing indebtedness and for investment in continued growth  including purchase of messaging units and messaging system equipment  construction and expansion of messaging systems  and possible acquisitions 
adjusted ebitda  as determined by arch  may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled data of other wireless communications companies 
amounts reflected as adjusted ebitda are not necessarily available for discretionary use as a result of restrictions imposed by the terms of existing or future indebtedness  including the repayment of such indebtedness or the payment of associated interest  limitations imposed by applicable law upon the payment of dividends or distributions or capital expenditure requirements 
pending pagenet merger in november  arch signed a definitive agreement with paging network  inc pagenet pursuant to which pagenet will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of arch 
each outstanding share of pagenet common stock will be converted into share of arch common stock in the merger 
under the merger agreement  pagenet is required to make an exchange offer of pagenet common stock to holders of its outstanding senior subordinated notes due  its senior subordinated notes due and its senior subordinated notes due collectively  the pagenet notes  having an aggregate outstanding principal amount of billion 
under the pagenet exchange offer  an aggregate of  shares of pagenet common stock  together with of the equity interest in pagenet s subsidiary  vast solutions  would be exchanged for all of the pagenet notes  in the aggregate 
in connection with the merger  pagenet would distribute to its stockholders other than holders who received shares in the pagenet exchange offer  of the equity interests in vast solutions 
after the merger  the combined company would retain a equity interest in vast solutions 
under the merger agreement arch is required to make an exchange offer of up to  shares of its common stock in the aggregate for all of its senior discount notes due as of march   arch has issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for million maturity value of its senior discount notes 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of funds 
if the pagenet exchange offer and the arch exchange offer were fully subscribed  immediately following the merger and the issuance of arch common stock in exchange for pagenet common stock  in the arch exchange offer  current holders of arch common stock would own approximately of the outstanding arch common stock  current holders of the arch senior discount notes would own approximately of the outstanding arch common stock  current holders of pagenet common stock would own approximately of the outstanding arch common stock and current holders of the pagenet notes in the aggregate would own approximately of the outstanding arch common stock 
in addition  following the merger arch would have  on a pro forma basis  total debt of approximately billion 
under the merger agreement  the arch board of directors at the closing would consist of individuals  at least six of whom would be designated by the existing arch board of directors 
the pagenet board of directors would designate three members  and the three largest holders of pagenet notes would each be entitled to designate one member 
to the extent any such holder of pagenet notes did not elect to designate a director  the number of directors designated by the arch board of directors would increase 
arch expects the merger  which has been approved by the boards of directors of arch and pagenet  but is subject to regulatory review  shareholder approval  other third party consents and the completion of the exchange offers  to be completed in the second or third quarter of each of the pagenet exchange offer and the arch exchange offer is conditioned upon acceptance by the holders of of the pagenet notes and the arch senior discount notes  respectively subject to reduction in specified circumstances 
under the merger agreement  pagenet is required to include a prepackaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the materials relating to the pagenet exchange offer  and to solicit consents for this prepackaged plan from holders of the pagenet notes and its senior creditors 
in certain circumstances pagenet has agreed either to file the prepackaged plan in lieu of completing the pagenet exchange offer or to pay arch a termination fee 
the agreement provides that each party may be obligated to pay the other a termination fee equal to million under the terms described under note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
potential effects of the pagenet merger if arch acquires pagenet on the terms described above  the combined company will have substantially larger assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on a pro forma basis at december   the combined company would have had approximately million units in service  total assets of billion and total long term debt of billion  assuming that all of the outstanding discount notes are exchanged for common stock 
the pagenet merger is subject to regulatory approvals  stockholder and noteholder consents and many other conditions and  in consequence  it may not take place 
if arch does not acquire pagenet  the contemplated benefits of the merger will not be realized  despite the incurrence of substantial transaction costs  which are estimated at million each for arch and pagenet 
if the merger does not take place after one company pursues an alternative offer and either company decides to terminate the merger agreement  one company may be required to pay the other a million termination fee 
mobilemedia merger in june  arch acquired mobilemedia communications  inc  which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of arch 
mobilemedia had been operating as a debtor in possession under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
arch acquired mobilemedia for a combination of cash and arch securities  as follows o arch paid approximately million in cash to secured creditors of mobilemedia  o arch paid a total of million to pay fees  expenses and other debts  o arch issued  shares of its common stock to unsecured creditors of mobilemedia  o arch issued and sold  additional shares of its common stock to unsecured creditors of mobilemedia and arch stockholders for a total purchase price of million  and o arch issued to four unsecured creditors  who had agreed to act as standby purchasers and to purchase shares not purchased by other unsecured creditors  warrants to acquire  shares of its common stock on or before september  for per share 
arch also issued to the holders of its common stock and series c preferred stock on january  non transferable rights to acquire up to  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
a total of  non transferable rights were exercised 
because non transferable rights to acquire  shares were not exercised  arch issued in their place warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock for per share 
subsidiaries of arch also borrowed a total of million to help fund the mobilemedia acquisition 
during the third quarter of  arch s board of directors approved plans covering the elimination of redundant headcount and facilities in connection with the overall integration of operations 
it is expected that integration will be completed by december  because arch anticipates a net reduction of approximately of mobilemedia s workforce and the closing of some facilities and tower sites  it established a million acquisition reserve which is included as part of the purchase price of mobilemedia 
the initial acquisition reserve consisted of approximately o million for employee severance  o million for lease obligations and terminations  and o million of other costs 
there can be no assurance that the desired cost savings will be achieved or that the integration of the two companies will be accomplished smoothly  expeditiously or successfully 
see note to the notes to arch s consolidated financial statements

revenues were also adversely affected in the fourth quarter of and in by o arch s decision  in anticipation of the mobilemedia acquisition  not to replace normal attrition among direct sales personnel  o the reduced effectiveness of arch s reseller channels of distribution  and o reduced sales through arch operated retail stores 
arch expects revenue to continue to be adversely affected in by declining demand for basic numeric and alphanumeric paging services 
arch believes that the basic paging industry did not grow during  that demand for basic paging services will decline in and the following years and that any significant future growth in the paging industry will be attributable to advanced messaging services  such as send and receive and guaranteed receipt paging services 
see industry overview 
as a result  arch believes that it will experience a net decline in the number of its units in service in  excluding the addition of subscribers from the pagenet acquisition  as arch s addition of advanced messaging subscribers is exceeded by its loss of basic paging subscribers 
service  rental and maintenance revenues  which consist primarily of recurring revenues associated with the sale or lease of units  increased to million  a increase  in from million in these increases in revenues were due primarily to the net increase in the number of units in service from million at december  to million at december  this net increase in units was due to the acquisition of mobilemedia on june   offset by a net decrease of  units in service

service  rental and maintenance expenses  which consist primarily of telephone  third party carrier fees and site rental expenses  increased to million  of net revenues  in from million  of net revenues  in the increase was due primarily to increased expenses associated with the provision of wireless communications services to a greater number of units due to the mobilemedia acquisition 
annualized service  rental and maintenance expenses per unit increased to in from in this increase was due primarily to the increase in wireless messaging systems and associated expenses as a result of the mobilemedia merger 
however  the per unit costs should decrease in the future if expected synergies are achieved and as existing systems become more populated through the addition of new units and the fixed costs of operating these systems are spread over a larger unit base 
selling expenses increased to million  of net revenues  in from million  of net revenues  in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased headcount and the increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to redundant headcount as a result of the mobilemedia merger

in october  arch recognized an extraordinary gain of million on the retirement of debt exchanged for arch common stock 
in june  arch recognized an extraordinary charge of million representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of indebtedness under prior credit facilities 
on january   arch adopted the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 
sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
initial application of sop resulted in a million charge which was reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this charge represents the unamortized portion of start up and organization costs which had been deferred in prior years 
net loss increased to million in from million in  as a result of the factors outlined above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  total revenues increased to million  a increase  in  from million in as the number of units in service increased from million at december  to million at december  net revenues increased to million  a increase in from million in total revenues and net revenues in were adversely affected by a general slowing of industry growth  compared to prior years 
revenues were also adversely affected in the fourth quarter of by o arch s decision  in anticipation of the mobilemedia acquisition  not to replace normal attrition among direct sales personnel  o the reduced effectiveness of arch s reseller channels of distribution  and o reduced sales through arch operated retail stores 
service  rental and maintenance revenues  increased to million  a increase  in from million in these increases in revenues were due primarily to the increase  through internal growth  in the number of units in service from million at december  to million at december  maintenance revenues represented less than of total service  rental and maintenance revenues in and product sales  less cost of products sold  decreased to million  a decrease  in from million in  respectively  as a result of a decline in the average revenue per unit sold 
service  rental and maintenance expenses  increased to million  of net revenues  in from million  of net revenues  in the increase was due primarily to increased expenses associated with system expansions and an increase in the number of units in service 
annualized service  rental and maintenance expenses per subscriber were in compared to in selling expenses decreased to million  of net revenues  in from million  of net revenues  in the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of net new units in service and to nonrecurring marketing costs incurred in to promote arch s new arch paging brand identity 
the number of net new units in service resulting from internal growth decreased by in compared to primarily due to the factors set forth above that adversely affected revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  of net revenues  in  from million  of net revenues  in the increase was due primarily to administrative and facility costs associated with supporting more units in service 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to million in from million in these expenses principally reflected arch s acquisitions in prior periods accounted for as purchases 
they also reflected investment in units and other system expansion equipment to support growth 
operating losses were million in compared to million in  as a result of the factors outlined above 
net interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was principally attributable to an increase in arch s outstanding debt 
interest expense for included approximately million of interest which accretes on arch s senior discount notes even though the cash payment of the interest is deferred 
interest expense for included approximately million of accretion on these notes 
arch recognized an income tax benefit of million in this benefit represented the tax benefit of operating losses incurred subsequent to the acquisitions of usa mobile and westlink which were available to offset deferred tax liabilities arising from those acquisitions 
the tax benefit of these operating losses was fully recognized during accordingly  arch has established a valuation reserve against its deferred tax assets which reduced the income tax benefit to zero as of december  arch does not expect to recover its deferred tax asset in the foreseeable future and will continue to increase its valuation reserve accordingly 
see note to arch s consolidated financial statements 
in june  arch recognized an extraordinary charge of million representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of indebtedness under prior credit facilities 
net loss increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   as a result of the factors outlined above 
liquidity and capital resources arch s business strategy requires the availability of substantial funds to finance the expansion of existing operations  to fund capital expenditures for subscriber equipment and network system equipment  to service debt and to finance acquisitions 
arch s net cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the periods indicated in the table below are as follows year ended december  dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities investing activities in included million for the acquisition of mobilemedia 
financing activities in included million from the sale of common stock to unsecured creditors of mobilemedia and borrowings of million in connection with the acquisition of mobilemedia as described above 
capital expenditures and commitments excluding acquisitions of wireless messaging businesses  arch s capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in to date  arch generally has funded its capital expenditures with net cash provided by operating activities and the incurrence of debt 
arch s capital expenditures primarily involved the purchase of wireless messaging units  system and transmission equipment  information systems and capitalized financing costs 
arch estimates the amount of capital that will be required to fund capital expenditures for will be approximately million million on a pro forma basis if the pagenet merger were consummated on january  
such expenditures will be used primarily for subscriber equipment  network infrastructure  information systems and the construction of certain markets for the nationwide network of narrowband personal communications services 
however  the actual amount of capital to be required by the combined company will depend on a number of factors 
these include subscriber growth  the type of products and services demanded by customers  service revenues  the nature and timing of arch s strategy to deploy its narrowband personal communications services network  and acquisition strategies and opportunities 
arch believes that it will have sufficient cash available from operations and credit facilities to fund its capital expenditures for other commitments and contingencies through arch s may acquisition of westlink  arch acquired a equity interest in benbow pcs ventures  inc benbow holds exclusive rights to a khz outbound khz inbound narrowband personal communications services license in each of the five regions of the united states 
arch was formerly obligated to advance benbow sufficient funds to service debt obligations incurred by benbow in connection with its acquisition of its narrowband personal communications services licenses and to finance construction of a narrowband personal communications services system unless funds were available to benbow from other sources 
arch estimates that this obligation totaled approximately million at march  this obligation was subject to the approval of arch s designee on benbow s board of directors 
as of march  arch had advanced approximately million to benbow 
in june  arch  benbow and benbow s controlling stockholder agreed that o the shareholders agreement  the management agreement and the employment agreement governing the establishment and operation of benbow will be terminated  o benbow will not make any further federal communications commission payments and will not pursue construction of an narrowband personal communications services system  o arch will not be obligated to fund federal communications commission payments or construction of a narrowband personal communications services system by benbow  and o the closing of the transaction will occur on the earlier of january  or receipt of federal communications commission approval 
on december   benbow filed with the federal communications commission a proposal for debt forgiveness which  if approved  would result in surrender by benbow of its five narrowband personal communications services licenses back to the government  and forgiveness by the government of the remaining debt owed on the surrendered licenses and waiver of any applicable default payments 
a total of approximately million in principal debt to the government remains payable by benbow on the five narrowband personal communications services licenses 
benbow s debt forgiveness proposal is pending and arch can not determine whether the federal communications commission ultimately will approve it 
in its debt forgiveness proposal  however  benbow demonstrated that the proposal meets standards for debt forgiveness under applicable federal law 
the june agreement between arch  benbow and benbow s controlling shareholder provides  regardless of the outcome of the debt forgiveness proposal  that arch will fulfill all of its current financial obligations to benbow  arch is released from any further obligations to provide funding to benbow  and benbow s controlling shareholder will be paid for her benbow stock consistent with the preexisting agreement with arch which requires arch to pay the controlling stockholder in benbow  in installments  an aggregate amount of million if the transaction closes before january  or million if the transaction closes on january  
in addition to the narrowband personal communications services licenses  benbow holds conventional paging licenses which would be transferred to arch upon federal communications commission approval 
as a result of these arrangements  benbow will not have any meaningful business operations and is unlikely to retain its narrowband personal communications services licenses 
the closing of the transaction will not affect the funding obligations of arch in connection with benbow s acquisition of pagecall in june described below 
on june   benbow acquired all of the outstanding stock of page call by issuing to page call s former stockholders preferred stock and a promissory note for million 
benbow also agreed to pay one of page call s stockholders  over five years for consulting services 
benbow s preferred stock and promissory note  which will total million upon maturity at april   are exchangeable for arch common stock o at any time at the holders option  at an exchange price equal to the higher of per share or the market price of arch common stock  o mandatorily on april   at the then prevailing market price of common stock  or o automatically at an exchange price of per share  if the market price of arch common stock equals or exceeds for consecutive trading days 
arch is permitted to require benbow to redeem its preferred stock and promissory note at any time for cash 
arch guaranteed all obligations of benbow under the benbow preferred stock  promissory note and consulting agreement described above 
arch may elect to make payments under its guarantee in common stock or cash 
benbow s redemption of its preferred stock and promissory note for cash  or arch s payment of cash pursuant to its guarantees of benbow s preferred stock and promissory note  would depend upon the availability of capital and any restrictions contained in applicable debt instruments and under the delaware corporations statute  which currently would not permit any such cash redemptions or payments 
if arch issues common stock or pays cash pursuant to its guarantees  arch will receive from benbow a promissory note and non voting  non convertible preferred stock of benbow with an annual yield of payable upon an acquisition of benbow or earlier to the extent that available cash and applicable law permit 
page call s former stockholders received customary registration rights for any shares of common stock issued in exchange for benbow s preferred stock and promissory note or pursuant to arch s guarantees 
since it is unlikely that benbow will be able to meet these obligations and arch is currently required to settle the obligation in stock  arch has recorded the issuance of million of its common stock in additional paid in capital and as a charge to operations  to satisfy the obligation in april interest payments commence september  on the million principal amount at maturity of arch s senior discount notes outstanding as of march  unless all of the senior discount notes are tendered in the exchange offer  arch expects to service such interest payments out of cash made available to it by its subsidiaries 
based on the principal amount outstanding at march  and assuming that no notes are tendered  such interest payments will equal a maximum of million on march and september of each year until scheduled maturity on march  if the pagenet merger agreement is terminated after arch pursues an alternative offer  arch may be required to pay a termination fee of million 
sources of funds arch believes that its capital needs for the foreseeable future will be funded with borrowings under current and future credit facilities  net cash provided by operations and  depending on arch s needs and market conditions  possible sales of equity or debt securities 
for additional information  see note to arch s consolidated financial statements 
arch s ability to borrow in the future will depend  in part  on its ability to continue to increase its adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
recent issuance of notes in june  a subsidiary or arch issued million principal amount of senior notes due in a private placement pursuant to rule a under the securities act 
the notes were sold at of the face amount for net proceeds of million 
credit facility an arch subsidiary has a senior credit facility that currently permits it to borrow up to million consisting of i a million reducing revolving tranche a facility  ii a million tranche b term loan and iii a million tranche c term loan 
the tranche a facility will be reduced on a quarterly basis commencing on september  and will mature on june  the tranche b term loan will be amortized in quarterly installments commencing september   with an ultimate maturity date of june  the tranche c term loan began amortizing in annual installments on december   with an ultimate maturity date of june  on march   the senior credit facility was amended to add a million tranche b term loan to be used to repay obligations under pagenet s existing credit facility upon completion of the pending pagenet merger 
the tranche b term loan will be amortized in quarterly installments commencing march   with an ultimate maturity date of june  equity issued in exchange for debt in october  arch issued  shares of arch common stock  which had a weighted average closing price of per share as of the dates of the transactions  and warrants to purchase  shares of arch common stock for per share in exchange for million principal amount of arch convertible debentures 
arch also issued  shares of arch common stock  which had a weighted average closing price of per share as of the dates of the transactions  in exchange for million accreted value million maturity value of its senior discount notes 
in february and march  arch issued  shares of arch common stock  which had a closing price of per share as of the date of the transaction  in exchange for million principal amount of arch convertible debentures 
arch also issued  shares of arch common stock  which had a weighted average closing price of per share as of the dates of the transactions  in exchange for million accreted value million maturity value of its senior discount notes 
following these transactions  on march   arch had million principal amount of the convertible debentures and million accreted value million maturity value of senior discount notes outstanding 
on march   arch announced it had entered into an agreement with resurgence asset management llc for the exchange of million accreted value million maturity value of senior discount notes held by various resurgence entities for a new class of arch s preferred stock to be called series d preferred stock 
the series d preferred stock will o be convertible at the holder s option at any time into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of shares of common stock per  maturity value  o be subject to mandatory conversion into an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon completion of arch s pending merger with pagenet  o if not earlier converted  commencing march   bear semi annual dividends at the rate of per annum  payable at arch s option in cash or through the issuance of a new class of arch s preferred stock to be called series e preferred stock  o be subject to mandatory redemption on march  if redemption is then permitted by applicable law  o vote with the common stock on an as converted basis  and o rank upon liquidation senior to the common stock and on a parity with arch s existing series c preferred stock 
if arch issues series e preferred stock as a dividend on the series d preferred stock  the series e preferred stock will be identical to the series d preferred stock except that it will not be subject to conversion into common stock  have any voting rights as required by law or bear dividends 
completion of the resurgence exchange transactions is subject to o the sale by resurgence to a third party to be selected by resurgence of million accreted value million maturity value of senior discount notes and the third party s exchange of the notes for  shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of shares of common stock per  of maturity value  o receipt of arch stockholder approval of a proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from  to  which approval will be sought at a special meeting of stockholder scheduled to be held on april   o filing of amendments to arch s certificate of incorporation to reflect the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock and create the series d preferred stock and series e preferred stock  o receipt of all required regulatory and lender approvals  and o completion of the transactions by april  inflation inflation has not had a material effect on arch s operations to date 
systems equipment and operating costs have not increased in price and wireless messaging units have tended to decline in recent years 
this reduction in costs has generally been reflected in lower prices charged to subscribers who purchase their wireless messaging units 
arch s general operating expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
factors affecting future operating results continued losses are likely arch has reported net losses in the past  as has mobilemedia 
arch expects that it will continue to report net losses and cannot give any assurance about when  if ever  it is likely to attain profitability 
arch has reported net losses in all of the periods shown in the table below year ended december  dollars in millions net income loss arch mobilemedia through arch s acquisition of mobilemedia on june  these historical net losses have resulted principally from substantial depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to intangible assets and messaging device depreciation  interest expense  the impairment of long lived assets  other costs of growth 
mobilemedia had net income of million during the year ended december  solely because of a million gain on the sale of transmission towers and related equipment and net income of million for the period ended june  due to the forgiveness of debt arising out of mobilemedia s bankruptcy proceedings 
after giving effect to the mobilemedia acquisition  arch would have incurred  on a pro forma basis  losses before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting change of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  declines in units in service are likely cancellation of units in service can significantly affect the results of operations of wireless communications service providers 
the sales and marketing costs associated with attracting new subscribers are substantial compared to the costs of providing service to existing customers 
because the wireless communications business is characterized by high fixed costs  cancellations directly and adversely affect earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in  arch experienced a decrease of  units in service  excluding the addition of subscribers from the mobilemedia acquisition 
arch believes that the basic paging industry did not grow during  that demand for basic paging services will decline in and the following years and that any significant future growth in the paging industry will be attributable to advanced messaging services  such as send and receive and guaranteed receipt paging services 
as a result  arch believes that it will experience a net decline in the number of its units in service in  excluding the addition of subscribers from the pagenet acquisition  as arch s addition of advanced messaging subscribers is exceeded by its loss of basic paging subscribers 
revenues and operating results may fluctuate  leading to fluctuations in trading prices and possible liquidity problems arch believes that future fluctuations in its revenues and operating results may occur due to many factors 
arch s current and planned expenses and debt repayment levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term  and are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and cash flow growth 
arch may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue or cash flow shortfall 
it is possible that  due to future fluctuations  arch s revenue  cash flow or operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
this may have a material adverse effect on the price of arch s common stock 
if shortfalls were to cause arch not to meet the financial covenants contained in its debt instruments  the debtholders could declare a default and seek immediate repayment 
in the worst case  if arch lacked funds to repay its debt  it could file for bankruptcy protection 
high degree of leverage may continue to burden operations arch has been highly leveraged  and will remain substantially leveraged following the pagenet merger 
the following table compares the total debt  total assets and latest three month annualized adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of arch at or as of december  dollars in millions total debt  total assets  annualized adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is not a measure defined in gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda  as determined by arch  may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled data of other wireless messaging companies 
substantial leverage may have the following adverse consequences for arch o this leverage may impair arch s ability to obtain additional financing necessary for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes on acceptable terms  if at all 
o a substantial portion of arch s cash flow will be required to pay interest expense  this will reduce the funds which would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities 
o arch s credit facilities and indentures contain financial and restrictive covenants  the failure to comply with these covenants may result in an event of default which could have a material adverse effect on arch if not cured or waived 
o arch may be more highly leveraged than some of its competitors in the wireless communications industry  and this may place it at a competitive disadvantage 
o any degree of leverage will make arch more vulnerable to a downturn in its business or the economy generally than if it were not as leveraged 
arch may not be able to reduce its financial leverage as it intends  and may not be able to achieve an appropriate balance between growth which it considers acceptable and future reductions in financial leverage 
if arch is not able to achieve continued growth in adjusted ebitda  it may be precluded from incurring additional indebtedness due to cash flow coverage requirements under existing or future debt instruments 
growth and acquisition strategy arch believes that the wireless communications industry has experienced  and will continue to experience  consolidation due to factors that favor larger  multi market companies  including o the ability to obtain additional radio spectrum  o greater access to capital markets and lower costs of capital  o broader geographic coverage of wireless messaging systems  o economies of scale in the purchase of capital equipment  o operating efficiencies  and o enhanced access to executive personnel 
arch has pursued  and intends to continue to pursue  acquisitions of wireless communications businesses as a key component of its growth strategy 
however  the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of arch s management 
no assurance can be given that suitable acquisitions can be identified  financed and completed on acceptable terms  or that any future acquisitions by arch will be successful 
implementation of arch s growth strategy will be subject to numerous other contingencies beyond the control of its management 
these contingencies include national and regional economic conditions  interest rates  competition  changes in regulation or technology and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that arch s growth strategy will prove effective or that its goals will be achieved

amortization charges from the pagenet merger and the earlier mobilemedia acquisition may reduce arch s earnings sooner than management expects under purchase accounting treatment for the pending pagenet merger and the acquisition of mobilemedia communications  inc in june  arch must record a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
this will result in substantial amortization charges to the consolidated income of arch over the useful lives of those assets 
arch estimates the amount of those charges will total approximately million per year for ten years 
however  actual charges in the early years could adversely affect reported results of operations more than is currently anticipated if the underlying assets are impaired or if the useful lives of the assets are less than currently estimated 
the pagenet merger may not take place 
if it does not take place  arch will incur substantial costs and its investors will not enjoy the anticipated benefits of the merger the pagenet merger will not take place unless many conditions are satisfied or waived 
these conditions include stockholder and noteholder approvals  governmental approvals and the availability of senior credit facilities 
if the pagenet merger does not take place  the contemplated benefits of the merger will not be realized  and arch will not enjoy the anticipated benefits of the merger despite incurring substantial transaction costs 
if the pagenet merger agreement is terminated after arch pursues an alternative offer  arch may be required to pay a termination fee of million 
arch may need additional capital to expand its business which could be difficult to obtain arch s business strategy requires substantial funds to be available to finance the continued development and future growth and expansion of its operations  including possible acquisitions 
arch s future capital requirements will depend on factors that include o subscriber growth  o the type of wireless communications devices and services demanded by customers  o technological developments  o marketing and sales expenses  o competitive conditions  o the nature and timing of arch s narrowband personal communications service strategy  and o acquisition strategies and opportunities 
arch cannot be certain that additional equity or debt financing will be available to arch when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient financing is unavailable when needed  arch may be unable to develop or enhance its products  take advantage of future opportunities  grow its business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated needs 
competition and technological change may undermine arch s market position and adversely affect its results of operations arch may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors in the wireless communications business or with competitors offering alternative communication technologies 
in particular competition may intensify from large companies and may reduce arch s revenues and operating margins arch may face significant additional competition in the future 
this could have a material adverse effect on its revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
some competitors possess greater financial  technical and other resources than those of arch 
increased competition from broadband personal communications service providers  cellular providers  digital specialized mobile radio providers  dedicated data networks and wireless information delivery service providers has led to competition from increasingly larger and better capitalized competitors 
in addition  arch competes with the many other providers of paging and advanced messaging services 
if any of such competitors were to devote additional resources to the wireless communications business or focus on arch s historical business segments  they could secure arch s customers and reduce demand for its products 
this could materially reduce arch s revenue and operating margins 
new send and receive wireless messaging technology may adversely affect arch s competitive position competitors are currently using and developing a variety of send and receive wireless messaging technologies 
arch currently resells such send and receive services over the network of a competitor 
due to the relatively recent availability of send and receive messaging products and services  there have not yet been sales which would be sufficient to fully indicate a proven demand for such services among business or consumer subscribers 
such services will compete with other available methods of telecommunications  including cellular and broadband personal communications services  which are commonly referred to as pcs  as well as specialized mobile radio  services and services provided over dedicated data networks which use hand held devices to send and receive data 
although these services are primarily focused on send and receive voice communications  they may include wireless messaging as an adjunct service or may replace the need for send and receive messaging entirely 
it is less expensive for an end user to obtain a cellular or pcs unit with data capability than the send and receive messaging units currently available 
this is because the nationwide cellular and pcs carriers have subsidized the purchase of these units and because prices for broadband services have been declining rapidly  making the two types of services and product offerings more comparable 
future technological advances in the telecommunications industry  including these send and receive messaging technologies  as well as wireless information and machine to machine and machine to person messaging  among others  could increase the number and type of new services or products which compete with the wireless messaging services historically offered by arch 
firms seeking to provide wireless communications through these and other technologies may bring their products to market faster or in packages of products that consumers find more valuable than those which arch proposes to provide 
all of these factors could reduce arch s market share and adversely affect its revenues and operating margins 
obsolescence in company owned units may impose additional costs on arch technological change may also adversely affect the value of the units owned by arch that are leased to its subscribers 
if arch s current subscribers request more technologically advanced units  including send and receive units  arch could incur additional inventory costs and capital expenditures if required to replace units leased to its subscribers within a short period of time 
such additional costs or capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on arch s results of operations 
government regulation may burden operations licenses may not be automatically renewed arch s federal communications commission paging licenses are for varying terms of up to years 
when the licenses expire  renewal applications must be approved by the federal communications commission 
to date  the federal communications commission has approved each assignment and transfer of control for which arch has sought approval but  no assurance can be given that any future renewal applications will be free of challenge or will be granted by the federal communications commission 
loss of licenses would impair arch s operations 
regulatory changes could add burdens or benefit competing technologies the federal communications commission continually reviews and revises its rules affecting wireless communications companies 
therefore  regulatory requirements that apply to arch may change significantly over time 
acquisitions of arch s stock by foreigners could jeopardize arch s licenses the communications act limits foreign investment in and ownership of radio common carriers licensed by the federal communications commission  as well as their parent companies 
arch may not have more than of its stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives  a foreign government or its representatives or a foreign corporation if the federal communications commission finds that the public interest would be served by denying such ownership 
arch s subsidiaries that are radio common carrier licensees are subject to more stringent requirements and may have only up to of their stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives  a foreign government or their representatives or a foreign corporation 
this ownership restriction is not subject to waiver 
arch s charter permits the redemption of shares of arch s capital stock from foreign stockholders where necessary to protect federal communications commission licenses held by arch or its subsidiaries  but such a redemption would be subject to the availability of capital to arch and any restrictions contained in applicable debt instruments and under the delaware corporation statute 
these restrictions currently would not permit any such redemptions 
the failure to redeem shares promptly could jeopardize the federal communications commission licenses held by arch or its subsidiaries 
because arch depends on third parties  that it does not control  for products and services  arch s operations may be disrupted arch does not manufacture any of the equipment customers need to take advantage of its services 
it is dependent primarily on motorola  inc and nec america inc to obtain sufficient equipment inventory for new subscribers and replacement needs and on glenayre electronics  inc and motorola for sufficient terminals and transmitters to meet its expansion and replacement requirements 
significant delays in obtaining equipment  terminals or transmitters  such as mobilemedia experienced before its bankruptcy filing  could lead to disruptions in operations and adverse financial consequences 
motorola has announced its intention to discontinue manufacturing transmitters and other paging infrastructure during  although it will continue to maintain and service existing infrastructure into the future 
arch s purchase agreement with motorola expires on march  there can be no assurance that the agreement with motorola will be renewed or  if renewed  that the renewed agreement will be on terms and conditions as favorable to the combined company as those under the current agreement 
arch relies on third parties to provide satellite transmission for some aspects of its wireless communications services 
to the extent there are satellite outages or if satellite coverage is impaired in other ways  arch may experience a loss of service until such time as satellite coverage is restored  which could have a material adverse effect due to customer complaints 
loss of key personnel could adversely impact operations arch s success will depend  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
arch does not have employment agreements with any of its current executive officers  or maintain life insurance on their lives  although all executive officers have entered into executive retention agreements with arch 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of its executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on arch 
charter provisions may impede takeovers of arch that might benefit arch stockholders arch s certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for o a classified board of directors  divided into three classes who are elected for three year terms  o the issuance of blank check preferred stock whose terms may be fixed by arch s board of directors without further stockholder approval  o a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent in lieu of a meeting  and o procedural requirements governing stockholder meetings 
arch also has a stockholders rights plan 
in addition  section of the delaware corporations statute will  with some exceptions  prohibit arch from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a three year period after such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  making more difficult or preventing a change in control or acquisition of arch even though a transaction like that might be beneficial to arch s stockholders 
restrictions under debt instruments may prevent arch from taking actions which its board considers beneficial various debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on arch 
arch s senior credit facility requires various arch operating subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum debt service coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the senior credit facility was amended and restated on march  to permit the pagenet merger and includes a restriction on capital expenditures and a minimum revenue test 
in addition  the senior credit facility limits or restricts  among other things  arch s operating subsidiaries ability to o declare dividends or repurchase capital stock  o incur or pay back indebtedness  o engage in mergers  consolidations  acquisitions and asset sales  or o alter its lines of business or accounting methods 
arch s ability to comply with such covenants may be affected by events beyond its control  including prevailing economic and financial conditions 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior credit facility and or other debt instruments 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the creditors could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if arch were unable to repay any such amounts  the senior creditors could proceed against any collateral securing the indebtedness 
if the lenders under the senior credit facility or other debt instruments accelerated the payment of such indebtedness  there can be no assurance that the assets of arch would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and other indebtedness of arch 
in addition  because the senior credit facility and other debt instruments limit arch s ability to engage in some types of transactions  arch may be prohibited from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to arch 
recent and pending accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings 
arch intends to adopt this standard effective january  arch has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements  however  adopting sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  on december  this sab provides additional guidance on the accounting for revenue recognition  including both broad conceptual discussions as well as certain industry specific guidance 
the guidance is effective for the second quarter of fiscal arch does not expect sab to have a material impact on its results of operations upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of arch s long term debt is subject to fixed rates of interest or interest rate protection 
in the event that the interest rate on arch s non fixed rate debt fluctuates by in either direction  arch believes the impact on its results of operations would be immaterial 
arch transacts infrequently in foreign currency and therefore is not exposed to significant foreign currency market risk
