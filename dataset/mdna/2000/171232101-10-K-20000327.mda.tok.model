item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents our past results and our expectations for the near term future 
the supplementary financial information and the consolidated financial statements and related notes  all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of our results and our financial position  are incorporated by reference from the corporation s annual report to shareholders  pages  and through certain statements in this document  as well as certain statements incorporated by reference herein  may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  such as statements that include the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by any such statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed or identified from time to time in the corporation s public filings with the securities and exchange commission and specifically to risks or uncertainties associated with the corporation s expectations with respect to premium price increases  the non renewal of underpriced insurance accounts or business retention or profitability estimates  as well as with respect to loss reserve adequacy  its investment income or cash flow projections  or its announced real estate plans  and more generally  to general economic conditions including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets  changes in domestic and foreign laws  regulations and taxes  changes in competition and pricing environments  regional or general changes in asset valuations  the occurrence of significant natural disasters  the development of major year or privacy liabilities  the inability to reinsure certain risks economically  the adequacy of loss reserves or currency conversion transactions  as well as general market conditions  competition  pricing and restructurings 
operating income  which excludes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in operating income in reflects a first quarter restructuring charge of million after taxes related to the implementation of a cost control initiative 
net income  which includes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in acquisition of executive risk inc 
in july  the chubb corporation corporation completed its acquisition of executive risk inc executive risk is a specialty insurance company offering primarily executive protection coverages  particularly directors and officers  errors and omissions and professional liability 
executive risk shareholders received shares of the corporation s common stock for each outstanding common share of executive risk 
in addition  outstanding executive risk stock options were converted to stock options of the corporation 
approximately million shares of common stock of the corporation were issued to executive risk shareholders and an additional million shares of common stock of the corporation were reserved for issuance upon exercise of the converted executive risk stock options 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of executive risk are included in the corporation s consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the assets and liabilities of executive risk were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the value of the stock options assumed by the corporation was included in the purchase price 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired  amounting to approximately million  has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized over years 
property and casualty insurance property and casualty income before taxes was million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in earnings in was due to deterioration in underwriting results caused in large part by the continued weakness in the standard commercial classes  which include multiple peril  casualty and workers compensation  and to a lesser extent  higher catastrophe losses 
the decrease in earnings in was due to a decline in underwriting results caused in large part by substantially higher catastrophe losses compared with and to a first quarter restructuring charge of million before taxes 
investment income increased in both and compared with the respective prior years 
catastrophe losses were million in  million in and million in the amount was net of reinsurance recoveries of approximately million related to hurricane georges 
we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during or since there were no individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
our initial retention level for each catastrophic event is approximately million in the united states and generally million outside the united states 
reported net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of compared with excluding premiums written by executive risk  premium growth was in personal coverages accounted for billion or of premiums written  standard commercial coverages for billion or and specialty commercial coverages for billion or 
reported net premiums written increased in compared with the reported growth in premiums written in was affected by the termination in of certain reinsurance agreements  which are discussed below 
for many years  a portion of the us insurance business written by the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries was reinsured on a quota share basis with a subsidiary of the sun alliance group plc 
similarly  a subsidiary of the corporation assumed a portion of sun alliance s property and casualty business on a quota share basis 
as a result of the merger of sun alliance with royal insurance holdings plc  the agreements pertaining to the exchange of reinsurance were terminated effective january  consequently  during  the property and casualty subsidiaries retained a greater portion of the business they wrote directly and assumed no reinsurance from sun alliance 
there was an additional impact on net premiums written in the first quarter of due to the effect of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums as of january of that year resulting from the changes in retention 
after adjusting reported net premiums for the effects of the termination of the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance  net premiums written increased in compared with premium growth in personal lines was strong in both and in commercial lines  intense competition in the worldwide marketplace has made profitable premium growth difficult  particularly in the standard commercial classes 
our priorities for were to renew good business at adequate prices and not renew underperforming accounts where we could not attain price adequacy 
we made steady progress in this regard during  increasing rates and non renewing underperforming business throughout the year 
further  many of our competitors also increased rates during the latter part of as a result  the pricing outlook in the standard commercial classes is considerably brighter than it was at the outset of substantial premium growth was achieved in and outside the united states  particularly in europe  our largest foreign market 
excluding the business that was assumed from sun alliance  non us premiums grew and in and  respectively  in original currency 
underwriting results were unprofitable in compared with near breakeven results in and profitable results in the combined loss and expense ratio  the common measure of underwriting profitability  was in compared with in and in the loss ratio was in compared with in and in losses from catastrophes represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in catastrophe losses affecting results in resulted primarily from weather related events in the united states winter storms in the first quarter  windstorms and tornadoes in the second quarter and hurricane floyd in the third quarter 
the catastrophe losses resulted primarily from the winter ice storms in canada in the first quarter  the wind and hail storms in the united states in the second quarter and hurricane georges in puerto rico in the third quarter 
our expense ratio was in compared with in and in the lower ratio in was due to salary and overhead expenses decreasing due to a cost control initiative discussed below and a change in accounting that resulted in the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use 
the increase in the expense ratio in was due primarily to an increase in commission expense caused in part by higher contingent payments and also to written premiums growing at a somewhat lesser rate than overhead expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced an activity value analysis process to identify and eliminate low value activities and improve operational efficiency while redirecting resources to activities having the greatest potential to contribute to the corporation s results 
implementation began in the first quarter of and was substantially completed by the end of that year 
the cost control initiative resulted in approximately job reductions in the home office and the branch network through a combination of early retirements  terminations and attrition 
other savings resulted from improved vendor management and lower consulting expenses and other operating costs 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the implementation of the cost control initiative 
of the million restructuring charge  million was comprised of accruals for providing enhanced pension benefits and postretirement medical benefits to employees who accepted an early retirement incentive offer and million was severance costs for employees who were terminated 
the remainder of the charge was for other expenses such as the cost of outplacement services 
the initiative was completed with no significant differences from the original estimates of the restructuring costs 
the liabilities related to the enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits were included in the pension and postretirement medical benefits liabilities  which will be reduced as benefit payments are made over time 
of the other restructuring costs  million remained unpaid at december  personal insurance our personal insurance business continued to produce exceptionally strong results in  measured by both growth and profitability 
reported net premiums from personal insurance increased in compared with a increase in after adjusting reported net premiums for the effects of the termination of the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance  premium growth in was compared with our in force policy count increased in by about for automobile  homeowners and other personal coverages 
such growth was achieved while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection 
premiums outside the united states grew significantly in and  although from a small base 
our personal insurance business produced substantial underwriting profits in each of the past three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in the profitability of our homeowners business each year is affected substantially by the amount of catastrophe losses we incur 
homeowners results were profitable by a similar margin in and as an unusually low frequency of non catastrophe related losses in substantially offset an increase in catastrophe losses 
homeowners results in were less profitable than in due to an increase in both catastrophe losses and non catastrophe losses 
the frequency of non catastrophe related losses returned to a more normal level in results in were also adversely affected by two large losses aggregating million net of reinsurance 
homeowners results were unprofitable outside the united states in each of the past three years as we are still building the critical mass necessary to absorb the costs of operating the franchise 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in our personal automobile business produced substantial profits in each of the last three years 
results in each year benefited from stable loss frequency and severity 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuables and excess liability  were highly profitable in each of the past three years  as favorable loss experience has continued 
standard commercial insurance reported net premiums from standard commercial insurance decreased in compared with a decrease in after adjusting reported net premiums for the effects of the termination of the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance  premiums increased in compared with the decrease in premiums in was the result of the strategy we put in place in late to renew good business at adequate prices and not renew underperforming business where we cannot attain price adequacy 
as a result  retention levels were lower in than in on the business that was renewed  rates have increased steadily throughout and we expect this trend to continue 
we achieved premium growth in and in standard commercial lines outside the united states 
our standard commercial insurance business produced substantial underwriting losses in each of the past three years  with results becoming increasingly unprofitable each year 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in it will take at least two annual renewal cycles to adequately reprice the entire standard commercial book  and during that time we will continue to have losses from underpriced business 
thus  it will be the latter part of before our pricing initiative is expected to have a noticeable effect on our standard commercial results 
multiple peril results were unprofitable in each of the past three years due  in large part  to inadequate prices 
such results were progressively more unprofitable each year 
in the liability component of this class  results deteriorated in and again in due to increases in the severity of losses 
results in were adversely affected by substantial incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
results for the property component deteriorated in due to higher catastrophe losses compared with property results deteriorated further in due primarily to several large losses overseas 
catastrophe losses in were similar to those in catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in results for our casualty business were unprofitable in each of the past three years 
results deteriorated in  primarily in the automobile and primary liability components 
in each year  but more so in and  casualty results were adversely affected by incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the excess liability component of our casualty coverages was modestly unprofitable in compared with the near breakeven results in and the profitable results in due to increases in the frequency of large losses as well as declining prices 
excess liability results in each of the past three years benefited from favorable development of prior year loss reserves 
results for the primary liability component were unprofitable in each of the past three years  but more so in and due to a higher frequency of large losses in those years 
results in the automobile component were increasingly unprofitable in each of the past three years due to an increase in the frequency of losses 
our commercial automobile book of business has been inadequately priced  a consequence of the prolonged soft market 
workers compensation results were unprofitable in each of the past three years  reflecting the cumulative effect of price reductions over the past several years 
results were also adversely affected in and by an increased frequency of large losses 
specialty commercial insurance reported net premiums from specialty commercial insurance increased by in compared with a increase in excluding premiums written by executive risk  premium growth was in after adjusting reported net premiums for the effects of the termination of the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance  premium growth in was compared with our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to differentiate our products continue to enable us to renew a large percentage of our executive protection and financial institutions business 
however  a competitive market continues to put prices under pressure for this business 
excluding premiums written by executive risk  executive protection premiums increased in while financial institutions premiums decreased 
property and marine premiums decreased due to the effect on retention levels of pricing initiatives and non renewing certain unprofitable accounts 
other specialty commercial business includes million of premiums in generated by chubb re  our reinsurance business that began operations during the year 
our specialty commercial business produced substantial underwriting profits in each of the last three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in property and marine results were unprofitable in each of the past three years 
the positive effect of the pricing initiatives and the culling of unprofitable accounts in was somewhat offset by higher catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses for this class represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in results in all three years were adversely affected by a high frequency of large property losses  including several overseas losses in and executive protection results were highly profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience on business worldwide  particularly in the directors and officers and fiduciary components 
however  such results were less profitable in due to the less adequate prices in recent years 
our financial institutions business was also profitable in each of the last three years due to favorable loss experience in the fidelity component of this business 
the standard commercial business written on financial institutions was unprofitable in and compared with profitable results in our other commercial classes produced profitable results in and compared with near breakeven results in the deterioration in was attributable to our aviation business  which produced highly unprofitable results 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years 
reinsurance assumed reinsurance assumed is treaty reinsurance that was assumed from sun alliance 
the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance was terminated effective january  however  due to the lag in our reporting of such business  our share of the sun alliance business for the last six months of was included in our results in the first quarter of such results were near breakeven 
loss reserves loss reserves are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability 
at the end of  gross loss reserves totaled billion compared with billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
reinsurance recoverable on such loss reserves was billion at year end compared with billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
at year end  gross loss reserves of billion and reinsurance recoverable of million were related to executive risk 
executive risk has historically utilized reinsurance to a greater extent because its size has limited the amount of risk it could retain 
loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in compared with million or in the increase in includes million of net reserves assumed in july upon the acquisition of executive risk 
the increase would have been million greater except that loss reserves were reduced by payments in that amount during the year related to the settlement of asbestos related claims against fibreboard corporation  which is discussed below 
excluding the executive risk reserves assumed and the fibreboard payments  loss reserves increased in substantial reserve growth has occurred each year in those liability classes  primarily excess liability and executive protection  that are characterized by delayed loss reporting and extended periods of settlement 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with favorable development of million in and million in such redundancies were reflected in operating results in these respective years 
each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim experience for certain liability classes  this was offset in part by losses incurred relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the higher favorable development in and compared with was due to more favorable loss experience for executive protection and excess liability coverages as well as the substantially lower incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the process of establishing loss reserves is a complex and imprecise science that reflects significant judgmental factors 
this is true because claim settlements to be made in the future will be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions  changing legislative  judicial and social environments and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the loss 
in fact  approximately of our net loss reserves at december  were for incurred but not reported ibnr losses claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments 
as a result of this and other societal and economic developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience continue to further complicate the already complex loss reserving process 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by inconsistent court decisions and judicial and legislative interpretations of coverage that in some cases have tended to erode the clear and express intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
our most costly asbestos exposure related to an insurance policy issued to fibreboard corporation by pacific indemnity company in as a result of events during that are described below  management believes that pacific indemnity s exposure with respect to asbestos related claims against fibreboard has ended 
in  pacific indemnity company  a subsidiary of the corporation  entered into a global settlement agreement with continental casualty company a subsidiary of cna financial corporation  fibreboard corporation  and attorneys representing claimants against fibreboard for all future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
this agreement was subject to final appellate court approval 
pursuant to the global settlement agreement  a billion trust fund would be established to pay future claims  defined as claims that were not filed in court before august  pacific indemnity would contribute approximately million to the trust fund and continental casualty would contribute the remaining amount 
in december  upon execution of the global settlement agreement  pacific indemnity and continental casualty paid their respective shares into an escrow account 
upon final court approval of the settlement  the amount in the escrow account  including interest earned thereon  would be transferred to the trust fund 
pacific indemnity and continental casualty reached a separate agreement in for the handling of all pending asbestos related bodily injury claims  defined as claims pending on august  against fibreboard 
pacific indemnity s obligation under this agreement with respect to such pending claims was approximately million  all of which was paid by the end of the agreement further provided that the total responsibility of both insurers with respect to pending and future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard would be shared between pacific indemnity and continental casualty on an approximate and basis  respectively 
at the same time  pacific indemnity  continental casualty and fibreboard entered into a trilateral agreement to settle all pending and future asbestos related bodily injury claims resulting from insurance policies that were  or may have been  issued to fibreboard by the two insurers 
the trilateral agreement would be triggered if the global settlement agreement was ultimately disapproved 
pacific indemnity s obligation under the trilateral agreement is therefore similar to  and not duplicative of  that under those agreements described above 
the trilateral agreement reaffirmed portions of an agreement reached in march between pacific indemnity and fibreboard 
among other matters  that agreement eliminated any pacific indemnity liability to fibreboard for asbestos related property damage claims 
in july  the united states district court of the eastern district of texas approved the global settlement agreement and the trilateral agreement 
the judgments approving these agreements were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
in july  the fifth circuit court affirmed the judgments of the district court 
the objectors to the global settlement agreement appealed to the united states supreme court 
in june  the supreme court refused to affirm approval of the global settlement agreement 
the case was returned to the united states district court of the eastern district of texas for further proceedings 
in september  the district court entered judgment disapproving the global settlement agreement 
that judgment was not appealed and became final in november the trilateral agreement was never appealed to the united states supreme court and is final 
upon final disapproval of the global settlement agreement  the trilateral agreement became effective 
in december  the funds that had been held in the escrow account were paid to a trust established to pay future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
we continue to have potentially significant asbestos exposure  primarily on those traditional defendants who manufactured  distributed or installed asbestos products for whom we wrote excess liability coverages 
such exposure has increased in recent years due to the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the non viability of other defendants 
our other potential asbestos exposures are mostly peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers and distributors of certain products that contain asbestos as well as premises owners 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  more peripheral parties have been drawn into litigation 
thus  we continue to receive notices of new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims despite the fact that practically all manufacturing and usage of asbestos ended nearly two decades ago 
uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to asbestos claims due to such factors as the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims 
significant issues remain unresolved  adding to the complexity and uncertainty of asbestos litigation 
these issues primarily involve questions regarding allocation of indemnity and expense costs and exhaustion of policy limits 
we are involved in disputes with other insurers and with insureds over these issues  which increase the difficulty of settlement negotiations 
hazardous waste sites are another significant potential exposure 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
the prps  with proper government authorization in many instances  disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
most sites have multiple prps 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically exclude such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up have become substantial  prps and others have increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  notwithstanding continued pressure by the insurance industry and other interested parties to achieve a legislative solution that would reform the liability provisions of the law  congress has not yet addressed the issue 
it is currently not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
the superfund law does not address non superfund sites 
for that reason  it does not cover all existing hazardous waste exposures  such as those involving sites that are subject to state law only 
there remains significant uncertainty as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
litigation costs remain substantial  particularly for hazardous waste claims 
a substantial portion of the funds we have expended to date has been for legal fees incurred in the prolonged litigation of coverage issues 
primary policies provide a limit on indemnity payments but many do not limit defense costs 
this unlimited defense provided in the policies sometimes leads to the payment of defense costs substantially exceeding the indemnity exposure 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
we have established case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
these reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
we have evaluated ultimate incurred losses using newly emerging techniques for estimating environmental liabilities and have expanded our claim data base 
as a result  we are somewhat more confident about the range of likely ultimate incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
therefore  the incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims were only million in and million in  substantially less than the million in further increases in such loss reserves in and future years are possible as legal and factual issues concerning these claims continue to be clarified 
the amount cannot be reasonably estimated 
management believes that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  management considers facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and the legislatures in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos and toxic waste claims  as well as the uncertainty in determining what scientific standards will be deemed acceptable for measuring hazardous waste site clean up  additional increases in loss reserves may emerge which would adversely affect results in future periods 
the amount cannot reasonably be estimated at the present time 
catastrophe exposure the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries have an exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas globally and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  we have used modeling technologies and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control catastrophe exposures 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
investments and liquidity growth in investment income in and was primarily due to increases in invested assets  which reflected strong cash flow from operations over the period  partially offset by lower average yields on new investments 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate fluctuates each year as a result of changes in the percentage of our portfolio invested in tax exempt bonds 
investment income after taxes increased in compared with and in compared with excluding the investment income of executive risk  such growth was in generally  premiums are received by our property and casualty subsidiaries months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
these funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments 
the balance is invested together with the investment income generated by the existing portfolio to build the portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
new cash available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately million in compared with million in and  million in new cash available in was not affected by the fibreboard related payments during the year since such payments were made from the escrow account that was funded in new cash in included approximately million received as the net result of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums and loss reserves as of january  related to the termination of the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance 
in  new cash was invested in tax exempt bonds and corporate bonds 
also  during  we reduced our equity securities portfolio by approximately million with million of the proceeds used to fund the purchase of a interest in hiscox plc  a leading uk personal and commercial specialty insurer 
in  new cash was invested primarily in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
in  new cash was invested in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  in the first quarter of  million of foreign denominated bonds were sold due to the reduction in foreign liabilities resulting from the termination of the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance  with the proceeds invested in us dollar denominated securities 
in each year  we tried to achieve the appropriate mix in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain sufficient investments in highly liquid  short term securities at all times to provide for immediate cash needs  and the corporation maintains bank credit facilities that are available to respond to unexpected cash demands 
corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest and other expenses not allocable to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate subsidiary 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with income of million in and million in the decrease in corporate and other income in and again in was due primarily to increasingly higher interest expense in each year 
real estate in october  we announced that we were exploring the possible sale of all or a significant portion of our real estate assets 
in november  our real estate subsidiary sold a substantial portion of its commercial properties for million  which included million in cash and the assumption of million in debt 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding short term debt and certain term loans and mortgages 
in the fourth quarter of  we had recorded an impairment loss of million  or million after taxes  to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in both and and million in  which amounts are included in the corporate and other results for those respective years 
revenues in included million from the november sale of real estate properties 
proceeds received from that sale that related to mortgages receivable are not classified as revenues 
in addition to the november sale  we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties in each of the past three years 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in revenues in and reflect the reduced operating activity as a result of the sale of a substantial portion of our real estate assets in we own approximately million of land which we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  we own approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
loans receivable  which were issued in connection with our joint venture activities and other property sales  are primarily purchase money mortgages 
such loans  which amounted to million at december   are generally collateralized by buildings and  in some cases  land 
we continually evaluate the ultimate collectibility of such loans and establish appropriate reserves 
the carrying value of the real estate assets we plan to dispose of in the near term is based on the estimated fair value of these assets 
the recoverability of the carrying value of the remaining real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the assumptions used reflect a continued improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized 
investment gains and losses net investment gains realized by the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries were as follows in millions equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
thus  realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year 
sales of equity securities in each of the last three years resulted in net realized investment gains due primarily to the significant appreciation in the united states equity markets 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
fixed maturity securities which the corporation and its insurance subsidiaries have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december   of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  and at december  the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments carried at market value  which includes equity securities and fixed maturities classified as available for sale  is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due to fluctuations in interest rates 
market risk the main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries relate primarily to the investment portfolio  which exposes the corporation to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries 
the table on the following page provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts

as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
taxable bonds in our domestic portfolio comprise us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
during  to increase our investment returns  we shifted a portion of the taxable portfolio from government agency mortgage backed securities and lower yielding us treasury securities to commercial mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
approximately of taxable bonds are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  approximately are rated aa or better with more than half rated aaa 
only of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
taxable bonds have an average maturity of years while tax exempt bonds mature on average in years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly and invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages

the remaining mortgage backed holdings were all in investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since their business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which we have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign investments of billion supporting their international operations 
such foreign investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling 
the table below provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these two currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  and actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
foreign currency denominated fixed maturities expected cash flows of principal amounts at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling equity price risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of equity securities 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market prices of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
interest rate risk also exists on our debt obligations 
at december   the expected cash flows of principal amounts of such debt obligations were a million term loan in  million of notes in and million after with a weighted average interest rate of 
year readiness disclosure the year issue referred to the potential that certain information technology it systems and applications as well as non it systems  such as equipment with embedded chips and microprocessors  would be unable to properly process data containing dates beginning with the year the issue existed because many computer systems used two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such systems  if not remediated  might have recognized the date as the year rather than the year  resulting in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of normal business activities or other unforeseen problems 
in  we initiated a project to ensure year readiness of the corporation s systems and applications 
a significant focus of the project was the retirement  renovation or rewriting of those mainframe systems that were not year ready 
from through  we completed remediation and testing procedures on all of our mainframe it systems as well as our personal computers  servers and other non mainframe computers and related software 
our year compliance project also included developing a plan to evaluate the readiness of third parties with whom we interact  preparing contingency plans to address the noncompliance of any such third parties and physically testing electronic data interchanges with third parties for year compliance 
as a result of these remediation efforts  our internal systems proved to be year ready and we did not have any significant year related difficulties interacting with any third party with whom we conduct business 
we have not experienced any disruption of our business and therefore we have not needed to implement any contingency plans 
the year team included employees of the corporation and software consultants 
a portion of the remediation effort was accomplished by redirecting existing systems resources to the year effort 
however  we do not believe that this had a significant adverse effect on other systems initiatives 
the cost to address the year it systems issue  including compensation of employees and the cost of consultants  approximated million 
approximately million  million and million was incurred in  and  respectively 
these amounts do not include the cost of computer equipment purchased to replace equipment that would have been upgraded in the normal course of business  but not necessarily prior to january future expenditures related to the year issue are expected to be negligible 
we have closely monitored the potential impact of the year issue on insurance coverages written by our property and casualty subsidiaries 
to date  we have received a relatively small number of claims related to the year issue 
the policies under which such claims have been made include provisions that we believe either preclude or limit the amount of coverage 
for these reasons  management does not believe at this time that there is a likelihood of a significant adverse financial impact from year related losses 
nevertheless  it is possible that year related losses may emerge that would adversely affect operating results in future periods
