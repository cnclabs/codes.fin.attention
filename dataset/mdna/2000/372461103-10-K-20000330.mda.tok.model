item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading supplier of advanced manufacturing systems for the worldwide semiconductor industry 
semiconductor manufacturers use our leading edge thin film deposition equipment and process technology to produce integrated circuits  commonly called chips  that are incorporated into a variety of products  including personal computers  communications equipment and consumer electronics 
we pioneered the development of chemical vapor deposition tungsten silicide  which is used in certain critical steps in the manufacture of integrated circuits 
in addition  we are leading the commercialization of atomic layer deposition  also known as ald technology 
this technology is designed to enable a wide spectrum of thin film applications such as aluminum oxide  tungsten nitride and other advanced dielectric and conducting metal barrier materials for advanced integrated circuit manufacturing 
we also continue to develop enabling thin film technology that addresses the scaling challenges facing the semiconductor industry relating to gate  capacitor and interconnect materials 
these challenges have been labeled as red zones by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors because there are no known solutions that allow for further reduction in feature sizes and improved performance 
our innovative thin film technology solutions are designed to enable chip manufacturers to simplify and advance their integrated circuit production processes and lower their total cost of manufacturing per chip  known as cost of ownership 
we provide a production proven platform that is used for both the development and production of new thin films in integrated circuit manufacturing 
this platform is based on common architecture and a high percentage of common parts that is designed to provide manufacturers with high reliability and low cost of ownership across a wide range of thin film deposition applications 
the modular design of our system permits manufacturers to add capacity and service their manufacturing systems easily 
in addition to the modular platform architecture  our systems operate on a standardized software that is designed to support a wide range of thin film deposition processes 
furthermore  our patented process chamber design incorporated into our flagship lynx product family can be configured for chemical vapor deposition  or cvd  plasma enhanced cvd  metal organic cvd and ald with minimal changes to the chamber design 
our global customer base consists of semiconductor manufacturers in the united states  europe and asia 
our current customers include semiconductor manufacturers such as infineon technologies  micron technology  inc and samsung electronics company  ltd 
in july  we sold certain assets and transferred certain liabilities related to the mev ion implant equipment product line to varian associates  inc for approximately million 
the net assets and liabilities we transferred to varian included inventory of million  capital equipment and other assets of million  and warranty and installation liabilities of million 
we no longer engage in the ion implant business and have refocused our efforts on thin film deposition 
in connection with the varian transaction and the refocusing of our business on thin film products  we significantly reduced our workforce at our sunnyvale  california location 
in  we recorded a restructuring and other charge of approximately million which included personnel changes of million associated with our workforce reduction  million in inventory write downs  million in leasehold improvement write offs  million for expenses associated with the closing of several sales offices  transaction losses as a result of the sale of the ion implant product line to varian  million for legal  accounting  and banking fees associated with the varian transaction and million for ion implant inventory related to the dispute with varian in connection with the varian transaction 
in  substantially all of our sales were derived from lynx system shipments for the tungsten silicide process application 
we shipped two new lynx products in which accounted for of total net sales in we anticipate a greater percentage of our revenue to be generated from new products in and beyond  because we believe that industry demand for these new technologies will continue to increase 
over the past few years  we were dependent on one customer  samsung  for a majority of our thin film product revenue 
samsung accounted for of our net sales in and in there is no long term agreement between us and samsung 
in  we shipped our lynx system to a new customer  micron technology  and in the first quarter of  received a purchase order for an ald system from infineon technologies  also a new customer 
revenue related to systems has been generally recognized upon shipment 
occasionally  revenue has been recognized on certain transactions where  prior to shipment and upon completion of customer source inspection and factory acceptance of the system  risk of loss and title to the system passes to the customer 
a provision for the estimated future cost of system installation  warranty and commissions is recorded when revenue is recognized 
see recent accounting pronouncements and risk factors our quarterly financial results fluctuate significantly and may fall short of anticipated levels  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for devices which use integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry suffered a significant downturn beginning in late this was a result of several factors  including the economic crisis in asia  semiconductor industry over capacity and reduced profitability for semiconductor manufacturers resulting from the decreasing prices of personal computers 
accordingly  many semiconductor manufacturers delayed planned new equipment purchases until  which significantly impacted our sales 
the overall market improved throughout  and accordingly we experienced higher thin film sales in compared with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment market continues to present challenges to us in terms of our ability to forecast both near and long term sales 
as such  we cannot assure you that this increase in sales represents a trend that will continue into the future 
international net sales  predominantly to customers based in south korea  accounted for of total net sales in  of total net sales in and of total net sales in to date  all sales have been denominated in us dollars 
we anticipate that international sales  and in particular from south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of our total net sales 
the local currency is the functional currency for our foreign operations in south korea and japan 
all other currency is dollar denominated 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
in order to support our business strategy  we will be required to make significant investments in research and development 
in addition  we believe selling  general and administrative costs will increase as sales volumes increase 
we depend on increases in sales in order to attain profitability 
if our sales do not increase  our current operating expenses could prevent us from attaining profitability and harm our financial results

years ended december  and net sales 
net sales in were million compared with net sales of million in  representing a decrease of 
the decline in our net sales was primarily due to the divestiture of the ion implant product line to varian  which contributed million of net sales in and none in  offset by increased demand for our thin film products as the semiconductor equipment industry emerged from the and recession 
our thin film product net sales of million was an increase of over from levels of thin film product sales 
export sales accounted for of our net sales in compared with in cost of goods sold 
costs of goods sold in was million compared with million in  representing a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume 
lower sales volumes were primarily due to the divestiture of the ion implant product line to varian 
the decrease was offset by million of inventory and warranty reserve reversals recorded in the fourth quarter of gross profit in was million  representing of net sales  compared with million or of net sales in our gross profits have historically been affected by variations in average selling prices  configuration differences  changes in the mix of product sales  unit shipment levels  the level of foreign sales and competitive pricing pressures 
research and development 
research and development expenses in were million compared with million in  representing a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were in and in substantially all of the decrease in research and development expenses is attributable to expenditures in associated with the ion implant product line 
thin film research and development spending in remained relatively constant with levels 
included in research and development expense in is a credit of  from a government small business innovative research grant for ald development 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in  representing a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in the million decrease in was due primarily to the reduction in our workforce related to the divestiture of the ion implant product line to varian in july as well as a million write off in relating to an ion implant receivable 
restructuring and other 
in  we recorded a charge of  for the final settlement of a dispute with varian that arose in connection with the sale of the ion implant product line to varian 
this charge related to funds that were held in escrow for possible claims made under our change of control agreements with key ion implant employees who transferred to varian as part of the varian transaction 
no funds were distributed from this escrow account  and the final change of control agreement expired in july other income expense  net 
we had other income of  in compared with other expense of  in other income in consisted of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains due to the strengthening of the korean won against the us dollar 
in  other expense included interest expense and foreign currency exchange losses during the first half of the year  partially offset by interest income during the second half of the year 
provision for income taxes 
we had income taxes of  in compared with immaterial income taxes in taxes in related to income from our south korean subsidiary 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of million and state net operating loss carry forwards of million 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales in were million compared with net sales of million in  representing a decrease of 
the decline in our sales was primarily due to the divestiture of the ion implant product line which contributed million of net sales in compared with million in  the continued recession in the semiconductor equipment industry and the adverse effect on our sales volumes caused by the lack of capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers due to dram production overcapacity 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in was million compared with million in  representing a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to depressed sales volumes in the first half of this decrease was offset by million of inventory and warranty reserve reversals recorded in the fourth quarter of gross profit in was million  representing of net sales  compared with million or of net sales in research and development 
research and development expenses in were million compared with million in  representing a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were in and in this decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to the divestiture of the ion implant product line 
thin film research and development spending of million in remained relatively constant with levels 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in  representing a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in compared with due to the divestiture of the ion implant product line and the reorganization of our business following this divestiture 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses in was a million write off of an ion implant receivable 
restructuring and other 
we recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million in which included personnel charges of million associated with our workforce reduction  million in inventory write downs  million in leasehold improvement write offs  million for expenses associated with the closing of several sales offices  transaction losses as a result of the sale of the ion implant product line  million for legal  accounting and banking fees associated with this sale and million for ion implant inventory related to the dispute with varian 
other income expense  net 
we had other expense of  in  compared with other expense of million in we had foreign currency exchange losses and interest expenses during the first half of which were partially offset by currency exchange gains and interest income during the second half of the year 
in  other expenses consisted primarily of currency exchange losses of million in the fourth quarter due to the weakening of the japanese yen and korean won against the us dollar 
provision for income taxes 
in  we had an immaterial tax provision 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset at december  would not be realized and  therefore  provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset resulting in a tax provision of million for liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million from cash and cash equivalents of million held as of december  at december   our accounts receivable was million  a decrease of million from accounts receivable of million at december  several systems shipped with extended payment terms in and remained in accounts receivable at december  accounts receivable related to these systems were collected in cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  and consisted of a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  and depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was also affected by the reported net loss in of million and an increase in inventories of million 
accounts receivable decreased due to the collection in of accounts receivable related to systems shipped with extended payment terms in accounts payable increased due to the timing of payments during the last two weeks of december 
inventories increased because we purchased and held more inventory to increase our production options 
most of this material is expected to be consumed during the first half of operating activities in used cash of million  primarily due to a million net loss  a million increase in inventories  a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable  and non cash charges for restructuring activities and depreciation and amortization of million 
financing activities of million in included payment of the short term borrowings of million  offset by  received from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock purchase and incentive stock option plans 
financing activities in used cash of million  primarily due to net repayments of short term bank borrowings 
we incurred capital expenditures of million during these expenditures principally related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment for our research and development and applications laboratories  expansion and upgrading of our sunnyvale  california facility  and the addition of a new enterprise resource planning business system 
we currently anticipate that additional capital expenditures will be funded through existing working capital or lease financing 
our primary source of funds at december  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  and million of accounts receivable  most of which we expect to collect or to have been collected during the first half of in november  we entered into a million revolving line of credit with venture bank 
amounts available under the line are based on of eligible accounts receivable  and borrowings under the line are secured by all corporate assets and bear interest at prime plus 
the line of credit expires in november the line of credit contains covenants that require us to maintain a minimum quick ratio and a maximum debt to tangible net equity ratio 
in addition  the line of credit requires us to have annual profitability beginning in and a maximum quarterly loss of million with no two consecutive quarterly losses 
additionally  we are prohibited from distributing dividends 
we were in default of certain of the covenants and venture bank has granted us a waiver of the default 
the amount available to borrow at december  was million at a rate of 
we expect to be in default of certain of the covenants at the end of the first quarter of  and venture bank has granted us a waiver of the default 
we have no borrowings under the line of credit 
we believe that our existing working capital  as well as the million venture bank line of credit  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the next months 
there can be no assurance that any required additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
year readiness disclosure we have designed our products to be year compliant  and as a result we have not experienced significant year problems related to our products 
the majority of the computer software and hardware that we use in our internal operations did not require replacement or modification as a result of the year issue 
we did  however  implement a new enterprise resource planning system to address year issues 
we believe that our significant vendors and service providers are year compliant and have not  to date  been made aware that any of our significant vendors or service providers have experienced year disruptions in their systems 
our estimated expenses on year issues through december  were approximately  of which approximately  was used to purchase and implement the enterprise resource planning system 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of any year problems 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  sfas established a new model for accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in july  the financial accounting standards boards issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas deferred the effective date of sfas until the first quarter beginning after june  the impact of sfas on the consolidated financial statements has not yet been determined 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the sec staff addresses several issues in sab no 
 including the timing for recognizing revenue derived from selling arrangements that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
our existing revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue at the time the customer takes title to the product  generally at the time of shipment  because we have  in the past  routinely met our installation obligations and obtained customer acceptance 
applying the requirements of sab no 
to our present selling arrangements for the sale of semiconductor production equipment may require a change in our accounting policy for revenue recognition and the deferral of the recognition of revenue from such equipment sales until installation is complete and accepted by the customer 
the effect of such a change  if any  must be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting no later than the quarter ending june  we believe the effects on liquidity  cash flow and financial position will not be material 
at the current time  it is not possible to determine the effect this change may have on our results of operations 
however  should the company be required to record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting  it will result in a charge to results of operations 
we are also considering potential changes to our standard contracts for equipment sales that could mitigate the potential impact of sab no 
on a going forward basis 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by  and the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
you should also refer to the other information included in this annual report on form k and the other information  our financial statements and the related notes incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
we have experienced losses over the last few years and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability we have experienced losses of million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
we may not be able to attain or sustain consistent future revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis  or achieve and maintain consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as a result  our business could be materially harmed 
substantially all of our net sales come from a small number of large customers historically  we have relied on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our net sales 
for example  samsung electronics company  ltd 
and micron technology  inc accounted of and of our net sales in respectively 
in addition  samsung electronics company  ltd  and micron technology  inc represented of accounts receivable at december  the semiconductor manufacturing industry generally consists of a limited number of larger companies 
we consequently expect that a significant portion of our future product sales will be concentrated within a limited number of customers 
none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement with us requiring them to purchase our products 
in addition  sales to these customers may decrease in the future when they complete their current semiconductor equipment purchasing requirements 
if any of our customers were to encounter financial difficulties or become unable to continue to do business with us at or near current levels  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
customers may delay or cancel orders or may stop doing business with us for a number of reasons including customer departures from historical buying patterns  general market conditions  economic conditions  or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing integrated circuits 
our quarterly financial results fluctuate significantly and may fall short of anticipated levels  which could cause our stock price to decline our net sales and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems  many of which may be ordered and shipped during the same quarter 
our results of operations for a particular quarter could be materially adversely affected if anticipated orders  for even a small number of systems  were not received in time to enable shipment during the quarter  anticipated shipments were delayed or canceled by one or more customers or shipments were delayed due to manufacturing difficulties 
at our current revenue level  each sale  or failure to make a sale  could have a material effect on us 
our lengthy sales cycle  coupled with our customers competing capital budget considerations  make the timing of customer orders uneven and difficult to predict 
in addition  our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter 
as a result  our net sales and operating results for a quarter depend on us shipping orders as scheduled during that quarter as well as obtaining new orders for systems to be shipped in that same quarter 
any delay in scheduled shipments or in shipments from new orders would materially and adversely affect our operating results for that quarter  which could cause our stock price to decline 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
prior to sab  we generally recognized revenue upon shipment of a system 
applying the requirements of sab to the present selling arrangements we use for the sale of semiconductor production equipment may require a change in our accounting policy for revenue recognition and deferral of the recognition of revenue from such equipment sales until installation is complete and accepted by the customer 
the effect of such a change  if any  must be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting no later than the quarter ending june  although sab applies to every company within our industry  there is a risk that our stock price may be materially and adversely impacted by sab if we are required to transition from recognizing revenue at shipment  to customer acceptance of a system 
since it is possible that there may be a shift in revenue recognition from the time of shipment to the time of acceptance by the customer  certain revenue that we would have recognized in the first and second quarters of upon shipment of products may not be recognized until the products are accepted 
we cannot assure you as to the timing of such acceptances 
any material delay in receipt of acceptances may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are highly dependent on our international sales  particularly sales in asian countries  and face risks beyond our control or influence export sales accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales in  and  respectively 
net sales to our south korean based customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales during the same periods 
we anticipate that international sales  including sales to south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
as a result  a significant portion of our net sales will be subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in law or regulatory requirements  exchange rate volatility  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  extended payment terms  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing our subsidiaries  difficulties in managing foreign subsidiary operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our foreign sales are primarily denominated in us dollars and we do not engage in hedging transactions 
as a result  our foreign sales are subject to the risks associated with unexpected changes in exchange rates  which could effect the price of our products 
in the past  turmoil in the asian financial markets resulted in dramatic currency devaluations  stock market declines  restriction of available credit and general financial weakness 
for example  prices fell dramatically in as some integrated circuit manufacturers sold drams at less than cost in order to generate cash 
currency devaluations make dollar denominated goods  such as ours  more expensive for international customers 
in addition  difficult economic conditions may limit capital spending by our customers 
these circumstances may also affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  resulting in the cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders 
as a result of any or all these factors  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed 
our sales reflect the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and could cause us to fail to achieve anticipated sales our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and experiences periodic downturns both of which reduce the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment 
semiconductor industry downturns have significantly decreased our revenues  operating margins and results of operations in the past 
there is a risk that our revenues and operating results will be materially harmed by any future downturn in the semiconductor industry 
our future growth is dependent on acceptance of new thin films and market acceptance of our systems relating to those thin films we believe that our future growth will depend in large part upon the acceptance of our new thin films 
as a result  we expect to continue to invest in research and development in these new thin films and the systems that use these films 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept our new products or that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a timely manner to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could harm sales of existing products 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of our tungsten silicide cvd systems 
we estimate that the life cycle for these systems is three to five years 
there is a risk that future technologies  processes or product developments may render our product offerings obsolete and we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner 
we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry against competitors with greater resources the semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will require significant financial resources in order to develop new products  offer a broader range of products  establish and maintain customer service centers and invest in research and development 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources  more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  customer service capabilities and greater name recognition 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics 
if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering thin film products similar to those sold by us  it would materially adversely our ability to sell our products to such manufacturers 
in addition  to expand our sales we must often replace the systems of our competitors or sell new systems to customers of our competitors 
our competitors may develop new or enhanced competitive products that will offer price or performance features that are superior to our systems 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their product lines 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are not able to respond effectively 
we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are not selected as vendor of choice for new or expanded fabrication facilities and if our systems and products do not achieve broader market acceptance because semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor fabrication facility  these manufacturers will tend to choose semiconductor equipment manufacturers based on established relationships  product compatibility and proven financial performance 
once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular vendor s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies for a significant period of time upon equipment from this vendor of choice for the specific production line application 
in addition  the semiconductor manufacturer frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  we may face narrow windows of opportunity to be selected as the vendor of choice by potential new customers 
it may be difficult for us to sell to a particular customer for a significant period of time once that customer selects a competitor s product  and we may not be successful in obtaining broader acceptance of our systems and technology 
if we are not able to achieve broader market acceptance of our systems and technology  we may be unable to grow our business and our operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
our lengthy sales cycle increases our costs and reduces the predictability of our revenue sales of our systems depend upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity 
that decision typically involves a significant capital commitment by our customers 
accordingly  the purchase of our systems typically involves time consuming internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and introduction of new technologies into our customers manufacturing facilities 
for many potential customers  an evaluation as to whether new semiconductor manufacturing equipment is needed typically occurs infrequently 
following an evaluation by the customer as to whether our systems meet its qualification criteria  we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future delays in finalizing system sales while the customer evaluates and receives approval for the purchase or our systems and constructs a new facility or expands an existing facility 
due to these factors  our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort 
the time between our first contact with a customer and the customer placing its first order typically lasts from nine to twelve months and is often even longer 
this lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to accurately forecast future sales and may cause our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
if anticipated sales from a particular customer are not realized in a particular period due to this lengthy sales cycle  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we are dependent on our intellectual property and risk loss of a valuable asset  reduced market share and litigation expense if we cannot adequately protect it our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
we currently have a number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with competitive advantages 
from time to time  we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties patent rights by our products 
in such cases  it is our policy to defend against the claims or negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms where appropriate 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we are dependent upon key personnel who are employed at will  who would be difficult to replace and whose loss would impede our development and sales we are highly dependent on key personnel to manage our business  and their knowledge of business  management skills and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of dr 
william wr elder  our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
thomas e 
seidel  our chief technology officer  and other key managerial and technical employees who would be difficult to replace 
the loss of dr 
elder or dr 
seidel or other key employees could limit or delay our ability to develop new products and adapt existing products to our customers evolving requirements and would also result in lost sales and diversion of management resources 
none of our executive officers are bound by a written employment agreement  and the relationships with our officers are at will 
because of competition for additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel  which could impede development or sales of our products 
our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced engineering  technical  financial  sales and marketing personnel in our industry 
in particular  we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are based 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to customers  or fail to meet delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in substantial liability to us we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment 
these include laws  rules and regulations governing the use  storage  discharge  release  treatment and disposal of hazardous chemicals during and after manufacturing  research and development and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  property damage  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
restrictions on our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be imposed upon us or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for many components and subassemblies  and supply shortages or the loss of these suppliers could result in increased cost or delays in manufacture and sale of our products certain of the components and sub assemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
disruption or termination of these sources could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon six distributorships for the sale of our products and any disruption in these relationships would adversely effect us we currently sell and support our thin film products through direct sales and customer support organizations in the us  europe  south korea and japan and through six independent sales representatives and distributors in the us  europe  south korea  taiwan  china and malaysia 
we do not have any long term contracts with our sales representatives and distributors 
any disruption or termination of our existing distributor relationships could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are establishing a direct sales organization in japan which could result in lost sales or increased risks to our business in japan as part of our original strategy for penetrating the japanese market  we established a distribution relationship with innotech corp 
in  we shifted our strategy in japan to a direct sales model 
we have terminated our distribution relationship with innotech and are establishing our own direct sales force in japan 
although we intend to continue to invest significant resources in japan  including the hiring of additional personnel to support our direct sales effort  we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to the japanese semiconductor industry 
we may miss sales opportunities or lose competitive sales as we transition to this direct sales model  and our existing japanese customers and potential customers may be unwilling to purchase our systems from us directly 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which may lead to losses by investors or to securities litigation our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our  our competitors or our customers actual or anticipated financial results  our competitors or our customers announcements of technological innovations  revenue recognition policies  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and other events or factors 
also  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of many technology companies  in particular  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic and political conditions in the united states and the countries in which we do business  may adversely effect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in the company s stock price 
this type of litigation  if filed against us  could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
year complications may disrupt our operations because  while our upgraded internal systems are operational and the cost of upgrades was not material  we rely on external systems that may not be adequately upgraded for year the date fields coded in many software products and computer systems need to be able to distinguish st century dates from th century dates  including leap year calculations 
the failure to be able to accurately distinguish these dates is commonly known as the year problem 
while we have yet to experience year problems  the computer software programs and operating systems used in our internal operations  including our financial  product development  order management and manufacturing systems  could experience errors or interruptions due to the year problem 
for example  a significant failure of our computer integrated manufacturing systems  which monitor and control factory equipment  could disrupt manufacturing operations and cause a delay in completion and shipping of products 
in addition  it is possible that our suppliers and service providers failure to adequately address the year problem could have an adverse effect on their operations  which  in turn  could have an adverse impact on us 
forward looking statements some of the information in this annual report on form k and in the documents that are incorporated by reference  including the risk factors  contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in many cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  or continue  or the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks faced by us described above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our shareholders 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control 
the risk factors listed above  as well as any cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as our business practices evolve and could seriously harm our financial results 
all of our international sales  except spare parts and service sales made by our subsidiary in south korea  are currently denominated in us dollars 
all spare parts and service sales made by the south korean subsidiary are won denominated 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  reduce the demand for our products 
reduced demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents or increase any interest expense owed on the line of credit facility 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rates exposures
