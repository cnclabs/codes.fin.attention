item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition financial overview our revenues are generated from the sale of products in two principal product categories spinal implant products and orthobiologic products 
our spinal implant products consist of titanium or stainless steel hooks  rods and screws and related instruments required for the surgeon to assemble a construct which restores the natural anatomy of the spine  keeping it immobilized while a bone graft eventually fuses the vertebrae 
our orthobiologic products consist of synthetic bone graft substitute materials and products used to derive agf 
agf is used to provide faster  more complete bone growth and enhance the performance of our bone graft products 
in may  interpore international  inc merged with cross medical products  inc  combining interpore s orthobiologics expertise and product offering with cross spinal implant expertise and products 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and all financial information related to periods prior to the merger has been restated to reflect the financial information of both companies as if we had always been a combined entity 
all of our operations are located in the united states  however  we sell our products to customers both within and outside the united states 
in  our domestic sales were of total sales and our international sales were of total sales 
within the united states  we distribute our products primarily through independent agents 
these independent agents provide a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and receive commissions based on sales in their territories 
the commissions are reflected in our income statement within selling and marketing expense 
for our spinal implant products  we invoice hospitals directly following a surgical procedure in which our products are used 
our spinal implant products are made available to hospitals from consignment inventories maintained by our larger independent agents  or from loaner implant sets that we ship from our facility 
for our orthobiologic products  we generally ship directly to hospitals from our facility  and we invoice hospitals upon shipment 
outside the united states  we sell our products directly to distributors who maintain an inventory of our products 
we record revenue at the time of shipment to the distributor at prices generally ranging from to of our us list prices 
the distributors service the surgeons and hospitals  deliver products and invoice hospitals directly at prices determined by the distributors 
because our revenues from us hospitals are primarily at list price  and our revenues from international distributors are at a discount to us list prices  our gross margins are subject to fluctuation based on our domestic versus international sales mix  with domestic gross margins being somewhat higher than international gross margins 
additionally  the mix between spinal implant sales and orthobiologic sales also affects our gross margins  with higher margins in orthobiologics 
financial trends we experienced operating losses in the years through factors contributing to the losses through include our significant investment in the development of our spinal implant business and declining sales and profitability in our former dental implant business  which was sold in may the  loss from operations in included a  loss on the sale of our dental implant business and a  unfavorable adjustment for inventory made obsolete by our synergy spinal system enhancements 
in  we had a million operating loss which included approximately million in non recurring charges  including charges related to our merger with cross 
however  without the non recurring charges  we would have had operating profit of million in  representing of sales 
in  our revenue grew by  and we had an operating profit of million  or of sales 
we believe the improved performance was primarily the result of the following 
the successful recruiting of more experienced independent agents and sales managers from our larger spinal implant competitors  which improved our revenue growth rate  
incremental profit from increased revenues  including over million in sales of newly introduced agf related products  and 
cost reductions and operating efficiencies resulting from the consolidation of operations following the merger of interpore and cross 
despite our operating losses in the years through  we reported positive income from continuing operations 
this resulted from the recognition of deferred tax assets which had previously been fully reserved in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
in  despite a pre tax loss  taxable income was recognized as a result of some disallowed merger cost deductions 
this coupled with the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a net tax provision of  in  our increased profitability eliminated the remaining valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this resulted in the need to record an income tax provision for the quarter and year ended december   and we expect to record tax provisions going forward 
therefore  the recording of tax provisions will negatively affect net income for the year in comparison to had we recorded an income tax provision in at an effective tax rate of  our diluted earnings per share would have been versus the that we reported 
all of the information set forth above relates to our continuing operations 
however  discontinued operations contributed significantly to net income in and income from discontinued operations was million in and million in  including a million gain on the sale of our recovery products segment in march results of operations the following table presents our results of operations as percentages percentage change percentage of net sales year ended december  vs

selling and marketing expenses in increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to increased commissions on higher domestic sales in and the hiring of additional sales and marketing staff 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  in  primarily as the result of increased corporate bonus expense and higher product liability insurance premiums resulting from increased sales offset partially by a decrease in property taxes resulting from the closure of the ohio facility 
total interest and other income were approximately the same in the two periods  as reduced interest income on lower average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances in was mostly offset by reduced interest expense 
we had lower average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances in compared to due to the payment of merger related expenses  restructuring charges and non recurring charges  the repurchase of  shares of our common stock and the redemption of convertible debentures 
interest expense was lower in than in due primarily to the write off of prepaid debt issuance costs associated with convertible debentures which were redeemed during this redemption also lowered interest expense in in  despite a pre tax loss  taxable income was recognized as a result of some disallowed merger cost deductions

sales of orthobiologic products increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  pro osteon sales increased by million  due to the introduction of the resorbable version  pro osteon r  in the fourth quarter of  along with improved distribution following the merger and resultant consolidation of sales forces

general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  in  primarily as the result of cost reductions following the sale of the dental business and the merger with cross 
the  or  decrease in net interest and other income relates to a reduction in interest income due to lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the decrease was partially offset by increased royalty income

liquidity and capital resources in  our operations generated positive cash flow of approximately million 
we invest our excess cash in us treasury securities and high grade marketable securities 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  up million from million at december  we also have a million revolving line of credit available to us that had no amount outstanding at december  and which expires in june we currently intend to seek an extension of that facility 
other significant sources of cash in the past included million in proceeds from the sale of our recovery products segment in and million in net proceeds in and from the sale of our dental business 
we have used and may continue to use our cash  our common stock  or a combination of both to pay for purchased technologies  product lines  mergers and acquisitions 
we also intend to continue to invest in the development of our business 
in  we merged with cross and exchanged approximately million shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding common stock of cross 
in  we purchased all of the intellectual property of quantic biomedical  inc  which included all of the agf patents and technology  for  in cash   unregistered shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we believe we currently possess sufficient resources to meet the cash requirements of our operations for at least the next year 
however  some of the aforementioned activities may require cash in excess of that which we currently possess  and we can give no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional capital on satisfactory terms  if at all 
at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
impact of year year problems are the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by not recognizing to mean the year in  we completed our testing of all critical software and hardware systems and determined that all are year compliant 
vendor certifications were received from all critical vendors indicating that they were either currently compliant or that they would be compliant by december  to date  we have not needed to implement any major system or software replacements due to the year issue 
we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material direct costs associated with year issues 
we have not experienced and do not expect to experience any significant year problems or interruptions 
we cannot assure you that mission critical vendors and customers will not incur a year problem or interruption  but we believe we have adequate computer file backup procedures and manual operating procedures that will enable us to continue the critical processes of our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash and cash equivalent balances and marketable securities 
however  as all of our investments are in short term instruments  we believe that we have no material market risk exposure
