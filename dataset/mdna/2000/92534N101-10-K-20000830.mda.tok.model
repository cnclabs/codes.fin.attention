on april   iplace  inc acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of qspace  inc in exchange for iplace stock valued at approximately million

these three acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  with the purchase prices allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition

therefore  the results of operations of cic  eneighborhoods and qspace are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition  net of minority interest after february  new accounting pronouncements the securities and exchange commission staff the staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab in december sab establishes the staff s preference that membership fees should not be recognized in earnings prior to the expiration of refund privileges 
notwithstanding the staff s preference described above  it is also stated in sab that the staff will not object to the recognition of refundable membership fees  net of estimated refunds  as earned revenue over the membership period the company s current method of accounting in limited circumstances where all of certain criteria set forth in sab have been met 
the company plans to voluntarily adopt the full deferral method of accounting for membership fee revenue for all of the company s membership programs having full refund privileges effective july  consequently  membership fees having full refund privileges  and the related direct costs associated with acquiring the underlying memberships  will no longer be recognized on a prorata basis over the corresponding membership periods  but instead will be recognized in earnings upon the expiration of membership refund privileges 
if sab had been adopted effective july   the cumulative effect of the accounting change would have been a one time non cash charge of million 
the impact of the change for the fiscal year ended june  would have been to increase revenues by million and increase net income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change by million  or per diluted share 
the amounts for the fiscal year ended june  include a portion of the membership fees and associated direct costs previously recognized in fiscal earnings 
while management has not yet completed its analysis of the impact  the amount of the one time non cash charge to be recorded as of july  is estimated to be between million and million 
the cumulative effect of the change at july  represents the deferral of previously recognized membership fees net of estimated refunds and associated direct costs 
the membership fees  net of estimated refunds and associated direct costs  which will be deferred as part of the cumulative effect adjustment at july   will be recognized in earnings during fiscal year as the underlying refund privileges expire 
as a result of this change in accounting  fiscal results will be adversely affected 
the company expects this change to result in a reduction of earnings of million to million  or per share to per share 
the estimated adverse impact of the accounting change on net income is due to a delay in the revenue  net of direct costs  without a corresponding delay in increasing operating and general and administrative costs necessary for the continued growth of the company s membership base 
this change in accounting for the recognition of membership fees in income will have no impact on the company s cash flows or on the economic value of the underlying memberships

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate the company has a million bank credit facility which bears interest at the higher of the base commercial lending rate for the bank or the federal funds rate plus per annum 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this bank credit facility as of june  in addition  the company s canadian subsidiary  memberworks canada  has a million bank credit facility which bears interest at the royal bank of canada prime rate per annum 
as of june   the company had million outstanding under this bank credit facility 
management believes that an increase in the commercial lending rate or the federal funds rate would not be material to the company s financial position or its results of operations 
if the company is not able to renew its existing credit facility agreements  which mature on august  and october   it is possible that any replacement lending facility obtained by the company may be more sensitive to interest rate changes 
the company does not currently hedge interest rates with respect to its outstanding debt 
foreign currency the company has international sales and facilities and is  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
historically  its international sales have been denominated in british pounds sterling 
however  with the recent acquisition of a canadian subsidiary  certain sales are denominated in the canadian dollar 
the functional currencies of the company s foreign operations are the local currencies 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations  and were not material for all periods presented 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic condition 
to the extent the company incurs expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volume paid in local currency  the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced 
the company has determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
memberworks will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
fair value memberworks does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
in february  the company sold its equity interest in awardtrack  inc in exchange for stock in media  inc 

the carrying value of this investment is affected by changes in the quoted market prices of common stock 
the company determines  on a quarterly basis  the fair market value of the shares and records an unrealized gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair market value from the previous quarter to the measurement date 
if the company sells all or a portion of this stock  any unrealized gain or loss on the date of the sale will be recorded as a realized gain or loss in the company s results of operations 
any future significant decline in market value could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements
