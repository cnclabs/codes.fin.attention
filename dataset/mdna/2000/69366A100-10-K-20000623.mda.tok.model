the following table sets forth certain liquidity trends of the company for the periods presented in millions fiscal year ended liquidity trends cash and investments working capital results of operations fiscal was a challenging year for the healthcare industry and specifically the company 
in addition  the fourth quarter was significantly difficult for several reasons 
first  the balanced budget act of and the implementation of its prospective payment system pps financially impacted many segments of healthcare  including many  if not all  of the customers  distributors and manufacturers in the long term care industry 
the company s long term care division distributes to approximately  customers representing approximately million long term care beds  of which a dozen customers representing approximately  homes and  long term care beds  or approximately  filed for chapter or bankruptcy protection in fiscal several of the long term care division s largest customers resolved or disclosed their plans for unsecured creditors  including the company  in the fourth quarter ending march  as a result  in the fourth quarter  the long term care division recorded million of specific customer receivable reserves and million in general customer receivable reserves 
in addition  the imaging business recorded million of specific customer receivable reserves related to branch shutdowns where there was a discontinuation of the business relationships and related to computer integration where there was a loss of records 
in addition  during the third quarter  the company s long term care business customer receivables increased approximately million due to its restructuring plan and the move of the collection efforts from jackson  ms to jacksonville  fl 
in the fourth quarter  the company estimated it incurred of incremental interest expense and of incremental labor and collection costs to restore collection effectiveness in jacksonville  fl to the previous customer receivable levels 
in addition  in response to the above referenced credit difficulties the company placed approximately  long term care customers on credit hold  which is estimated to have reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately million and operating profit by approximately million 
the company has subsequently been able to remove approximately  customers from credit hold due to customer payments 
second  the company s two most significant suppliers had manufacturing product recalls and production issues which materially disrupted availability of products to the company s physician and imaging divisions 
the physician division supplier  which represents approximately of its revenues  had both an fda negotiated recall and a specific product line supplier recall 
the company estimates the impact to its fourth quarter was as follows pre tax operating revenues profit estimated loss from recall of products   estimate of equipment and medical supply loss due to the sales force and product specialists removed from their normal sales function to support the recall  replacement and transition function   estimate of lost leasing fees  vendor incentives  rebates and other costs  inventory reserve recorded for recalled reagents  the imaging division supplier which represents approximately of its revenues had a manufacturing production related disruption that created a material back order of equipment and parts 
the company estimates that the impact on its fourth quarter of fiscal was as follows for the imaging division pre tax operating revenues profit estimated lost orders from unavailable equipment supply   estimated lost orders from parts supply and related service labor third  due to the poor stock performance of the company and issues described above  the company announced that it had hired donaldson  lufkin jenrette dlj to assist the company in evaluating various strategic alternatives 
this announcement caused a significant distraction for the employees of the company  of which the impact in the fourth quarter on revenues and operating profit cannot be sufficiently estimated by the company 
in addition  the company had several items totaling million which came to the attention of the company in the fourth quarter which are a result of yk inventory buildup  branch shutdowns and reserves which the company believes are not part of ongoing operations 
the company also had unusual charges included in continuing operations for merger activity  restructuring activity and other special items see note  changes included in general and administrative expenses in fiscal of  and in the fourth quarter of  the table below sets forth for each of the fiscal years through certain financial information as a percentage of net sales

during the three months ended april   a million allowance for obsolete inventory charge was recorded 
this charge is directly related to a change of plans  uses  and disposition efforts which new gulf south management had as compared to prior management 
gulf south previously disclosed in its fiscal form k that they had generally been able to return any unsold or obsolete inventory to the manufacturer  resulting in negligible inventory write offs 
gulf south s prior management had a policy of keeping old or overstocked inventory on the warehouse shelf until the inventory could ultimately be sold 
as such  this policy kept the inventory on the books with what was deemed to be an appropriate obsolescence reserve 
new management  on the other hand  determined that it was not cost effective  from an operational standpoint  to continue warehousing and financing such old or overstocked inventory 
also  the company does not normally allow product with less than desirable box or labeling conditions to be shipped to its customers 
as such  consistent with the operational policies at the company s other divisions  management decided to dispose of certain inventories that did not meet the company s dating  box condition  or labeling requirements  or in which excessive quantities existed 
this decision to significantly alter gulf south s inventory retention and buying policies  and  therefore  to dispose of the related inventories resulted in a change in the ultimate valuation of the impacted inventories 
this charge was recognized in the period in which management made the decision to dispose of the affected inventory  which was gulf south s quarter ended april  additionally  during the quarter ending april   a million charge was recorded to reconcile gsms financial statements to its underlying books and records

direct transaction costs primarily consist of professional fees  such as investment banking  legal  and accounting  for services rendered through the date of the merger 
as of march   all direct transaction costs were paid 
due to subsequent negotiations and agreements between the company and a service provider  actual costs paid were less than costs originally billed and recorded 
as a result  approximately of costs were reversed against general and administrative expenses during the quarter ended september  restructuring costs and expenses 
in order to improve customer service  reduce costs  and improve productivity and asset utilization  the company decided to realign and consolidate its operations with gulf south 
the restructuring costs and expenses  which directly relate to the merger with pss world medical  inc  were recorded during the three months ended april  during this time period  management approved and committed to a plan to integrate and restructure the business of gulf south

the company reviewed all available information  including tax exemption notices received  and recorded charges to expense  during the period in which the tax noncompliance issues arose 
see note  charges included in general and administrative expenses  for more discussion related to this issue 
goodwill impairment charges 
the  goodwill impairment charge relates primarily to a prior gulf south acquisition 
during the quarter ended april   a dispute with the acquired company s prior owners and management resulted in the loss of key employees and all operational information related to the acquired customer base 
this ultimately affected gulf south s ability to conduct business related to this acquisition  and impacted gulf south s ability to recover the value assigned to the goodwill asset 
selling expenses 
selling expenses for the three months ended april  totaled million  an increase of million or over the three months ended march  total of million 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses decreased to for the three months ended april  from for the three months ended march  the decrease in selling expense as a percentage of net sales is the result of the increase in the portion of the customer base represented by national chain customers on which gulf south does not pay sales commissions 
loss income from operations 
loss from operations for the three months ended april  totaled million  a decrease of million or over the three months ended march  income from operations of million

the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to the factors discussed in gross profit and charges included in general and administrative expenses above 
liquidity and capital resources as the company s business grows  its cash and working capital requirements will also continue to increase as a result of the need to finance acquisitions and anticipated growth of the company s operations 
this growth will be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations  revolving credit borrowings and proceeds from any future public offerings

the company had annualized inventory turnover of x and x times for the years ended march  and april  for the year ended march   the company s physician supply  imaging  and long term care businesses had annualized inventory turnover of x  x  and x  respectively 
inventory financing historically has been achieved through negotiating extended payment terms from suppliers 
the company has historically been able to finance its liquidity needs for expansion through lines of credit provided by banks and proceeds from the public and private offering of stock and debt 
in may  the company completed an initial public offering of common stock resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
in november  the company completed a secondary offering of common stock 
the company used approximately million and million of the total secondary offering net proceeds of million to repay company debt and debt assumed through acquisitions in fiscal years and  respectively 
management used the remaining proceeds in connection with acquisitions for the imaging  physician supply  and international businesses  and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures during fiscal years and on october   the company issued  in a private offering under rule a of the securities act of  an aggregate principal amount of million of its senior subordinated notes due in the private notes with net proceeds to the company of million after deducting offering costs 
the private notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
on february   the company closed its offer to exchange the private notes for senior subordinated notes the notes of the company with substantially identical terms to the private notes except that the notes do not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions 
interest on the notes accrues from the date of original issuance and is payable semiannually on april and october of each year  commencing on april   at a rate of per annum 
the semiannual payments of approximately million will be funded by the operating cash flow of the company 
no other principal payments on the notes are required over the next five years 
the notes contain cross covenants to the company s senior revolving facility and certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness

as of march   the company was not in compliance with the following covenants under the senior revolving credit facility consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated leverage ratio  and annual capital expenditure limits 
however  the company obtained a waiver from the lending group for the period ended march  management believes it is probable that the company will meet these covenants in future periods  or that appropriate waivers will be obtained 
as such  the related debt has been classified as non current as of march  as of march   the company has not entered into any material working capital commitments that require funding 
the company believes that the expected cash flows from operations  available borrowing under the credit facility  and capital markets are sufficient to meet the company s anticipated future requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company did not hold any derivative financial or commodity instruments 
the company is subject to interest rate risk and certain foreign currency risk relating to its operations in europe  however  the company does not consider its exposure in such areas to be material

risk factors affecting results of operations we face numerous risks related to our pending transaction 
on june   we announced that we had entered into an agreement and plan of merger dated june  with fisher scientific international  inc  pursuant to which pss and fisher will combine business operations and pss will become a wholly owned subsidiary of fisher 
the merger is subject to various conditions  including approval of the shareholders of pss and fisher  filings with and compliance with securities and antitrust laws  the financial and operating performance of pss and certain other matters 
in particular  the transaction is conditioned upon our meeting a minimum ebitda threshold for our quarter ended june   retaining customers and suppliers that are material to our business and the successful rollout of our new technology systems 
we cannot assure you that the merger will occur in a timely manner  if at all 
in the event the merger is terminated under circumstances addressed in the merger agreement  we will owe a significant fee to fisher of million 
in addition  the merger may adversely affect our relationships with our employees and sales force  customers and suppliers 
our pursuit of strategic alternatives and the merger have diverted the attention of our management and employees and may continue to do so 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly and may be below analysts and investors expectations in any particular quarter 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of many factors  including o fluctuating demand for our products and services  o the introduction of new products and services by us and our competitors  o acquisitions or investments  o changes in manufacturers prices or pricing policies  o changes in the level of operating expenses  o changes in estimates used by management  o product supply shortages  o product recalls by manufacturers  o inventory adjustments  o changes in product mix  and o general competitive and economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter that may be impacted by the above factors result from orders recorded in such quarter and  in particular  toward the end of such quarter 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in certain future periods our operating results may be below analysts and investors expectations 
this could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
pricing and customer credit quality pressures due to reduced spending budgets by health care providers may impair our revenues  the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our earnings 
the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the united states is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid  and corporate health insurance plans 
in recent years  government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers have significantly impacted spending budgets in certain markets within the medical products industry 
in particular  recent changes in the medicare program have limited payments to providers in the long term care industry  the principal customers of our gulf south subsidiary 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july   medicare s prospective payment system was applied to the long term care industry 
this prospective payment system will limit government payments to long term care providers to federally established cost levels 
prior to this time  the long term care facilities were reimbursed by the medicare program pursuant to a cost based reimbursement system 
this shift was designed to encourage greater provider efficiency and to help stem the growth in reimbursement relating to the care of long term care patients 
under the prospective payment system  the customers of our gulf south subsidiary are now receiving revenues that are substantially less than they received under cost based reimbursement 
in addition  private third party reimbursement plans are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs 
over of our gulf south customers  including several of our largest customers  have declared bankruptcy due to the significant reductions in their revenues 
therefore  particularly with respect to our gulf south customers  we cannot assure you that the purchase of our medical products will not be limited or reduced or that we will be able to collect our receivables in a timely manner  if at all 
this may adversely affect our accounts receivable and future sales  earnings and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon sophisticated data processing systems which may impair our business operations if they fail to operate properly or as we anticipate 
the success of our business relies on our ability to i obtain  process  analyze and manage data and ii maintain and upgrade our data processing capabilities 
we rely on this capability because o we typically receive rebates from manufacturers when we sell certain products for our imaging business and need sophisticated systems to track and apply for such rebates  o we must convert data and information systems after acquisitions  o we must receive and process customer orders quickly  o we must ship orders on a timely basis  o we must manage the billing and collections  from over  customers  o we must manage the purchasing and distribution of over  inventory items from distribution centers  o we are processing approximately million of our revenues through the internet 
our business  financial conditions and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if  among other things o our data processing capabilities are interrupted or fail for any extended length of time  o we fail to upgrade our data services  o our data processing system is unable to support our expanded business  or o we lose or are unable to store data 
our rate of revenue growth will be adversely affected if we are unable to make future acquisitions 
if we are unable to make acquisitions  we may not meet our revenue growth expectations and our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
while we are not currently a party to any agreements or understandings for any material acquisitions  we expect to continue to acquire both domestic and foreign companies as part of our growth strategy 
however  we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
we compete with other companies to acquire businesses that distribute medical equipment and supplies to physicians  other alternate site providers  long term care providers  home care providers  and hospitals as well as other lines of business 
we expect this competition to continue to increase  making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
our strategy for growth may not result in additional revenue or operating income and may have an adverse effect on working capital and earnings 
a key component of our growth strategy is to increase sales to both existing and new customers  including large chains  independent operators and provider groups 
we intend to accomplish this by o expanding our e commerce initiatives and development  o adding one or more new strategic distribution centers  o expanding some existing distribution centers  o hiring additional direct sales or other personnel  and o increasing our national sales efforts 
we cannot assure you that these efforts will result in additional revenues or operating income 
we also anticipate continuing to grow through the opening of start up imaging and long term care service centers 
we anticipate these start ups to generally incur operating losses for approximately months 
this expansion  therefore  entails risks  including o an adverse effect on working capital and earnings during the expansion period  o the incurrence of significant indebtedness  and o significant losses from unsuccessful start ups 
as we continue to increase our sales to large chains and consolidating provider groups  we may face competitive pricing pressures 
we are expanding our business with large chains and consolidating provider groups  especially in the long term care market 
this may result in competitive pricing pressures 
our gross margins on these large group chains are to basis points lower than average due to o additional negotiating leverage of large chains  o vendor agreements containing volume discounts  o customer volume specifications  and o service specifications 
we depend heavily on our exclusive and semi exclusive distributorship agreements  the loss of any of which could reduce our revenues and earnings 
we distribute over  medical products manufactured by approximately  vendors 
we rely on these vendors for the manufacture and supply of products 
during the month period ended march   however  no vendor relationship accounted for more than  except for eastman kodak that accounted for less than  of pss inventory purchases 
one of our significant vendor contracts is with abbott laboratories 
abbott may terminate the contract if we do not meet certain sales levels 
we have  in the past  renegotiated such sales levels 
our other exclusive and semi exclusive distribution agreements include agreements for certain products manufactured by o abbott laboratories  inc o biosound o candela o hologic  inc o philips medical systems o siemens o sonosite o trex medical corporation our ability to maintain good relations with these vendors affects our profitability 
currently  pss relies on vendors to provide o field sales representatives technical and selling support  o agreeable purchasing and delivery terms  o sales performance incentives  o financial support of sales and marketing programs  and o promotional materials 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain good relations with our vendors 
most of these vendors have change of control provisions in their contracts which could be triggered by them if a pending transaction is approved 
our gulf south subsidiary depends on a limited number of large customers 
consolidation among long term care providers  including several national hospital and drug wholesale distributors and health care manufacturers  may result in a loss of large customers 
gulf south s business depends on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of its net sales 
as is customary in its industry  gulf south does not have long term contracts with its customers and sells on a purchase order basis only 
the loss of  or significant declines in  the level of purchases by one or more of these large customers would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
gulf south has experienced failure to collect accounts receivable from its largest customers  and continued adverse change in the financial condition of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operation  and liquidity 
we have grown and may continue to grow through the acquisition of medical products distributors 
these acquisitions may expose us to the following risks  among others o diversion of management s attention from the business of running pss  o the inability to integrate acquired companies information systems into our operations  o the assumption of liabilities  o amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  o entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  o the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  o an inability to manage changing business conditions  o an inability to implement and improve our central and reporting system  o an adverse affect on our liquidity  o dilution to our earnings per share before giving effect to certain expected potential cost savings and synergies  and o charges to earnings 
in addition  our systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support continuing extensions of our operations 
our operating results substantially depend on our ability to improve technical  administrative  financial control  and reporting systems of acquired businesses 
if we cannot integrate acquired companies with our business  our profitability may be adversely affected 
even though we may acquire additional companies in the future  we may be unable to successfully integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner 
integration of an acquired business is especially difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited or no expertise  or with a corporate culture different from ours 
if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses o we may incur substantial costs and delays  o we may experience other operational  technical or financial problems  o our management s attention and other resources may be diverted  and o our relationships with our key clients and employees may be damaged 
acquisitions may decrease our shareholders percentage ownership in pss and require us to incur additional debt 
we may issue equity securities in future acquisitions that could be dilutive to our shareholders 
we also may incur additional debt and amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible assets in future acquisitions 
this additional debt and amortization expense may reduce significantly our profitability and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may limit our flexibility to react to industry or economic conditions 
in october  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due the notes are governed by an indenture between pss  all of our domestic subsidiaries and suntrust bank  central florida  as trustee 
at march   our consolidated long term indebtedness was million under these notes 
for fiscal  we are scheduled to pay approximately million in principal and interest for our notes and capitalized leases 
in addition  we have a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for an additional million  of which million is outstanding as of march  if we default under any of our indebtedness  then we are deemed to be in default under the terms of the indenture and the credit agreement 
as a result of this increased leverage  our principal and interest obligations have increased significantly 
the level of its indebtedness could o limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  o limit our ability to make capital expenditures  o limit our acquisition activity  o limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and economic conditions in general  and o adversely affect our liquidity because a substantial portion of cash flow must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes 
we believe that our cash flow  together with available borrowings  is sufficient to allow us to meet operating expenses and service our debt requirements in the future 
our belief assumes  among other things  that we will successfully implement our business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business  liquidity  or capital requirements 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include the following options o reducing or delaying acquisitions and capital expenditures  o selling assets  o restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  and o seeking additional equity capital 
our indenture and credit facility may limit our ability to make acquisitions 
the financial covenants in our indenture and credit facility may restrict us from making certain acquisitions for the following reasons  among others o we must maintain a consolidated fixed coverage ratio of to or greater  o we must maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of to or less  and o we may only engage in businesses that we have previously engaged in or certain other reasonably related businesses 
we may not meet our debt covenants 
as of march   we were not in compliance with capital expenditure limits  the fixed change coverage ratio  and the leverage ratio under our credit facility 
we have obtained a waiver from our lending group for the period ending march  we believe it is probable that we will meet these covenants in future periods or that appropriate waivers will be obtained 
however  if we are not able to meet these covenants or obtain waivers  the lending group could call for repayment of our debt 
in addition  we would be in violation of the indenture 
the combined defaults would place severe liquidity pressure on the company 
we face litigation and liability exposure for existing and potential claims 
pss and certain of our current officers and directors are named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit entitled jack hirsch v 
pss world medical  inc  et al  civil action no 
cv j a 
the action  which was filed on or about may   is pending in the united states district court for the middle district of florida  jacksonville division 
an amended complaint was filed december  the plaintiff alleges  for himself and for a purported class of similarly situated stockholders who allegedly purchased pss stock between december  and may   that the defendants engaged in violations of certain provisions of the exchange act  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the allegations are based upon a decline in the pss stock price following announcement by pss in may regarding the gulf south merger which resulted in earnings below analyst s expectations 
the plaintiff seeks indeterminate damages  including costs and expenses 
we believe that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against the claims 
however  there can be no assurance that this litigation will be ultimately resolved on terms that are favorable to us 
although we do not manufacture products  the distribution of medical supplies and equipment entails inherent risks of product liability 
we are a party to various legal and administrative legal proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business 
however  to date we have not experienced any significant product liability claims and maintain product liability insurance coverage 
we need to retain the services of senior management 
our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  particularly our chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of such individuals may adversely affect our business 
because of our decentralized operating structure  we are also dependent upon the operations and sales managers for each of our service centers 
we need to hire and retain qualified sales representatives and service specialists to continue our sales growth 
in our experience  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers is dependent upon o hiring and developing new sales representatives  o adding  through acquisitions  established sales representatives whose existing customers become customers of pss  o retaining those sales representatives  and o hiring and retaining skilled service specialists in a tight market to maintain radiology and imaging equipment for our imaging business 
an inability to adequately hire or retain sales representatives or service specialists could limit our ability to expand our business and grow sales 
due to relationships developed between pss sales representatives and their customers  upon the departure of a sales representative  we face the risk of losing the representative s customers 
this is particularly a risk where the representative goes to work as a sales representative for a competitor 
we generally require our sales representatives and service specialists to execute a non competition agreement as a condition of employment 
we have not  however  obtained these agreements from some of these employees 
in addition  courts do not always uphold the terms of non competition agreements 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with other medical supply companies 
the medical supply distribution market is very competitive 
our principal competitors are the few full line and full service multi market medical distributors and direct manufacturers  most of which are national in scope 
many of these national companies o have sales representatives competing directly with us  o are substantially larger in size  and o have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
we also compete with o local dealers  o mail order firms 
most local dealers are privately owned and operate within limited product lines 
several of our mail order competitors distribute medical supplies on a national or regional basis 
continued consolidation within the health care industry may lead to increased competition 
consolidation within the health care industry has resulted in increased competition by large national distributors and drug wholesalers 
in response to competitive pressures  we have lowered and may continue to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase our market share 
these lower selling prices have resulted and may continue to result in lower gross margins 
we could face additional competition because o many of our products can be readily obtained by competitors from various suppliers  o competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market a product to our exclusion  o national hospital  drug wholesale distributors and health care manufacturers could begin focusing their efforts more directly on the long term care market  o hospitals forming alliances with long term care facilities to create integrated health care networks may look to hospital distributors and manufacturers to supply their long term care affiliates  o as provider networks are created through consolidation among physician provider groups  long term care facilities and other alternate site providers  purchasing decisions may shift to people with whom we have no selling relationship  and o we are increasingly focusing on national accounts where the purchasing decision may not be made by our traditional customers 
therefore  we cannot assure you o that we will be able to maintain our customer relationships in such circumstances  o that such provider consolidation will not result in reduced operating margins  or o that we will not face increased competition and significant pricing pressure in the future 
we face risks of managing and expanding operations in foreign countries 
through our worldmed international  inc subsidiary  we have acquired medical supply distributors serving physicians in belgium  france  germany  and luxembourg and plan to increase our presence in european markets 
as of march   we have directly invested approximately million in our european operations and have guaranteed approximately million in bank debt 
the expansion efforts in europe have slowed due to o internal competition for investment resources from our new imaging and long term care divisions  o language barriers to effective communication of business prospects and goals  and o development of key personnel necessary for expansion 
as we expand internationally  we will need to hire  train and retain qualified personnel in countries where language  cultural or regulatory impediments may exist 
we cannot assure you that vendors  physicians or other involved parties in foreign markets will accept our services and business practices 
the cost of medical care in many european countries is funded by the government  which may significantly impact spending budgets in certain markets 
international revenues are subject to inherent risks  including o political and economic instability  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o difficulties in accounts receivable collection  o fluctuating currency exchange rates  o costs associated with localizing service offerings in foreign countries  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o difficulties in the repatriation of earnings  and o burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices 
the continued development and growth of digital radiology equipment may adversely affect profits from our imaging business 
recently  certain manufacturers have developed digital radiology equipment that does not rely on film and film products 
film and film products constitute a substantial percentage of the products distributed by our imaging business 
we cannot assure you that the introduction and proliferation of digital radiology or other technological changes will not result in a material adverse change in the imaging business 
while we anticipate that we will distribute new imaging technology  we cannot assure you that we will obtain distribution agreements or develop vendor relationships to distribute such new technology 
in addition  we cannot assure that we would be able to distribute any such new technology profitably 
we maintain a significant investment in product inventory which exposes us to risks of product obsolescence or price decreases 
in order to provide prompt and complete service to our customers  we maintain a significant investment in product inventory at its warehouse locations 
although we closely monitor inventory exposure through inventory control procedures and policies  we cannot assure you that o such procedures and policies will continue to be effective  or o unforeseen product development or price changes will not occur 
in addition  we may assume inventory of distributors we acquire 
this inventory may include product lines or operating assets not normally carried or used by us 
these product lines or assets may o be difficult to sell  and o result in our writing off any such unsold inventory or unused assets in the future 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not adversely affect our business or results of operations 
the expansion of the two tiered pricing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
as a result of the non profit act of  the medical products industry is subject to a two tier pricing structure 
under this structure  certain institutions  originally limited to nonprofit hospitals  can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than pss 
the two tiered pricing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power demand more favorable pricing terms 
although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from our manufacturers  we cannot assure you that we can obtain such terms 
such a pricing structure  should it persist  may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our articles of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement and florida law may inhibit a takeover of pss 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may delay  deter or inhibit a future acquisition 
this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction 
our merger agreement and our proposed merger with fisher have been exempted from these provisions 
however  the merger agreement prohibits us from soliciting higher offers  places restrictions on our ability to respond to third party offers  and requires us to pay a significant fee in the event of the termination of the agreement due to another offer 
provisions that could delay  deter or inhibit offers include the following o a staggered board of directors  o the affiliated transaction statute  and o the control share acquisition statute 
in addition  the rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future and that may be senior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
on april   our board of directors approved a shareholder protection rights agreement which provides for one preferred stock purchase right in respect of each share of our common stock 
these rights become exercisable upon a person or group of affiliated persons acquiring or more of our then outstanding common stock by all persons other than an existing shareholder 
this rights agreement also could discourage bids for your shares of common stock at a premium and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of your shares
