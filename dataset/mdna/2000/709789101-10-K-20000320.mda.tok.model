item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements of peoples is presented to provide insight into management s assessment of the financial results 
peoples subsidiaries are the peoples banking and trust company  the first national bank of southeastern ohio first national bank  which also owns two insurance agency subsidiaries  peoples bank fsb  and northwest territory life insurance company  an arizona corporation that reinsures credit life and disability insurance issued to customers of peoples banking subsidiaries 
the peoples banking and trust company is chartered by the state of ohio and subject to regulation  supervision  and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the ohio division of banks 
first national is a member of the federal reserve system and subject to regulation  supervision  and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
peoples bank fsb is a member of the federal home loan bank  and is subject to regulation  supervision  and examination by the office of thrift supervision  and is also subject to limited regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
in the first quarter of  peoples announced plans to consolidate its three banking subsidiaries  the peoples banking and trust company  first national and peoples bank fsb  into a single national bank named peoples bank  national association  which will operate under the trade name peoples bank subsidiary bank consolidation 
the subsidiary bank consolidation  expected to be completed march   is contingent upon regulatory approval and other conditions 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the ratios and statistics contained elsewhere in this form k 
references will be found in this form k to transactions that have impacted or will impact peoples results of operations 
on april   peoples sold  through pebo capital trust i a newly formed subsidiary million of capital securities capital securities or trust preferred securities 
the proceeds were used by the trust to purchase  from peoples  junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due may  in late april   peoples invested million in the peoples banking and trust company peoples largest subsidiary bank 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of a portion of peoples outstanding common shares 
on april   peoples announced intentions to repurchase of peoples outstanding common shares or  shares from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions stock repurchase program 
the stock repurchase program was completed on december  the combination of the issuance of capital securities and the stock repurchase program has impacted and will continue to impact several key performance indicators of peoples future financial results 
the impact  where significant  is discussed in the applicable sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
on june   the peoples banking and trust company completed the purchase of four full service banking offices located in the communities of point pleasant two offices  new martinsville  and steelton  west virginia west virginia banking center acquisition from an unaffiliated institution 
in the transaction  the peoples banking and trust company assumed approximately million of deposits and purchased million in loans 
overview of the income statement peoples had increased net income of  or  to  in from  in diluted cash earnings per share for the year ended december   was  up or from in diluted cash earnings per share in cash earnings removes the after tax impact of intangible amortization expense 
return on tangible assets dropped to in compared to in return on tangible assets is defined as cash earnings as a percentage of average total assets minus goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
return on tangible equity improved to in compared to last year 
return on tangible equity is defined as cash earnings as a percentage of average total stockholders equity minus goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share reached in  up or compared to the previous year 
peoples core earnings increased due to strong net interest income and additional revenue streams associated with recent acquisitions 
return on average equity in totaled compared to in return on average assets was in compared to the previous year 
due primarily to earning asset growth  net interest income in increased  or to  the provision for loan losses in totaled  compared to  recorded in due largely to continued strong asset quality 
bolstered by growth in deposit account service charges  non interest income increased  or to  in  peoples reported net losses on securities transactions of  compared to net gains of  in non interest expense increased  or to  due to a combination of costs related to market expansion and acquisition  as well as interest expense from the issuance of the trust preferred securities recorded in other expenses 
peoples continues to grow through acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions 
while acquisitions using stock are continually evaluated  management is cognizant of not diluting shareholder ownership merely for the sake of growth 
management believes a comparative approach to financial reporting should include the discussion of cash earnings  which removes the after tax impact of the amortization of intangibles on peoples results of operations and facilitates comparison of peoples with competitors making acquisitions using pooling of interests accounting 
management uses cash earnings as one of several ways to evaluate the impact of acquisitions on profitability and peoples return on its investment 
recent acquisitions have increased and will modestly increase peoples amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangibles and as a result  the purchase method of accounting has affected earnings per share and other ratios 
return on tangible assets and return on tangible equity removes the after tax impact of intangible amortization expense and the balance sheet impact of average intangibles 
in  intangible amortization expense totaled   after taxes compared to   after taxes last year 
due to recent purchase acquisitions and related intangibles  average balance sheet intangibles increased to million in compared to million in interest income and expense net interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets include loans and investment securities 
interest bearing liabilities include interest bearing deposits  borrowed funds such as federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings and wholesale funding sources such as national market repurchase agreements 
net interest income remains the primary source of revenue for peoples 
changes in market interest rates  as well as adjustments in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  impact net interest income 
during the second quarter of  peoples initiated an asset growth strategy to offset the costs to service the trust preferred securities  thereby leveraging peoples increased regulatory capital levels leverage strategy 
the leverage strategy increased peoples earnings asset base approximately million and was funded primarily by fhlb borrowings and other wholesale funding sources 
the leverage strategy was implemented throughout the second quarter of and was completed on june  the leverage strategy and a full year s impact of earning asset growth that occurred through s west virginia banking center acquisition generated strong net interest income streams in increased operating earnings in can be attributed primarily to growth of peoples net interest income through the leverage strategy as well as strong internal loan growth 
net interest income grew to  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
total interest income reached  while interest expense totaled  included in interest income is  of tax exempt income from investments issued by and loans made to states and political subdivisions 
since these revenues are not taxed  it is more meaningful to analyze net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets and serves as a measurement of the net revenue stream generated by peoples balance sheet 
in  net interest margin was compared to s ratio of 
the fte yield on earning assets was in  compared to in the ratio of interest expense to earning assets decreased basis points to in net interest margin compressed slightly in due to the impact of the leverage strategy  which significantly increased peoples earning asset base in comparatively lower yielding assets such as mortgage backed investment securities and other investments 
net interest margin also faced downward pressure due to competitive pricing of loans and deposits in peoples markets 
through its leverage strategy  peoples increased net interest income by  of which  of the increase was attributable to volume increases  while declining rates offset interest income growth by  the compression of net interest margin was also the result of peoples increase in cash reserves during the fourth quarter in preparation for potential large yk cash withdrawals 
in order to fund yk cash reserves  peoples accessed various short term funding sources resulting in additional interest cost in the fourth quarter of  which decreased s net interest margin approximately basis points 
management anticipates net interest margin will decrease modestly in future periods due to continued intense competition for loans and deposits in peoples markets  as well as recent increases in the cost of funding sources from rises in interest rates 
management continues to analyze methods to redeploy peoples assets to an earning asset mix which will result in a net interest margin similar to peoples ratios before the leverage strategy was initiated 
loan growth continues to be strong and management anticipates that loan activity will remain strong in the near term future  which will enable peoples to shift a portion of its earning asset base to these higher yield assets as lower yielding investment securities mature 
average total earning assets totaled million in  a million or increase over average loans grew million or in and comprise the largest earning asset component on peoples balance sheet 
due to peoples leverage strategy and recent acquisitions  peoples average balances of investment securities increased million from million in to million in yield on earning assets totaled in  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in peoples earning asset yield is primarily attributable to the decrease in peoples loan portfolio yield  which dropped to in compared to in peoples investment portfolio yield remained stable  decreasing one basis point to in deposit costs  which comprise the largest dollar volume of interest bearing liabilities  decreased basis points to in due to lowering savings and time deposit rates 
the cost of borrowed funds also decreased  falling to in from in compared to  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in interest costs on peoples array of traditional interest bearing deposit products decreased basis points to in compared to the previous year 
the most significant component of interest expense in was interest paid on time deposits certificates of deposits and individual retirement accounts 
in  peoples paid interest of  or  on average time deposit balances of million 
in  the average rate paid was on average time deposit balances of million 
management expects deposit pricing to be increasingly competitive in and will continue to focus its efforts to increase balances in non interest bearing demand deposits  which grew  on average  million to million in average balances in in  peoples continued to use a combination of short term and long term borrowings as funding sources to fuel loan growth 
peoples cash management services offered to a variety of business customers have provided short term funding  specifically overnight repurchase agreements 
in  peoples average balances of these overnight repurchase agreements excluding balances of national repurchase agreements available through wholesale funding sources decreased million to million 
the average rate paid in on overnight repurchase agreements totaled  down basis points from the prior year s average rate of 
average overnight repurchase agreements comprised the largest component of peoples average short term borrowings 
during  peoples accessed national market repurchase agreements in effort to diversify peoples short term funding sources as well as take advantage of attractive short term financing rates 
peoples did not access this particular funding source in  while average national market repurchase agreements totaled million in at an average rate of 
peoples also continued to use short term fhlb advances as a source to fund its operations and investments during average short term fhlb balances decreased to million in  compared to million in  causing interest costs to decrease to  down from  last year 
in  the average interest rate on short term fhlb advances was compared to in management plans to maintain access to short term fhlb borrowings as an appropriate funding source 
long term borrowing costs  which represent the largest average volume of borrowed fund costs  decreased compared to the rate paid on average long term borrowings totaled in  down basis points compared to in the majority of peoples long term borrowings are fixed rate fhlb borrowings 
management plans to maintain access to long term fhlb borrowings as an appropriate funding source 
the growth of peoples earning asset base through the leverage strategy and recent acquisitions will continue to impact net interest margin in management expects interest rate pressures will continue to challenge peoples in as financial institutions and other competitors continue to search for new methods and products to satisfy increasing customer demand for higher yielding interest bearing deposits 
management will continue to monitor the effects of net interest margin on the performance of peoples 
provision for loan losses in  peoples recorded a provision for loan losses of  compared to s expense of  the provision is based upon management s continuing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and is reflective of the quality of the portfolio and overall management of the inherit credit risk 
management expects continued loan growth in and believes that future provision expense will modestly increase  dependent on loan delinquencies  portfolio risk  overall loan growth  and general economic conditions in peoples markets 
further discussion can be found later in this discussion under allowance for loan losses 
non interest income peoples non interest income is generated from four primary sources cost recovery fees related to deposit accounts  income derived from fiduciary activities  electronic banking revenues  and insurance commissions 
non interest income excluding securities transactions from operations reached new levels in  totaling  an increase of  or compared to all non interest income categories had strong growth compared to last year  reflecting management s focus on top line revenue enhancement as a primary source of cost recovery 
deposit account service charge income reached  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
in  deposit account service charge income was effected favorably by the full year s impact of the west virginia banking center acquisition and its associated million in deposits  which provided the base for associated increased fee income 
approximately  of peoples increase in deposit account service charge income for can be attributed to the deposits acquired in the west virginia banking center acquisition 
other increases in service charge income resulted from revisions in peoples fee structure in early peoples fee income generated from deposits is based on recovery of costs associated with services provided 
the fee structure for investment and fiduciary activities is based primarily on the market value of assets being managed  which totaled approximately million at year end  up approximately million from the previous year end 
due primarily to growth in market values and in the number of accounts served  income from fiduciary activities totaled  in  an increase of compared to peoples continues to build on its leadership position in its core markets and investment and fiduciary services will be a significant contributor to peoples non interest income streams 
electronic banking  including atm cards  direct deposit services  and debit card services  is one of the many product lines offered by peoples 
the fees associated with these products and services significantly impact peoples non interest income 
for the year ended december   electronic banking revenues totaled  an increase of  or compared to the same period last year 
these increases are due primarily to growth in the number of debit card users as well as corresponding volume increases in debit card usage 
management will continue to focus on electronic banking as a source of revenue as the financial services industry develops additional methods to provide electronic commerce 
in addition to traditional sources of non interest income  peoples also offers a complete line of insurance and investment products 
peoples product offerings include credit life and disability insurance  as well as life and property insurance to consumers in ohio and west virginia 
for the year ended december   commissions on insurance and securities generated revenues totaling  a  or increase over the prior year 
in the second quarter of  peoples named raymond james financial services  inc member nasd and sipc  an unaffiliated registered broker dealer  as its provider of improved services to peoples investment customers  including  but not limited to  asset management  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  portfolio evaluation  asset allocation  tax shelters  unit trusts  common preferred stocks  government securities  mutual funds  retirement planning  estate planning  tax exempt securities  annuities  and financial planning services 
management believes these services are integral to peoples relationship and needs based sales philosophy 
securities are offered exclusively through raymond james financial services  member nasd sipc  an independent broker dealer  located at many peoples sales offices 
investments and insurance products are not fdic insured  are not bank deposits  nor are they guaranteed by the financial institution  subject to risk and may lose value 
insurance products are underwritten by various insurance companies and are made available through licensed insurance agency affiliates of peoples 
management will continue to explore new methods of enhancing non interest income 
other traditional and non traditional financial service products are analyzed regularly for potential inclusion in peoples product mix 
gains losses on securities transactions for the year ended december   peoples reported net losses on securities transactions of   after taxes or per share compared to net gains on securities transactions of   after taxes  or per diluted share recorded in net losses on securities transactions in were primarily the result of peoples repositioning of the investment portfolio to improve the pledging capabilities for various deposit relationships of peoples investment securities 
for the year ended december   peoples had gains of  of which  related to an equity investment in a company that was acquired in a merger transaction 
peoples also reported losses on sales of securities of  from additional repositioning of the investment portfolio 
non interest expense for the year ended december   total non interest expense reached  up  or compared to when comparing non interest expense information to  it is important to consider that several categories within non interest expense were directly impacted by the west virginia banking center acquisition and related growth of non interest expenses such as salaries and benefits  depreciation expense  and intangible amortization 
in addition  non interest expense was impacted due to costs combination of debt service expenses and amortization of associated capitalized issuance costs associated with the trust preferred securities  which totaled  in non operational items caused a significant increase in non interest expense for the year ended december   in particular  amortization of intangibles totaled  an increase of compared to  recorded in the additional intangible asset amortization expense arising from the west virginia banking center acquisition was the primary reason for this increase 
compared to  salaries and benefits expense increased  or to  in  reflecting peoples continuing effort to expand both inside and outside its geographic markets 
acquisitions and new financial service center openings have increased the number of peoples employees  primarily those associates dedicated to customer service areas in the acquired offices and new offices recently opened by peoples 
at december   peoples had full time equivalent employees  compared to full time equivalent employees at december  management will continue to strive to find new ways of increasing efficiencies and leveraging its resources  effectively optimizing customer service and return to shareholders 
recent acquisitions and investments also impacted net occupancy expenses  in particular depreciation expense 
for the year ended december   furniture and equipment expenses totaled  up  or compared to net occupancy expense totaled  in  an increase of  or compared to the same period a year earlier 
these increases can be attributed primarily to the depreciation of the assets purchased in recent acquisitions  completion of financial service center remodeling projects specifically the three wal mart financial service centers opened to date and other banking center refurbishment  as well as increased depreciation of additional expenditures on technology 
peoples increased investment in technology and other customer service enhancements will also impact depreciation expense in the future 
in  peoples embarked on several educational sales programs designed to increase associates knowledge of relationship sales techniques and enhance peoples sales culture 
the educational programs are expected to continue in and have modestly increased non interest expense compared to previous periods 
management believes these types of investments in the future are necessary to remain competitive in the financial services industry and anticipates these programs will increase customer service associates perception and understanding of the relationship sales process 
maintaining acceptable levels of non interest expense and operating efficiency are key performance indicators for peoples in its strategic initiatives 
the financial services industry uses the efficiency ratio total non interest expense less amortization of intangibles and non recurring items as a percentage of the aggregate of fully tax equivalent net interest income and non interest income as a key indicator of performance 
gains and losses on sales of investment securities  as well as other nonrecurring charges  are not included in the calculation of peoples efficiency ratio 
in  peoples reported an efficiency ratio of  down from s 
peoples experienced a period of transition in due to the trust preferred securities issuance and the implementation of the leverage strategy 
as anticipated  these events coupled with increased operational costs  challenged peoples efficiency ratio 
management anticipates the efficiency ratio will stabilize in as peoples leverages non interest expense associated with market expansion  continues to shift earning assets to higher yielding assets such as loans  and refines its sales processes to increase customer satisfaction and revenues 
return on assets after removing the impact of intangibles and corresponding amortization  return on tangible assets decreased basis points to in compared to the previous year 
for the year ended december   return on average assets roa was  compared to in increased income streams from recent acquisitions were offset by amortization of intangibles assumed in such purchases  resulting in lower roa levels compared to previous periods 
additionally  the leverage strategy significantly increased the asset base of peoples in the second quarter of and caused a decrease in peoples tangible return on equity and roa 
management anticipates that roa will stabilize in peoples will be challenged to employ its asset base in a manner that will produce acceptable returns on investment 
assuming peoples is successful in transitioning the investments purchased in the leverage strategy to higher yielding loans  management expects roa to modestly improve 
management believes that recent changes to peoples balance sheet  particularly through the trust preferred securities issuance and leverage strategy  will shift peoples strategic focus on ratios such as return on tangible equity  return on equity  cash earnings per share  and earnings per share 
return on equity after removing the impact of intangibles and corresponding amortization  return on tangible equity increased to in compared to in peoples return on average stockholders equity roe was in compared to in using a portion of the proceeds from the trust preferred securities issuance to implement peoples stock repurchase program  roe was favorably impacted during with the reduction in the number of outstanding common shares 
with the implementation of the stock repurchase program  future enhancements to roe will depend on the timing of common share repurchases and the availability of peoples common shares 
management views the issuance of the trust preferred securities as an opportunity to leverage peoples equity position and expects continued roe improvement into peoples and its banking subsidiaries are considered well capitalized under regulatory and industry standards of risk based capital as discussed in note of the notes to peoples consolidated financial statements and such ratios were enhanced through the trust preferred securities issuance in income tax expense federal income taxes increased from  in to  in peoples effective tax rate for was  compared to in the modest decrease can be attributed to increases in tax exempt income compared to the prior year and investments in low income housing tax credits lihtc and lihtc pools  which reduce peoples tax burden and lower peoples effective tax rate 
management continues to explore methods in which to decrease peoples burden 
peoples has invested and plans to make additional investments in various tax credit pools over the next several years 
total investment in these tax credit pools is not expected to exceed million and is expected to benefit peoples future results of operations through reductions in peoples effective tax rate 
overview of the balance sheet peoples balance sheet at december   changed significantly in comparison to year end primarily due to the issuance of the trust preferred securities and the associated leverage strategy implemented during s second quarter 
assets totaled billion at december   up million or since year end due to the leverage strategy  the largest asset growth occurred in the investment securities portfolio  which totaled million at december   an increase of million or over year end compared to december   total loans increased million or to million  as growth continues to be strong in each of peoples loan categories 
total liabilities increased million or to million for the year ended december  this increase can be attributed primarily to the leverage strategy and the funding needs generated from its implementation as well as increases in short term borrowings to fund yk cash reserves 
long term borrowings increased to million at december   up million over year end short term borrowings increased million compared to year end  totaling million at december  peoples deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million in comparison to year end the april  issuance of the trust preferred securities is presented as guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in junior subordinated debentures 
peoples has classified the trust preferred securities as mezzanine equity on its balance sheet  net of issuance costs of approximately million 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in equity resulted from decreases in peoples net unrealized losses on available for sale securities  as well as the impact of the stock repurchase program 
at december   peoples had million of net unrealized losses on available for sale securities compared to million of unrealized gains on available for sale securities at december  at december   peoples had a treasury share balance of million  an million increase compared to year end due primarily to purchases under peoples stock repurchase plan 
other repurchases of peoples common shares during funded peoples stock benefit plans and a deferred compensation plan that permits peoples directors to acquire common shares through deferral of directors fees 
cash and cash equivalents peoples cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   an increase of million compared to year end at december   peoples held no federal funds sold compared to million at december   due to the allocation of liquid funds into peoples yk cash reserves 
normally  management directs liquid funds into higher yielding assets such as loans to meet loan demand in its markets  as well as enhance profitability 
management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents adequately serves peoples liquidity and performance needs 
total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate on a daily basis due to transactions in process and other liquidity needs 
management believes the liquidity needs of peoples are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents  readily available access to traditional and non traditional funding sources  and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year 
these sources of funds should enable peoples to meet cash obligations and off balance sheet commitments as they come due 
investment securities investment securities totaled million at year end  up million or compared to december  funds generated from the issuance of the trust preferred securities  as well as the leverage strategy  were used to purchase approximately million of additional investment securities during the second quarter of all of peoples investment securities are classified as available for sale 
management believes the available for sale classification provides flexibility for peoples in terms of selling securities as well as interest rate risk management opportunities 
at december   the amortized cost of peoples investment securities totaled million  resulting in unrealized depreciation in the investment portfolio of million and a corresponding decrease in peoples equity of million 
as a direct result of the leverage strategy  several categories of investments within the investment portfolio experienced significant growth 
investments in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies and corporations increased million to million at december  during the year ended december   investments in mortgage backed securities increased million to million  and now represent the largest segment of peoples investment securities portfolio 
peoples balances in investment obligations of states and political subdivisions totaled million at december   a decrease of million since december  corporate and other investments at december   totaled million  an increase of million over december  management anticipates continued modest reductions of investment securities in future periods as earning assets are deployed to higher yielding investments such as loans 
in the third quarter of  peoples sold approximately million of investment securities primarily tax exempt securities and reinvested approximately million  primarily in mortgage backed securities  while maintaining similar earning yields and approximate duration of the investment securities portfolio 
the repositioning provided peoples with additional securities that can be easily pledged as collateral  as well as increased peoples borrowing capacity 
management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through asset liability committee alco meetings 
the group also monitors net interest income  sets pricing guidelines  and manages interest rate risk for peoples 
through active balance sheet management and analysis of the investment securities portfolio  peoples maintains sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor requirements and the various credit needs of its customers 
management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable based on these parameters 
loans peoples lending is primarily focused in central and southeastern ohio  northern west virginia  and northeastern kentucky markets  and consists principally of retail lending  which includes single family residential mortgages and other consumer lending 
gross loans totaled million at december   an increase of million or since year end retail loan growth occurred primarily in peoples existing markets  while commercial lending growth also occurred to selected customers outside peoples primary markets 
peoples experienced significant loan growth during in commercial  financial  and agricultural loans commercial loans  which increased million or to million 
at december   commercial loans comprised of peoples total loan portfolio  comprising the largest portion of the loan portfolio 
economic conditions in peoples markets have provided quality credit opportunities  in particular  in southeastern and central ohio 
management will continue to focus on the enhancement and growth of the commercial loan portfolio while maintaining appropriate underwriting standards and risk price balance 
management expects commercial loan demand to continue to be strong into early in addition to the anticipated additional in market penetration  peoples will continue to selectively lend to customers outside its primary markets 
real estate loans to peoples retail customers including real estate construction loans account for the second largest portion of the loan portfolio  comprising of peoples total loan portfolio 
real estate mortgage loans totaled million at december   up million or since year end included in real estate loans are home equity credit lines equilines  which totaled million at december   compared to million at december  during  peoples offered a specially priced equiline product  to qualifying customers  which contributed to the equiline balance increase 
management believes the equiline loans are a competitive product with an acceptable return on investment after risk considerations 
residential real estate lending continues to represent a major focus of peoples lending due to the lower risk factors associated with this type of loan and the opportunity to provide additional products and services to these consumers at reasonable yields to peoples 
consumer lending continues to be a vital part of peoples core lending 
for the year ended december   consumer loan balances excluding credit card loans increased million or to million 
the majority of peoples consumer loans are in the indirect lending area  where volume increases were experienced  combined with slower indirect loan payoffs 
at december   peoples had indirect loan balances of million  compared to million at december  management is pleased with the performance and quality of peoples consumer loan portfolio  which can be attributed to peoples commitment to high level of customer service and the continued demand for indirect loans in the markets served by peoples 
lenders use a tiered pricing system that enables peoples to apply interest rates based on the corresponding risk associated with the indirect loan 
although consumer debt delinquency has increased in the financial services industry due mostly to credit card debt  management s actions to reinforce peoples pricing system and underwriting criteria have tempered indirect lending delinquencies 
management plans to continue its focus on the use of this tiered pricing system in the future  combined with controlled growth of the indirect lending portfolio if economic conditions remain strong 
peoples credit card balances at december   totaled million  down million or since year end while management continues to explore new opportunities to serve credit card customers  those plans do not include the assumption of additional unnecessary risk merely for the sake of growth 
loan concentration at december   commercial  financial  and agricultural loans comprised the largest component of the loan portfolio  representing million or of total loans 
at year end  real estate lending both mortgage and construction loans totaled million or of outstanding loans  compared to of outstanding loans at december  peoples lending is primarily focused in the local southeastern ohio market and contiguous mid ohio valley areas 
peoples loan mix of retail lending  which includes single family residential mortgages and other consumer loan products  is periodically reviewed for appropriate changes in mix 
peoples largest concentration of commercial loans is in credits to lodging and lodging related companies  which comprised approximately of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   compared to at year end these lending opportunities have arisen due to recent growth in the lodging industry as well as the need for additional travel related services in certain areas in or contiguous to peoples markets 
in addition  peoples was able to selectively lend to creditors outside its market areas  applying strict underwriting parameters to mitigate risk 
lodging and lodging related loan growth reflect peoples lenders ability to respond to the needs of customers in this segment of the economy based on financial  strength of the underlying credit and guarantor  and customer relationship parameters 
management believes peoples lodging and lodging related loans do not present more than the normal amount of risk assumed in other types of lending 
in addition to loans to lodging and lodging related companies  one of peoples larger groups of commercial loans consists of automobile dealer floor plans  which accounted for of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   compared to at year end allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio analysis on pages and of this form k presents in detail an analysis of peoples loan portfolio  the allowance for loan losses  loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan  and an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan type 
management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its loan review department and loan loss committee to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this formal analysis determines the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  allocation of the allowance among loan types and the adequacy of the unallocated component of the allowance 
the portion of the allowance allocated among the various loan types represents management s estimate of expected losses based upon specific allocations for individual lending relationships and historical loss experience for each category of loans 
the individual loan reviews are based upon specific qualitative and quantitative criteria  including the size of the loan and loan grades below a predetermined level 
the historical experience factor is based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets and industries  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
allowances for homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans  credit cards  personal loans  etc 
are collectively evaluated upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based upon management s assessment of qualitative risk factors that may not be evident in peoples historical experience  such as  but not limited to  changes in specific markets in both competition for loans and local economies 
this assessment involves a high degree of management judgment as well as higher amounts of uncertainty 
assessment of the adequacy of the allowance is a dynamic process that requires management to continually refine the process as markets  economic conditions  and the company change 
differences between actual loss experiences and estimated events are compared on a quarterly basis  allowing management to regularly modify loss provisions as deemed appropriate based on market conditions and other factors previously described 
the results of this analysis at december   indicate an increase in the amount allocated to the commercial category resulting from recent increases in peoples commercial loans outstanding 
the amount allocated to the remaining categories and the unallocated portion reflect the growth in the portfolios and changes in economic conditions 
management expects continued loan growth in and believes that future provision expense will modestly increase  dependent on loan delinquencies  portfolio risk  overall loan growth  and general economic conditions in peoples markets 
peoples consumer loan net chargeoffs continue to comprise the largest portion total net chargeoffs  reaching  in and accounting for of total net chargeoffs 
in comparison to  consumer loan net chargeoffs decreased  or due to decreased indirect and direct personal loan chargeoffs 
commercial loan net chargeoffs totaled  in  an increase of  over although commercial loan net chargeoffs in grew significantly higher in comparison to  management believes s results are more reflective of peoples historical commercial loan chargeoff experience 
credit card chargeoffs decreased  in comparison to  resulting in credit card net chargeoffs decrease to  in real estate loan net chargeoffs were insignificant in  demonstrating the quality of the portfolio 
nonperforming assets which include loans classified as nonaccrual  renegotiated loans  and other real estate owned as a percentage of outstanding loans were at december   compared to at december  nonaccrual loans and renegotiated loans totaled  and  respectively  at year end  compared to  and  respectively  at year end other real estate owned totaled  at year end compared to  at december  management believes the current level of nonperforming loans is below peer group levels and is a reflection of the overall quality of peoples loan portfolio 
management also evaluates peoples loan portfolio quality by monitoring the amount of loans past due days or more 
at december   loans past due days or more totaled  a decrease of  or compared to  at year end a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that peoples will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of potential impaired loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s historical effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  impairment loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
at december   peoples had an insignificant amount of loans that were considered impaired 
management will continue to monitor the status of impaired loans  including performing and non performing loans 
the allowance for loan losses is deemed to be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio at december  funding sources peoples considers a number of alternatives  including but not limited to deposits  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings when evaluating funding sources 
traditional deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for peoples  totaling million  or of peoples funding sources at december  non interest bearing deposits remain a core funding source for peoples 
at december   non interest bearing balances totaled million  a million or increase compared to year end management intends to continue to focus on maintaining its base of lower costing funding sources  through product offerings that benefit customers who increase their relationship with peoples by using multiple products and services 
interest bearing deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million or compared to year end on a percentage basis  interest bearing transaction accounts were the largest growth component of peoples deposits 
interest bearing transaction accounts averaged million in  a million or increase over s average 
in the first half of  peoples experienced attrition of maturing  short term certificates of deposit as rate sensitive customers looked to maximize their investments by comparing rates offered by peoples competitors 
in the second half of  peoples offset this attrition by offering a special month cd which offered an attractive rate of return 
in late  peoples replaced the month cd special with an attractive month cd special to lessen peoples short term interest rate sensitivity 
management will continue to emphasize deposit gathering in by offering special relationship accounts both non interest bearing and interest bearing based on other products and services offered by peoples 
management will also concentrate on balancing deposit growth with adequate net interest margin to meet peoples strategic goals 
along with traditional deposits  peoples accesses both short term and long term borrowings to fund its operations and investments 
peoples short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  corporate deposits held in overnight repurchase agreements  wholesale funds such as term repurchase agreements  and various fhlb borrowings 
at december   short term borrowings totaled million  an increase of million over year end increases in term repurchase agreements utilized in peoples leverage strategy and short term fhlb borrowings contributed to growth in peoples short term borrowings 
at the end of  peoples had total short term  national market repurchase agreement balances of million compared to no balance held at year end at december   short term  national market repurchase agreements comprised the largest component of peoples short term borrowings 
at december   peoples had million in short term fhlb advances compared to million advanced at year end short term fhlb advances and short term  national market repurchase agreements were accessed heavily at the end of to fund peoples yk cash reserves for potentially large customer deposit withdrawals 
in general  peoples accesses this funding source at various times to balance liquidity needs 
the second largest component of short term borrowings consisted of balances in corporate repurchase agreements  which totaled million at december   compared to million at year end management anticipates that corporate repurchase agreement balances will remain relatively stable in in addition to traditional deposits and short term borrowings  peoples maintains long term borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
long term fhlb advances totaled million at december   compared to million at year end in the second quarter of  peoples advanced million in long term fhlb borrowings to fund investment securities purchased in the leverage strategy 
the fhlb advances were primarily year borrowings  with fixed rate features for periods of two  three  or four years  depending on the specific advance 
each advance has the opportunity to reprice after its initial fixed rate period at the discretion of the fhlb  and peoples has the option to prepay any repriced advance without penalty  or allow the borrowing to reprice to a libor based  variable product 
management plans to maintain access to long term fhlb borrowings as an appropriate funding source 
peoples also has a long term note with an unaffiliated financial institution 
the original principal balance of the note was million and was used to finance an acquisition in early at december   the balance was million  a decrease of million since year end principal payments began in and continue semi annually over the next three years 
capital stockholders equity during the year ended december   stockholders equity decreased approximately million or to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from the stock repurchase program and increased net unrealized holding losses on available for sale securities 
in  peoples had net income of million and paid dividends of million  a dividend payout ratio of of earnings  compared to a ratio of in management believes recent dividends represent an acceptable payout ratio for peoples and anticipates similar payout ratios in future periods through quarterly dividends 
at december   the adjustment for the net unrealized holding loss on available for sale securities  net of deferred income taxes  totaled million  a change of million since year end since all the investment securities in peoples portfolio are classified as available for sale  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments 
the changes in market value of peoples investment portfolio directly impacted peoples stockholders equity 
management believes peoples capital continues to provide a strong base for profitable growth 
peoples has also complied with the standards of capital adequacy mandated by the banking industry 
bank regulators have established risk based capital requirements designed to measure capital adequacy 
risk based capital ratios reflect the relative risks of various assets banks hold in their portfolios 
a weight category of either lowest risk assets    or highest risk assets is assigned to each asset on the balance sheet 
detailed information concerning peoples risk based capital ratios can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   peoples and each of its banking subsidiaries risk based capital ratios were above the minimum standards for a well capitalized institution 
peoples risk based capital ratio of at december   is well above the well capitalized standard of 
peoples tier capital ratio of also exceeded the well capitalized minimum of 
the leverage ratio at year end was and was also above the well capitalized standard of 
in  peoples enhanced its risk based capital ratios through strategic leveraging of the its equity base 
peoples capital ratios provide quantitative data demonstrating the strength and future opportunities for use of peoples capital base 
management continues to evaluate risk based capital ratios and the capital position of peoples and each of its banking subsidiaries as part of its strategic decision process 
in april  peoples announced its stock repurchase program  under which it purchased  common shares adjusted for stock dividend issued march  during approximately of outstanding common shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions 
these common shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of per share adjusted for stock dividend issued march   totaling million 
on december   peoples announced intentions to repurchase of peoples outstanding common shares or  common shares from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions stock repurchase program 
the timing of the purchases and the actual number of common shares purchased have depended and will depend on market conditions 
the stock repurchase program will expire december  at february   peoples has purchased  shares under the stock repurchase program at a weighted average price of per share 
in june   peoples implemented a formal plan to purchase treasury shares for use in its stock option plans 
the formal plan serves as the basis for treasury purchases in anticipation of peoples projected stock option exercises and is based upon specific criteria related to market prices  as well as the number of common shares expected to be reissued under peoples stock option plans 
under the plan  peoples is currently authorized to repurchase  common shares each quarter 
during  peoples purchased  treasury shares at a weighted average price of per share  totaling million 
management expects to purchase similar share amounts in future quarters for use in its stock option plans 
future changes  if any  to peoples systematic share repurchase program may be necessary to respond to the number of common shares expected to be reissued for peoples stock option plans 
management intends to continue its systematic quarterly treasury share program 
peoples also maintains the peoples bancorp inc deferred compensation plan deferred compensation plan for the directors of peoples and its subsidiaries 
the deferred compensation plan is designed to recognize the value to peoples of the past and present service of its directors and encourage their continued service through implementation of a deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows directors to direct the fees earned for their services into deferred accounts that are either invested in peoples common shares or a time deposit  at the specific director s discretion at the time of entering the plan 
as a result and in accordance with accounting regulations  the account balances invested in peoples common shares are reported as treasury stock in peoples financial statements 
at december   the deferred compensation plan and its participants were entitled to million of peoples common shares  which is a reduction to the equity balance of peoples 
management does not expect the deferred compensation plan to have a material impact on future financial statements or results of operations of peoples 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the objective of peoples asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within peoples policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through management of peoples balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposure based on changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels  and customer preferences 
interest rate risk the most significant market risk resulting from peoples normal course of business  extending loans and accepting deposits  is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes which can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples management has charged the asset liability committee alco with the overall management of peoples and its subsidiary banks balance sheets and off balance sheet transactions related to the management of interest rate risk 
the alco strives to keep peoples focused on the future  anticipating and exploring alternatives  rather than simply reacting to change after the fact 
to this end  the alco has established an interest risk management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and controlling the level and amount of interest rate risk 
the objective of the interest rate risk policy is to encourage management to adhere to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovations necessary to meet the challenges of changing markets 
the ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity  and safety 
the alco relies on different methods of assessing interest rate risk including simulating net interest income  monitoring the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity or economic value of equity  and monitoring the difference or gap between maturing or rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
the alco places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of interest rate risk do to its dynamic measure 
by employing a simulation process that measures the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures and by establishing limits on changes in net income and net market value  the alco is better able to evaluate the possible risks associated with alternative strategies 
the simulation process starts with a base case simulation which represents projections of current balance sheet growth trends 
base case simulation results are prepared under a flat interest rate forecast and at least two alternative interest rate forecasts  one rising and one declining  assuming parallel yield curve shifts 
comparisons showing the earnings variance from the flat rate forecast illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet strategy 
when necessary  additional balance sheet strategies are developed and simulations prepared 
these additional simulations are run with the same interest rate forecasts used with the base case simulation and or using non parallel yield curve shifts 
the additional strategies are used to measure yield curve risk  prepayment risk  basis risk  and index lag risk inherent in the balance sheet 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case provide the alco with information concerning the risks associated with implementing the alternative strategies 
the results from model simulations are reviewed for indications of whether current interest rate risk strategies are accomplishing their goal and  if not  suggest alternative strategies that could 
the policy calls for periodic review by the alco of assumptions used in the modeling 
the alco feels that it is beneficial to monitor interest rate risk for both the short and long term 
therefore  to effectively evaluate results from model simulations  limits on changes in net interest income and the value of the balance sheet have been established 
to monitor the short term exposure irr  the alco has determined the earnings at risk of the bank shall not decrease more than from base case for each shift in interest rates 
to monitor the long term exposure irr  management has determined peoples economic value of equity should not be negatively impacted by more than when interest rates shift and when rates shift  respectively 
for an assessment of the current interest rate risk position  the alco reviews static gap measures for specific time periods focusing on one year cumulative gap 
based on historical trends and performance  the alco has determined that the ratio of the one year cumulative gap should be within of earning assets 
the following table is provided to show the earnings at risk and value at risk positions of peoples as of december  earnings and value at risk at december  dollars in thousands immediate estimated increase estimated interest rate change decrease in net increase decrease in in basis points interest income economic value of equity the interest risk analysis shows that peoples is slightly liability sensitive 
this means that downward moving interest favorably impact net interest income 
the analysis also shows that for all simulations and all scenarios  peoples is within the interest rate risk limits that alco has established in the policy 
peoples was within the policy limits at all measured points during the preceding year 
due to the fact that the alco has significantly changed the techniques and methodologies used  a comparison to the information reported last year is impractical 
however  historical information was used to generate a gap analysis with the assumptions similar to december  as of december  peoples was liability sensitive by of earning assets 
the gap ratio for december  was liability sensitive 
the change between year ends can be attributed to  in large part  short term funds secured for yk contingency funding 
in both instances the gap ratio was within the policy range 
liquidity maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity is a primary objective of the alco 
liquidity  as defined by the alco  is the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand  and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
it is peoples policy to manage liquidity so that there is no need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions 
the alco s policy for liquidity management sets limits on the net liquid position of peoples and the concentration of non core funding sources 
the main source of liquidity for peoples comes through deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided from cash generated from assets such as maturities  principal payments and income from loans and investment securities 
during the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities totaled million  while outflows from investing activity totaled million 
the majority of the increase in cash outflows from investing activities occurred as a result of peoples leverage strategy 
when appropriate  peoples takes advantage of external sources of funds such as advances from the fhlb  national market repurchase agreements  and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates which enables peoples to match funding with contractual maturity dates of assets 
securities in the investment portfolio that are available for sale can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity 
the net liquidity position of peoples is calculated by subtracting volatile liabilities  non core deposits and brokered funds  from liquid assets  short term investments and unpledged available for sale securities 
as of december  the net liquidity position of peoples was million or of total assets 
as of december   the net liquidity position of peoples was million or of total assets 
the change between year ends can be attributed to maturities in the investment portfolio used to fund loan growth 
the liquidity position as of year end was within peoples policy limit of of total assets 
the alco believes peoples has sufficient liquidity to meet current obligations to borrowers  depositors  debt holders  and others 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of peoples assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
therefore  they are not impacted by inflation in the same manner as companies in capital intensive industries 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
in banks  monetary assets typically exceed monetary liabilities and therefore  as prices have increased over the past year  financial institutions experienced a modest decline in the purchasing power of their assets 
outlook for financial data and performance ratios for the year ended december   represent the results of key strategic initiatives implemented during issuance of the trust preferred securities  initiation and completion of the leverage strategy and the stock repurchase program  combined to offer unique opportunities to peoples to capitalize on peoples financial strength 
with these recent strategic actions  management has enhanced several key performance indicators  in particular earnings per share and return on stockholders equity 
peoples future financial results will depend on the timing of stock repurchases under the stock repurchase plan and other factors  such as the interest rate environment  loan demand  and availability of reasonably priced funding sources 
management continues to refine strategic plans to produce enhanced future financial performance through a combination of external growth and a focus on internal strengths 
in addition  management has identified and will continue to analyze key performance indicators which quantitatively measure the relative performance of peoples compared to prior year results 
peoples successfully quelled any potential negative results of the much publicized yk issue  resulting from computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
peoples had no systems failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  and is able to process transactions and engage in normal business activities 
management believes its assessment and resulting remediation measures ensured yk compliance in regards to mission critical applications as well as peoples customers and major suppliers 
peoples expensed yk project costs as incurred 
the total out of pocket cost of the yk compliance project did not exceed  including human resource expense which is estimated to approximate between  to  although actual out of pocket expenses were less than anticipated  management increased the amount of internal human resource consumed by this project  offsetting the costs saved relative to purchases of hardware  software  and or consulting fees 
with the consolidation of peoples three banking subsidiaries into peoples bank  na  management will focus many efforts on the integration of peoples various sales processes  products  and services in the transition to a unified banking entity will enable peoples to focus on a marketing program based on establishing consistent brand awareness of peoples in its markets  as well as establishing the connection between customers and the many products and services offered by peoples 
while the consolidation is expected to provide long term enhancement to future shareholder return via added operating efficiencies  the primary focus of the consolidation is customer retention and market share growth through improved product and service convenience and availability 
the consolidation will place more of peoples associates in customer service positions and lessen the administrative duties experienced with three separate banking charters 
the consolidation also allows peoples customers to access all offices  atm s  and internet banking system  and connects the northeastern kentucky markets with contiguous oho and west virginia markets  providing enhanced synergies and customer service opportunities in the huntington  west virginia ashland  kentucky greater metropolitan area 
in and extending into  management has initiated multiple programs designed to enhance the sales expertise and relationship building skills of peoples customer service representatives 
these and other investments in customer service enhancements represent peoples strategic initiatives designed to increase current and potential customer relationships within peoples 
management will continue to invest in sales training and other professional expenses as peoples sales process evolves 
in addition to intensified sales and education efforts  on january   the peoples banking and trust company opened its third sales facility within a west virginia wal mart superstore in south parkersburg 
this new office will increase peoples visibility in the wood county  west virginia market and give peoples personal bankers better access to an increased number of shoppers compared to a traditional banking center 
the south parkersburg wal mart office complements peoples existing full service banking center in parkersburg and other nearby communities 
management is pleased with the early results of peoples new wal mart offices and is encouraged by the sales momentum generated in these offices 
continuing peoples emphasis on electronic product delivery and expanding delivery choices for peoples customers  the peoples banking and trust company began offering a fully integrated internet banking system internet banking system or peoples online connection in late peoples online connection allows customers to perform online transactions  pay bills  view account history  stop payment  open accounts  change address  reorder checks  purchase savings bonds and complete other financial transactions 
peoples online connection is an on line service that offers real time transaction capability and portability for the customer 
peoples intends to satisfy customer demand for internet banking in the markets it serves while providing a link to its history of needs based selling and community minded service 
peoples online connection acts as the conduit of financial information for many of peoples customers and is being offered in conjunction with peoples pc based cash management home banking product used primarily by commercial customers 
peoples will continue to strive to meet future customer service challenges through its wide array of delivery channels  using technology and traditional methods in the manner that best fits each customer 
management recognizes the importance of electronic financial services to its customer base and continues to focus efforts designed to enhance this process and allow customers almost unlimited banking products and services at their convenience 
in the future  management will continue to research alternative methods of enhancing revenue streams by reorganizing and revitalizing its sales management process 
areas of focus will include enhancement of non interest income streams  including asset management fees such as fiduciary fees  insurance revenues  etc  electronic banking revenues  low income housing tax credits  and other investments 
peoples bank  the resulting banking entity of the aforementioned consolidation  will continue to offer a wide array of banking products and services 
two new operating divisions will be created to allow associates to better focus on customer needs peoples investments will provide customer tailored solutions for fiduciary needs  investment alternatives  and other asset management capabilities  and peoples insurance will provide a full set of life  property and casualty insurance products and services 
mergers and acquisitions remain a viable strategic option for the continued growth of peoples operations and scope of customer service 
future acquisitions  if they occur  may not be limited to specific geographic location or proximity to current markets 
management will continue to focus its energies on review and research of possible mergers  consolidations  banking center purchases  or insurance agency acquisitions as a means of acquiring sales centers that complement existing company locations and sales strategies 
ultimately  acquisitions will depend upon financial service opportunities that complement peoples core competencies and strategic intent 
management considers mergers and acquisitions to be a viable method of enhancing peoples earnings potential and will continue to pursue appropriate business opportunities as they develop 
management continues to position peoples for the future of financial services without sacrificing a compatible focus on community based values 
since many products and services in the financial services industry are easily copied  peoples focus is to deliver these products and services better  faster  and more efficiently than competitors 
one of the driving forces of peoples is to create and maintain multiple product relationships with customers where peoples is our clients first choice for financial services by combining the financial products and delivery systems of tomorrow with today s service  convenience  and commitment to our communities 
peoples goal is to be a high performing community bank  focusing efforts to provide shareholders at least a annual return on their investment 
in and going forward  peoples will work to achieve these goals by growing the relationship of existing customers to optimize the client s full service connection  increasing market share in markets where peoples does not have significant presence  continuing to create a business environment where clients can access traditional banking products and services  investment services  and insurance products in the most convenient manner possible  working to create a model that identifies new ways to fill customers investment and insurance needs  and expanding peoples e commerce capabilities through peoples online connection 
management concentrates on several key performance indicators to measure and direct performance of peoples 
while past results are not an indication of future earnings  management believes peoples is poised to capitalize on its recent growth and initiatives to reposition peoples balance sheet through the combined impact of the issuance of the trust preferred securities  the leverage strategy  and stock repurchase program 
management believes that peoples can produce enhanced future performance levels through integrated sales techniques and commitment to the strategic initiatives outlined in this section  which are designed to enhance customer service and increase future shareholder value 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this form k which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the interest rate environment  the effect of federal and state banking and tax regulations  the effect of technological changes  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  and other risks detailed in peoples securities and exchange commission filings 
although management believe that the expectations in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of management s knowledge of peoples business and operations  it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these projections 
comparison of to peoples reported an increase in net income of  to  in from  in this increase in earnings provided basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to and in peoples core earnings increased due to stronger earnings in existing business units and additional revenue streams associated with business acquisitions 
for the year ended december   return on average assets was  compared to in increased income streams from business acquisitions were offset by amortization of intangibles assumed in such purchases  resulting in lower roa levels compared to previous periods 
in  return on stockholders equity declined to compared to in roe decreased in primarily due to issuance of approximately million of capital stock  shares for the purchase of gateway bancorp  inc in december  as a result  the increase in total equity had a significant impact on roe for the year ended december  total assets reached million at december   up million compared to year end asset growth can be attributed primarily to the assets and liabilities acquired in the west virginia banking center acquisition 
net cash received in the west virginia banking center acquisition was redeployed primarily into investment securities  which increased million or from year end to million at december  loan demand in peoples established markets  loans acquired through the west virginia banking center acquisition  and loans purchased from external sources combined to increase loan balances million or to million at year end loan growth occurred primarily in the commercial loan area 
peoples recorded net interest income of  in  an increase of compared to  as total interest income reached  and interest expense totaled  net interest margin decreased in to from in yield on earning assets totaled in  compared to the prior year 
a significant contributor to this decline was the decrease in peoples investment portfolio yield  which dropped basis points to in  reflecting the reinvestment of higher yielding  maturing investments into lower yielding instruments 
loan yields decreased to in compared to in compared to  cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in deposit costs decreased due to a combination of lowering time deposit rates  the acquisition of lower interest cost funding sources from the west virginia banking center acquisition  and the implementation of regional pricing in selected markets served by peoples 
loans continued to be the largest earning asset component for peoples
