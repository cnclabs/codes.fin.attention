item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a national senior living and health care services provider offering a broad range of care and services to seniors within a residential setting 
the company currently operates senior living communities in states with an aggregate capacity for approximately  residents 
the company currently owns communities  leases ten communities pursuant to long term leases  and manages communities pursuant to management agreements 
at december   the company s owned communities had a stabilized occupancy rate of  its leased communities had a stabilized occupancy rate of  and its managed communities had a stabilized occupancy rate of 
the company defines stabilized as a community or expansion thereof that has either achieved occupancy or been open at least months 
for the purposes of the following discussion  amounts for the year ended december  represent the sum of the results of operations of arclp for the period from january  through may  and the results of operations of the company for the period from may  through december  the company s strategy is to develop senior living networks in major metropolitan regions 
we have put together a portfolio of large retirement communities which provide some or all of independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing care 
then  in the same markets  we have been building or acquiring stand alone assisted living or skilled nursing residences as satellites to expand the continuum of housing and care into the market 
the company believes that this hub and satellite approach produces management efficiencies and market penetration by offering a range of senior living arrangements at various price levels 
the company s methods to develop senior living networks include i selective acquisitions of senior living communities  including continuing care retirement communities and assisted living residences  ii development of senior living communities  including special living units and programs for residents with alzheimer s and other forms of dementia  iii expansion of existing communities  and iv selective acquisition of other properties and businesses that are complementary to the company s operations and growth strategy 
the company acquired privately held freedom group inc fgi and certain entities affiliated with fgi and with its chairman in july the acquisition resulted in the ownership of three ccrcs and management of four additional ccrcs 
the company also acquired options to purchase two of the managed ccrcs 
additionally  the company entered into a development and management contract for  and acquired an option to purchase  one additional ccrc currently under development 
the consideration paid at closing was approximately million  including million of cash and  shares of the company s common stock valued at million 
the company paid an additional million for the purchase options and million as consideration for entering into the two management contracts 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
during the fourth quarter of  the company announced that  as a result of changes in the senior living industry environment  it would shift from filling out its senior living networks through development of new assisted living residences to selective acquisitions of existing communities within those networks 
the company believes that increases in construction costs  particularly in the high growth markets the company has targeted  and an expected increase in the number of existing properties available for acquisition currently makes acquisitions of existing communities a more attractive alternative than new development 
as a result of this decision  the company abandoned several planned and early stage projects currently in its development pipeline and suspended all new free standing assisted living development 
the company recorded asset impairment and contractual loss charges of approximately million during the quarter ended december  the company anticipates that it may enter into discussions to acquire the leasehold interests in up to ten assisted living communities that the company currently is developing or managing 
these communities represent the majority of the company s assisted living residences that were not yet open for business at the end of if successfully concluded  the acquisitions would likely occur in the second quarter of following completion of these acquisitions  the company will receive all of the revenues and incur all of the expenses associated with the operations of these communities  effective as of january  since each of these communities is either in the last stage of construction or recently opened  the company expects to incur significant start up and operating losses until the communities achieve break even occupancy levels 
the company is currently developing or constructing senior living communities with an aggregate capacity for approximately  residents with an estimated cost to complete and lease up of approximately million to million 
in addition  the company plans to expand six of its communities with an estimated cost to complete and lease up of approximately million 
the six current expansion projects will add capacity to accommodate approximately additional residents

the company did not have entrance fee amortization in approximately   and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  were attributable to private pay sources  with the balance attributable to medicare  including medicare related private co insurance 
the company s management agreements are generally for terms of three to years  but certain of such agreements may be canceled by the owner of the community  without cause  on three to six months notice 
pursuant to the management agreements  the company is generally responsible for providing management personnel  marketing  nursing  resident care and dietary services  accounting and data processing services  and other services for these communities at the owners expense  and receives a monthly fee for its services based either on a contractually fixed amount or a percentage of revenues or income 
two of the company s management agreements are for communities with aggregate resident capacity for approximately  residents and terms of twenty years  with two ten year renewals and include a purchase option for one of the communities 
the management fee for these two agreements is equal to all revenue from these two communities in excess of operating expenses and certain cash payments

certain communities provide housing and health care services through entrance fee agreements with residents 
under these agreements  residents pay an entrance fee upon entering into a lifecare contract 
the amount of the entrance fee varies depending on the resident s health care benefit election 
these agreements obligate the company to provide certain levels of future health care services to the resident for life 
the agreement terminates when the unit is vacated 
a portion of the fee is refundable to the resident or the resident s estate upon termination of the agreement 
the refundable amount is recorded by the company as refundable portion of life estate fees  a long term liability  until termination of the agreement 
the remainder of the fee is recorded as deferred life estate income and is amortized into revenue using the straight line method over the estimated remaining life expectancy of the resident  based upon annually adjusted actuarial projections 
additionally  under these agreements the residents pay a monthly service fee which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services 
they may also elect to obtain additional services  which are paid for on a monthly basis or as the services are received 
the company recognizes these additional fees as revenue on a monthly basis when earned 
the company also provides housing to residents at certain communities under an entrance fee agreement whereby the entrance fee is fully refundable to the resident or the resident s estate contingent upon the occupation of the unit by the next resident 
the resident also shares in a percentage  typically  of any appreciation in the entrance fee from the succeeding resident 
the entrance fee is recorded by the company as refundable portion of life estate fees and is amortized into revenue using the straight line method over years  the life of the buildings 
additionally  under these agreements the residents pay a monthly service fee  which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services 
they may also elect to obtain additional services  which are paid for on a monthly basis or as the services are received 
the company recognizes these additional fees as revenue on a monthly basis when earned 
if a resident terminates the agreement  they are required to continue to pay their monthly service fee for the lesser of one year or until the date of reoccupation of the unit 
the company provides development services to owners of senior living communities 
fees for these services are based upon a percentage of the total construction costs of the community 
development services revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method based upon the company s costs of providing such services
