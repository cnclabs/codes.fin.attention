general msc was incorporated in delaware in since its inception in  msc has been engaged in mechanical computer aided engineering mcae  including the development and marketing of software for use principally by engineers and designers in industry  research laboratories and universities 
msc s mcae solutions are intended to allow the design to manufacture team greater freedom to innovate design concepts  optimize complex solutions and exploit materials as a design variable 
in the current computer aided manufacturing environment  designs are simulated before manufacturing has begun 
mcae analysis is used to simulate the performance of a design before its physical manufacture  reducing the costly physical testing of prototypes and permitting a substantial increase in the number of design trade offs and design cycles 
mechanical simulation helps manufacturers design and build better products faster and more efficiently 
engineers use msc s simulation software worldwide in several industries  including aerospace  automotive  shipbuilding  consumer products and electronic packaging 
msc also provides strategic consulting services to customers to improve the integration and performance of their mcae technologies 
our principal software products include msc 
nastran  msc 
marc  msc 
dytran  msc 
patran and the msc 
working model product family 
msc 
nastran is a basic mcae analysis software program that determines a product s stresses and deformations 
msc 
marc is a non linear finite element analysis fea program that offers automated non linear analysis of contact problems commonly found in rubber or metal forming and many other applications 
msc 
dytran is for non linear analyses such as those found in impact scenarios 
msc 
patran is an interactive mcae environment that facilitates the use of geometric data from popular computer aided design cad systems such as catia  pro engineer and unigraphics in a variety of commercial analysis programs  including msc 
nastran 
msc 
working model provides mechanical simulation and virtual prototyping software for use in both professional engineering and design markets 
the mechanical solutions division markets all of msc s products and services internationally to aerospace  automotive and other industrial concerns  computer and electronics manufacturers and universities 
msc s strong reputation has earned it the business of many companies  including bmw  daimlerchrysler  fiat  gm  ford  nissan  toyota  boeing  airbus  lockheed martin  dupont  eastman kodak and motorola 
in addition to being a leader in providing high end engineering analysis technology  msc has moved to package its technology in lower priced offerings for multi disciplinary engineers that perform simulation on occasion and design engineers who need to verify design concepts 
the working knowledge division  created following the acquisition of kr in late december  offers products for this latter market mainly through a network of resellers 
msc is concentrating on becoming more internet focused by continuing to make its products web enabled and through the launch of a new division and web portal in march  engineering e 
com 
this division leverages the core strengths  competencies and infrastructure of msc to create an engineers marketplace on the web 
in january  the msc 
linux division was created to support linux products and services 
msc 
linux will leverage msc s strengths in software technology development  professional services  hardware and software partnerships 
the division will initially provide msc s global customer base with cost effective linux based applications of msc s current products and infrastructure 
products and services core software our core software products are designed to be world class in their own right  and they also function as platforms on which we build some of our aerospace and automotive specific software and services 
our core software consists of a complement of solvers linked to a pre and post processor msc 
patran 
these solvers are capable of simulating virtually any mechanical structural phenomena  ranging from msc s flagship general purpose linear based solver msc 
nastran to a dedicated non linear solver msc 
marc to a specialty non linear solver msc 
dytran 
future work will be undertaken to create seamless transitions between them 
in addition  msc will expand beyond the traditional uses of fea to move into manufacturing process simulation utilizing the capabilities of msc 
marc and msc 
dytran 
the governing principles for our core software are to provide enhanced engineering productivity  in terms of process task automation via dedicated environments  templates  and workflow managers  numerical and graphics performance  and overall ease of use  greater range of simulation  including loads analysis and kinematics  non linear effects  robust design including probabilistic analysis  manufacturing process simulation  and test correlation  increased modeling  manipulation  and analysis of assemblies  from geometry to full fea models to super elements substructures to matrices from analysis and test  continued commitment to data exchange standards such as ap  ap  and ap  and increased emphasis on advanced visualization techniques and dedicated results processing utilities 
solvers msc 
nastran  msc 
marc and msc 
dytran msc 
nastran is a descendant of nastran tm  a computer program owned by the united states government and leased to others 
msc has improved upon nastran tm since nastran tm was first released in and the current capabilities and scope of msc 
nastran are substantially greater than those of nastran tm 
msc has been selling msc 
nastran since pursuant to a agreement with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  msc acquired the perpetual rights to commercially use those elements of nastran tm which are embodied in msc 
nastran 
see intellectual property rights below 
however  certain of msc s competitors sell other variations of nastran tm 
msc 
nastran is based upon the finite element method fem of analysis 
with fem analysis  complex structures are divided into small elements  which form a finite element model  which is then subjected to computer analysis 
msc 
nastran is used to analyze structures in order to determine  among other things  their strength  safety and performance characteristics 
for example  in the aerospace industry  msc 
nastran is employed to determine the stress distribution in the major parts of an aircraft  such as engines  wings  fuselage and tail 
a computer analysis could be applied to improve the design of aircraft by suggesting the removal of material where stresses are low and the addition of material where stresses are high  while reducing the usage of physical prototypes and other testing 
with this knowledge  aircraft can be made both stronger and lighter 
the same principles have been applied to improve the design of jets  rockets  engines  automobiles  trucks  tires  ships  farm equipment  heavy industrial equipment  nuclear containment vessels  helicopters  spacecraft and other products and structures 
because msc 
nastran has been designed in a modular way  new features can be added and obsolete features replaced without disrupting the other modules of the system 
as a result  major changes in computer hardware have been systematically accommodated 
for example  the program has been adapted to be used on a variety of computer types  from supercomputers to personal computers 
msc believes that the continued development and maintenance of msc 
nastran  together with the modular design features of that program  have prevented  and will continue to prevent  its obsolescence  although no assurance can be given that future changes in hardware or breakthroughs in software design will not result in the obsolescence of the program 
version was released in october  with the main feature being support for distributed parallel processing for statics  normal modes  and frequency response analysis 
as an example  this feature now makes it possible for large automotive nvh jobs to be run during the workday  enabling this type of simulation to be an integral part of the design process 
material sensitivity was also added 
over the next two years  our emphasis will expand to include more non linear capabilities  utilizing msc 
marc technologies  which are needed for large  system type simulation 
selected capabilities from uai 
nastran and csar 
nastran will be merged into msc 
nastran  based on market needs 
some performance enhancements have already been merged in  with more to come 
msc 
marc is the newest addition to the msc suite of solvers  filling the gap between linear msc 
nastran and its non linear specialty msc 
dytran 
msc 
marc also has extensive distributed parallel processing capabilities  and it is world renowned for its contact algorithms and its extensive material library  both of which have found extensive use in the tire and rubber industries 
the msc 
dytran product is for highly non linear analyses such as those found in impact 
it uniquely combines fluid structure interaction to facilitate the simulation of tire hydroplaning and occupant safety airbag occupant interaction 
msc 
patran msc 
patran provides finite element modeling  analysis data integration  analysis simulation  and results evaluation capabilities to simulate product performance early in the design for manufacture process 
all of the functions of msc 
patran may be integrated  automated and tailored to the user s specific requirements using a powerful programming command language 
msc 
patran system provides three fundamental functions msc 
patran core software the core of the msc 
patran software enables the engineer to visualize the design  preprocess the design into a computer model for engineering analysis  and post process the results of the analysis into a graphical representation 
the software interfaces with many popular cad programs and many analysis packages such as msc 
nastran 
application modules through a series of modules that can be added to the core software  engineers can perform analysis on stress  thermal mechanisms and dynamics  fluid flow  solid modeling  and fatigue 
some of these application modules have been developed by third parties and are marketed under joint development or marketing agreements 
interfaces msc 
patran uses a series of interfaces that allow it to interact with programs developed by other companies in the cad mcae industry 
these interfaces either involve direct links into other software or translate data to and from other software so that it can be processed within msc 
patran 
msc 
mentat continues to be the pre and post processor for msc 
marc  and its features will eventually be merged into msc 
patran 
other core products other core products include msc 
fatigue for durability analysis  msc 
akusmod for internal acoustic modeling and analysis  and msc 
construct for topology and shape optimization 
in addition  msc has a variety of other products  none of which accounts for more than of msc s revenue  including msc 
supermodel  msc 
superforge and msc 
mvision 
msc 
working model the december acquisition of kr led to the msc 
working model suite of products for motion and visualization animation 
these products can be linked to mid range  solid modelers such as solid works  mechanical desktop and solid edge 
msc plans to extend their visualization capabilities to work with our core solvers 
during  msc introduced msc 
working model d  which combined msc 
working model motion with msc 
incheck 
msc 
working model motion is used to simulate motion such as falling and colliding objects  pistons or conveyor 
this simulation answers the question will it work msc 
incheck is used to simulate stress  deformation and vibration 
this simulation answers the question will it break these products run on microsoft windows based personal computers and are closely linked to desktop based cad programs such as solid works  mechanical desktop and solid edge 
services msc develops educational tools designed to train users of its products as an extension of its software business 
training seminars are conducted in local languages on a frequent basis at the msc institute of technology in costa mesa  california  at msc s offices worldwide  and at client sites 
msc also offers both its mechanical solutions and working knowledge products to schools and universities 
in addition  msc provides a broad range of engineering software consulting services 
a typical consulting assignment might include all or some of the following activities process advice and automation we work closely with our key customers to advise them on product development processes  enabling them to make better products in less time and for less cost 
we automate the advice by providing software systems that integrate our software with pdm  cad  test  and in house software 
the advice and automation moves simulation up front in the conceptual and detailed design phases to enable simulation to be performed by design engineers and to be an integral part of the product development process 
in many of our service engagements  we use the msc 
acumen toolkit to create design engineering workflow templates that capture and automate the engineering process  providing tremendous productivity gains 
engineering services we provide engineering analysis and design services to our existing software customers and to companies who do not use our software 
these are delivered to our current customers to provide analysis or design expertise that they may not have  and to augment their capabilities if they have a manpower shortage 
these services are provided to other companies who do not have any analysis or design professionals on staff  but who need these capabilities provided via outsourcing 
we deliver the expertise of over highly trained engineers who write  support  and use the msc software on a daily basis 
we have provided services to automotive  aerospace  biomedical  electronic packaging  petrochemical  nuclear  and consumer product manufacturers and suppliers 
in addition to analysis and design services before a product s manufacture  we have also investigated the cause of in service failures for a wide range of products 
automotive specific services automotive manufacturers and suppliers are increasing their use of engineering simulation early in the design process  to reduce dependence on physical testing  improving overall product quality  and reducing cost time to market 
our automotive specific services capabilities are in the areas of nvh noise  vibration  and harshness and durability 
we have successfully completed automotive services projects providing fees in excess of  including development of a custom system for cooper tire to integrate simulation  design  and test  helping to reduce tire development time by  funded enhancements to integrate msc 
ams with bmw s in house product design manufacturing pdm system  substantially reducing modeling time for full vehicle assemblies and spot weld modeling  durability process automation for navistar  and brake squeal analyses for several companies 
a major trend within automotive manufacturers is to move the development of components and subsystems to their first tier suppliers  providing significant services growth opportunities for us within the supply chain 
aerospace specific services aerospace manufacturers and suppliers are increasing their efficiency by utilizing simulation to improve product performance and reduce design costs 
simulation is an integral part of the aerospace design process and is used early and throughout the processes 
we are known for having a core competency in aerospace and our products are considered the industry standard 
as a result  msc s two main service opportunities are in the areas of custom software development and process automation 
a major opportunity for aerospace specific services is in supply chain integration  pushing design and certification responsibilities down the supply chain 
today  we believe that there is little supply chain optimization within the aerospace market  while it is generally recognized that such optimization is needed 
most aerospace oems and suppliers are struggling to implement such programs 
training services we provide custom and standard versions of live  web and video dvd courses and course materials joining the engineering fundamentals with msc product specific knowledge to enable customers to make more efficient use of our software 
we are the acknowledged leader in cae training  more than five times the expertise and size of our largest competitor 
in  we expect to deliver several new courses on video and dvd and via the web 
onsite support as an optional service  we provide onsite support for our software 
this pay as you go service enables our customers to receive a dedicated level of technical support  with company personnel becoming or adding to the in house experts 
software implementation implementation services are a combination of training  onsite support  and engineering services to install software at customer sites 
these are provided to new or existing software customers so they can make quick  effective use of new versions or new products 
custom software development  collaborative development  and porting we can customize our software in order to provide customer requested capabilities on a funded basis 
some of our major software capabilities including dynamic sensitivity and optimization  acoustics  and static aeroelasticity were developed as custom projects  and in we will do others 
in many cases  the projects are fully funded by the customer custom development  but there are cases we absorb part of the cost if there is a future commercial benefit collaborative development 
one type of custom development is funded porting  where the hardware provider pays us to port our software to their new hardware or to new versions of operating systems 
linux services a new services area for msc will be for porting to the linux operating system 
for linux  we will help our customers move from unix  configuring systems for them  porting their in house software  customizing the operating system for special needs  and training them 
we will also offer turn key systems that include computers  the operating system  and software ours and others 
the computers will range from single pcs or workstations to high performance clusters of multiple machines 
research and development msc continually expends significant amounts on the development and maintenance of its suite of mcae software products  as well as on new product research and development 
during the years ended december   and  gross research and development expenditures were approximately   and  respectively 
of the amounts expended    and  respectively  were included in software costs capitalized 
effective january   msc changed the estimated useful life of its capitalized software assets from three and four years to two and three years 
msc has always estimated the expected life of these assets based on the release cycle of its products 
msc believes that as software production cycles decrease  amortization periods should also decrease in order to coincide with each version s revenue stream 
msc made this change prospectively 
msc s development activities have historically involved adding new capabilities to its family of mcae programs or converting those programs for use on new computer platforms 
these activities are intended to prevent technological obsolescence and assure msc s clients the maximum flexibility in selecting computer hardware 
msc considers the feasibility  cost and the size of the market its software program for a particular computer when determining whether to undertake development activity to adapt the program for a particular computer 
maintenance of msc software products includes system integration  quality assurance testing  error correction  and modifications to accommodate changes to computer system software 
given the maturity of msc s software  most maintenance efforts stem from continuing new developments 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
msc has recently increased its expenditure for software development 
this increase resulted primarily from the acquisitions of marc  uai  csar and kr and changes within it s product management function in staffing and staff mix related to a strategic revision in product development activity 
this shift in strategy de emphasizes features upgrades for specific products and promotes the development of technologies and integrated software solutions for targeted customers 
msc s total development cost before software capitalization was of revenue for  which was consistent with management s target of of total annual revenues under the new strategy 
sales and marketing msc markets its products through advertising in trade publications  participation in industry trade shows and exhibits  training seminars conducted worldwide  its existing client base and through complementary marketing agreements with computer hardware manufacturers 
msc also uses its own dedicated sales force as well as value added resellers vars and the internet for domestic marketing 
foreign marketing is generally conducted in the same manner as marketing within the united states 
the basic licensing agreements are substantially the same 
prices for agreements originating with msc s german subsidiary are generally stated in german marks and agreements originating with msc s japanese subsidiary are generally stated in japanese yen 
agreements with customers are typically denominated in united states dollars 
the agreements stated in other foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations 
revenue policy msc provides a variety of licensing alternatives for the use of its software products 
msc s software products have been primarily offered on an annual non cancelable  pre paid license basis 
an annual non cancelable  pre paid license is set at a fixed rate for the period and provides for payment in advance of use 
prior to october   license revenue was recognized at the time of sale  while maintenance revenue  representing approximately of the revenue from a non cancelable  pre paid license  was recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
effective october   msc adopted the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  pursuant to which revenue will be recognized ratably over the life of the contract for a non cancelable  pre paid annual license 
in recent years  demand has also increased for paid up licenses for engineering software products 
a paid up license provides significant revenue at the original time of sale of the product  with smaller payments for maintenance following the time of sale 
the growth of paid up licenses creates higher earnings volatility since larger amounts of revenue are recognized at one time instead of over a period of time 
service revenue was less than of revenue for see note summary of significant accounting policies and business information of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to msc s revenue recognition policy 
sales and support offices msc maintains north american sales and client support offices in costa mesa  california  san mateo  california  palo alto  california  atlanta  georgia  dayton  ohio  southfield  michigan  lowell  massachusetts  and mount laurel  new jersey 
sales and or technical support representatives who have engineering backgrounds and experience using msc s products are staffed in these offices 
these representatives market msc s products  provide training in their use  respond to user support calls and provide solutions for mcae analysis throughout north america 
in addition  sales and support personnel work out of numerous home offices throughout the united states 
the los angeles office serves as msc s corporate headquarters and e commerce office 
msc will be relocating its costa mesa office to new office space nearby in the south coast metro area of orange county  california 
the earliest move in date is anticipated to be january msc s products are marketed  distributed and supported outside of north america through a network of foreign subsidiary offices 
msc s wholly owned european subsidiary  headquartered in munich  germany  manages msc s network of wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  italy  spain  france  norway  the netherlands  poland  and the czech republic 
other sales offices are located in greece  russia  hungary  belgium  romania  slovenia and turkey 
in the asia pacific region  sales and service are handled through msc s wholly owned subsidiary in tokyo  japan  with a branch office in osaka  japan  as well as other sales and services offices in korea  taiwan and the people s republic of china 
a foreign subsidiary office is also located in brazil 
representative arrangements are also utilized in several other european and asia pacific countries as well as in india  australia and parts of latin america 
post contract support client service is an integral aspect of msc s marketing program 
msc maintains toll free numbers and a hot line service for its clients 
msc has invested in advanced call center technology to improve its capabilities 
user manuals  training and quality assurance are also essential to msc s marketing program 
msc s user manuals are comprehensive and updated on a regular basis 
a staff of writers and editors manage the design  writing  editing and preparation of user manuals as well as of training materials and promotional literature 
msc conducts formal training for clients  ranging from three day introductory courses to intensive courses on specialized subjects for experienced users 
onsite courses for clients are provided for larger user organizations 
msc also hosts annual users conferences in the united states  europe  asia pacific  australia and latin america to gather data on client needs  new engineering applications  and new trends in computing technology 
customers msc s products are marketed internationally to clients from aerospace  automotive  other manufacturers and universities 
these categories of clients accounted for   and  respectively  of msc s revenues for for  foreign export sales accounted for approximately of gross revenues  most of which was attributable to europe and asia pacific 
the balance was attributable to canada and south america 
the operating margins derived from msc s foreign export sales do not materially differ from its domestic operations 
see notes taxes based on income and note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to msc s foreign operations 
no single customer accounted for more than of msc s consolidated revenues in backlog msc does not maintain backlog statistics for its products because software is generally available for delivery upon execution of a licensing agreement or contract 
backlog for consulting services work is currently not material

subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to msc or persons acting on its behalf are hereby expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this section of this report 
risk factors historical results of operations and financial position of msc are not necessarily indicative of future financial performance msc derives most of its revenue from selling software products and services to high end users of the product design markets 
our revenue growth and our ability to match spending levels with revenue growth rates will directly affect our future operating results 
historically  a significant portion of our revenue has been generated from shipments in the last month of a quarter 
in addition  higher volumes of orders have been experienced in the fourth quarter 
the concentration of orders makes projections of quarterly financial results difficult 
in addition  over of our revenue is derived from international markets and are denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be impacted by weakened general economic conditions in various parts of the world  differing technological advances or preferences  volatile foreign exchange rates  and government trade restrictions in any country in which we do business 
risk associated with expense management msc plans its operating expense levels  in part  on expected revenue growth 
our expense levels  however  are generally committed in advance and  in the near term  we are able to change only a relatively small portion of our expenses 
as a result  our ability to convert operating outlays into expected revenue growth at profitable margins will affect our future operating results 
if our future revenues are less than expected  our net income may be disproportionately affected since expenses are relatively fixed 
risks of competition the software industry is highly competitive 
the entire industry may experience pricing and margin pressure which could adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
our success depends on our ability to continue to develop  enhance and market new products to meet our customers sophisticated needs within competitive pricing structures and in a timely manner 
shortened product development cycles may impact product quality  performance  reliability  ease of use  functionality  breadth and integration 
our success also depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain technical and other key employees who are in great demand  protect the intellectual property rights of our products  and continue key relationships with product development partners 
some of our current and possible future competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  and some have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidation 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to dependence on core products we currently earn a significant portion of our revenues from sales and maintenance of a core group of analysis and design software derived primarily from our msc 
nastran and msc 
patran products 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of these core products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future performance will depend upon successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new products or enhanced versions of our existing products 
we can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in marketing our current products or any new or enhanced products that we may develop in the future

accounting changes in the fourth quarter of  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  modification of sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions which retained the restrictive definition of what qualified for vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for allocating a contract fee among the various elements of an arrangement 
vsoe must be known for all undelivered elements of an arrangement  such as post sales customer support pcs 
as permitted  msc adopted the provisions of sop effective october  and  accordingly  revenue on non cancelable and pre paid lease agreements is recognized monthly over the term of the agreement  beginning in the fourth quarter of  since the vsoe of fair value required under sop to allocate the contract fee to the undelivered pcs elements of the arrangements is not available 
this resulted in a decrease in revenues that otherwise would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of since only a portion of the revenues related to annual lease agreements was recognized 
the revenue reduction was  compared to the amount of revenue that would have been recognized under sop this revenue was recognized ratably  primarily over the first three quarters of future quarters will also reflect the deferral of revenue associated with non cancelable and pre paid annual lease arrangements entered into in those quarters under sop because sop does not permit restatements of prior periods and because there are annual license renewals in every month of the year  the entire effect of this change in revenue recognition was not fully recognized in reported revenue on a quarterly basis until the fourth quarter of the year will be the first reported year that will reflect a full twelve months of revenue under this method of revenue recognition for annual licenses 
asset impairment and restructuring msc has consistently followed the policy of capitalizing software development costs related to product development in accordance with the guidelines established under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
capitalized software costs are then amortized over a period of time expected useful life that is estimated to equate to the term during which meaningful revenue from the related product is expected to be recognized 
previously capitalized product development costs and projected revenues are reviewed quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established in sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
msc recognizes impairment losses on long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
accordingly  during the second quarter of  msc recognized non cash pre tax charges of  related to the write off of the net book value of certain previously capitalized software development costs and to provide for the remaining payments due 
theses costs were deemed impaired because they represented duplicate technologies from those acquired in the marc acquisition

business acquisitions acquisition of marc analysis research corporation on june   msc acquired all of the outstanding stock of marc  a software developer and supplier whose products include marc a non linear finite element analysis fea program for engineering structural analysis  mentat a graphical user interface for marc  and marc autoforge a simulation program for the bulk forging industry 
the aggregate fair value of the consideration paid to shareholders and holders of options of marc resulted in a purchase price valued at approximately  including approximately  in cash and a package of securities to the marc shareholders  including  principal amount of subordinated notes due in years  approximately  principal amount of subordinated notes due in two years   principal amount of msc s convertible subordinated debentures due august   and five year warrants to purchase  shares of msc s common stock at an exercise price of per share

the independent appraisal of the acquired business included  of purchased in process research and development  which was related to two products under development 
this valuation represents the ten year after tax cash flow of this in process technology using a discount rate of 
the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
accordingly  it was written off at the time of the acquisition 
the remaining purchase price was allocated as follows  to net tangible assets   to identified intangible assets including  of developed technology   to customer list   for trade name recognition  and  of assembled work force  and  to goodwill 
goodwill and identified intangibles are being amortized over years 
on the date of its acquisition  marc s technology was classified between core or developed technology and in process research and development 
three marc products that had been released were grouped under developed technology and two development projects under way were identified as in process research and development 
the completion of the two development projects was estimated to be and at the time of acquisition 
the technology assets were valued using a relief from royalty and discounted cash flow approach 
the concept of the relief from royalty approach is that the value of a technology is the avoided cost of licensing the technology from a third party that the company would otherwise incur if it did not own the technology in question 
these research and development valuations represent the ten year after tax cash flow of the technology using a discount rate of for developed technology and for in process research and development 
the discount rate is based upon marc s weighted average cost of capital wacc of 
this wacc was derived by considering various factors to quantify the risk above a risk free rate of return of approximately 
the discount rate selected for the in process research and development was determined to be higher due to the relatively higher risk of these cash flows 
in valuing both the developed technology and in process research and development  the initial focus was on the revenue contribution generated by each of the products 
revenue estimates were based on the following aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  individual product revenues  growth rates for related products  anticipated product development and introduction schedules  product sales cycles  and the estimated useful life of a product s underlying technology 
the aggregate product revenue amounts were estimated and segregated between the developed technology and each in process research and development project 
in valuing the developed technology  an after tax royalty rate of was combined with a after tax royalty rate attributable to the in process technology to arrive at the free cash flow of the developed technology 
this cash flow was then discounted to determine the value of the developed technology at the acquisition date 
in valuing the in process technology  an after tax royalty rate of was applied to the revenues associated with the technology and the resulting avoided royalty payments were discounted to determine the value of the technology 
percentage of completion factors  based on historical and planned future development expenditures  were applied to the unadjusted projected cash flows of the in process technologies 
management believes that msc is positioned to continue development of these marc products  integrate these and other marc products with existing msc products and expand msc s market share in the non linear market 
however  there is risk associated with the completion  marketing and integration of these marc products into msc 
there is no assurance that the in process technology will meet with either technological or commercial success 
the substantial or outright failure of this integration could adversely impact msc s financial condition

the discount rate is based upon kr s wacc of 
this wacc was derived by considering various factors to quantify the risk above a risk free rate of return of approximately 
the discount rate selected for the in process research and development was determined to be significantly higher than the wacc due to the fact that the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition 
in valuing kr s developed technology and in process research and development  the initial focus was on the revenue contribution generated by each of the products 
revenue estimates were made using the same principles as we used with respect to marc 
the aggregate product revenue amounts were estimated and segregated between the developed technology and in process research and development 
operating expenses were deducted from the revenue estimates to arrive at operating income 
operating expenses included cost of revenue  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses but no non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization 
certain adjustments were made to operating income to derive the after tax cash flow 
these adjustments included the calculation of an applicable tax expense and an appropriate charge for the use of contributory assets necessary to generate revenue and operating income associated with the subject intangible assets

company trends reorganization on february   msc announced a new organizational structure following a re evaluation of its business strategy 
msc will now emphasize the expansion of the software business into new markets and value added integration services 
the new structure is designed to better serve the existing customer base and at the same time address expanding growth opportunities 
msc believes that these changes to its organizational structure allow it to continue its leadership in the high end market and deliver tools and expertise to the mid range and desktop markets 
msc is concentrating on becoming more internet focused by continuing to make its products web enabled and through the launch of a new division and web portal  engineering e 
com 
this division leverages the core strengths  competencies and infrastructure of msc to create the engineers marketplace on the web 
msc 
visualnastran in march  msc announced the creation of msc 
visualnastran  which will be the overall name for all of it s software 
the new name will serve several functions it will leverage the nastran name  it will unify msc s current set of software into one integrated  scalable family of software to address simulation needs in several markets  it will finalize the integration of the working knowledge and marc software products into msc s product line  and it will provide a framework for the future direction of our software products 
we anticipate several benefits from this a logical structure that shows where all of its software fits and how they interrelate in function  intended market  and pricing  removing the confusion that currently exists when discussing our products  leveraging promotional efforts for all software from all divisions  and msc will be able to define a pricing structure that allows customers to move easily between our product families and find the right price functionality point 
there are four product families within msc 
visualnastran visualnastran enterprise software for dedicated analysts at major manufacturers to simulate a wide variety of mechanical conditions 
this family will include mechanical solutions core products nastran  patran  marc  dytran  mvision  and fatigue as well as the automotive and aerospace vertical applications 
this software will link to other enterprise software such as cad  pdm  test software  and other cae software 
visualnastran professional software for multi disciplinary engineers at large or small companies that perform simulation on occasion  though this is not their primary task 
this family will include our new ultima product  msc 
nastran for windows  and new integrated products whose functionality and ease of use will be targeted to these engineers 
visualnastran desktop software for design engineers at large or small companies who need to verify design concepts 
this family will include the current working knowledge products and others to be defined 
e 
visualnastran software from the other three families that runs across the web in an internet asp application services provider model that is similar to data centers 
the msc 
visualnastran framework provides a structure for positioning all of our software  current and future 
there will be some overlap in capabilities and price  and other families may be defined later 
operating pattern the change in year end to december and the adoption of sop in the fourth quarter of both had a significant effect on the operating pattern of msc 
the month of january has historically been the largest revenue month of the year with the highest volume of renewals 
having this month as the first accounting period versus the last accounting period allows management to better forecast the annual results 
under sop  msc is recognizing software lease revenue on a monthly basis over the term of the licenses 
this change has reduced the volatility of its revenue stream between interim accounting periods 
in addition  because the sop does not permit restatements of prior periods and because there are annual license renewals in every month of the year  the entire effect of this change in revenue recognition was not recognized in reported revenue on a quarterly basis until the fourth quarter of the year will be the first reported year that will reflect a full twelve months of revenue under this method of revenue recognition for annual licenses 
msc anticipates that revenue for will also be affected by having a full year of operations of marc and uai  which were acquired in june  and csar  which was acquired in november effective january   msc changed the estimated useful life of its capitalized software assets from three and four years to two and three years 
msc has always estimated the expected life of these assets based on the release cycle of its products 
msc believes that as software production cycles decrease  amortization periods should also decrease in order to coincide with a version s revenue stream 
msc made this change prospectively 
due to the continual change in the product development process  there can be no assurance that the level of development capitalized in future periods will be comparable to current capitalized levels 
therefore  the effect of this change is not determinable 
liquidity and capital resources working capital needed to finance msc s growth in the past has been provided by cash on hand  the sale of its marketable securities and cash flow from operations 
management believes that cash generated from operations and the unused portion of its line of credit will continue to provide sufficient capital for normal working capital needs in the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   msc s working capital was  compared to  at december  during  cash outlays were made of  in conjunction with the  of restructuring charges and acquisition costs recorded in and the remaining cash outlays are anticipated to be completed by the end of  excluding certain lease commitments that may continue into the year during  msc expended approximately  of cash in connection with the acquisitions of marc  uai and csar 
in late december  msc expended  of cash in connection with the acquisition of kr and silverado 
these acquisitions adversely affected msc s working capital position and cash reserves  and lowered its investment income 
msc does not expect to have significant amounts of investment income in the near future 
as of december   msc had a balance outstanding on a line of credit with its previous principal bank of  in may  this amount was repaid 
on august   msc entered into a new loan and security agreement loan agreement with its new principal bank the bank 
on october   msc and the bank amended the terms of the loan agreement 
the credit facility now includes a  revolving line of credit and an  term loan 
the amount of the line of credit available in excess of  is subject to a defined borrowing base of outstanding trade receivables 
as of december   the amount available under the line of credit  based on the defined borrowing base  was approximately  the term of the revolving portion of the loan agreement expires may  as of december   there was no balance outstanding on the line of credit and there were no borrowings from the line of credit during on november   msc borrowed  at the bank s prime rate in connection with the acquisition of csar 
the term of the loan is two years and requires monthly principal payments of  as of december   the balance on the loan was  all borrowings under the loan agreement carry an interest rate equal to the bank s prime lending rate or libor plus basis points 
borrowings under the loan agreement are secured by nearly all of company s goods and equipment  inventory  contract rights  and intellectual property rights 
borrowings also involve certain restrictive covenants  including restrictions on dividends and investments 
as of december   msc is in compliance with all covenants 
refer to note financial instruments 
msc issued  of convertible subordinated debentures in connection with the acquisition of pda engineering in an additional  principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures was issued  at a discount  in june in connection with the marc acquisition 
refer to note business acquisitions and divestitures 
the debentures bear interest at with interest payments due semi annually on march and september the conversion feature permits the holder to convert the debentures into shares of msc s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the debentures mature august   but are redeemable at msc s option at any time after august  upon payment of a premium 
at december   the balance of the convertible subordinated debentures  excluding unamortized discount of  was  management expects to continue to invest a substantial portion of msc s revenues in the development of new computer software technologies and products and the enhancement of certain existing products 
during and  msc expended a total of  and  respectively  on development efforts  of which  and  respectively  were capitalized 
product development costs and the capitalization rate may vary depending  in part  on the number of products and the stage of development of the products in process 
during and  msc acquired  and  respectively  of new property and equipment 
capital expenditures included upgrades in computer equipment in order to keep current with technological advances and upgrades of facilities worldwide 
msc s capital expenditures vary from year to year  as required by business needs 
msc intends to continue to expand the capabilities of its computer equipment used in the development and support of its proprietary software products 
management expects expenditures for property and equipment in and to be consistent with those for in  msc s board of directors authorized the repurchase of common stock in the open market for up to a total aggregate amount of  msc repurchased and retired approximately  of common stock in before this authorization was rescinded 
in june  the principal shareholders of lms international lms exercised a repurchase option for an equity position that msc had held in lms 
msc realized a pre tax gain of  lms is a privately held company based in leuven  belgium 
msc does not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  msc s loan agreement with its principal bank contains restrictions on the payment of dividends 
impact of year in prior years  msc discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  msc completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  msc experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the amount of money msc expended in in connection with remediating its systems was not material 
msc is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
msc will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies the legacy currencies and the euro currency  adopting the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between january  and january  during this transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis whereby recipients must accept euros or the legacy currency as offered by the payer 
a currency translation process known as triangulation dictates how legacy currencies are converted to the euro and other legacy currencies 
beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins and replace the legacy currencies as legal tender in cash transactions by july  because msc conducts a significant portion of its business in europe through its wholly owned german subsidiary  its business and operations will be affected by the euro conversion 
management is addressing the euro conversion  but its impact on future operating results is uncertain 
management expects the conversion to decrease pressure for pricing in legacy currencies in the participating countries 
however  it also does business in many non participating countries  including the united kingdom 
this could lead to an increase in cross border competition  which could affect its allocation of resources within europe  and eventually msc s labor cost 
msc is implementing an upgrade to its management information system which includes the ability to simultaneously record transactions in euros  perform the prescribed currency conversion computations and convert legacy currency amounts to euro 
the impact of the conversion on msc s currency risk and taxable income is not expected to be significant 
in regard to contracts denominated in legacy currencies  management has not identified any third party or customer contracts whose performance might be considered unenforceable due to a currency substitution 
software lease and maintenance contracts are typically renewed on an annual basis 
inflation inflation in recent years has not had a significant effect on msc s business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk msc is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk international revenues are of msc s total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from msc s two foreign sales subsidiaries in germany and japan and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
msc s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  msc s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
msc s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which cash from sales of it s foreign subsidiaries costs are transferred back to the united states 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
msc is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on msc in was not significant 
msc may enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated repayments of its intercompany debt with its foreign subsidiaries 
the forward exchange contracts do not qualify as a hedge for financial reporting purposes and  accordingly  unrealized gains or losses  based on the current forward foreign exchange rates  are reflected directly in income 
at december   msc had no such forward exchange contracts 
at december   msc had two forward exchange contracts maturing in january and february to exchange a total of  german marks for united states dollars in the amount of approximately  the unrealized gains were immaterial at december  interest rate risk msc s exposure to market rate risks for changes in interest rates relate to any borrowings under its line of credit 
refer to note financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
msc has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
msc invests its excess cash primarily in debt instruments of us municipalities and other high quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
msc protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk
