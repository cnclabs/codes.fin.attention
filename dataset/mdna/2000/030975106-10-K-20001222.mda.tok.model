item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis of results of operations the following analysis compares the partnership s results of operations for the year ended september  fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal and fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal 
fiscal compared with fiscal based upon national heating degree day information  temperatures in fiscal were warmer than normal and warmer than in fiscal retail volumes of propane sold were million gallons lower  primarily a result of the warmer weather s effect on residential heating gallons and a decline in agricultural gallons as a result of a poor crop drying season 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher motor fuel sales  reflecting the continuing effects of our expanding national accounts program  the volume impact of our growing grill cylinder exchange business  ppx r  and acquisition related volume increases 
total revenues from retail propane sales increased million in fiscal due to higher average selling prices 
the higher average selling prices resulted from significantly higher propane product costs 
wholesale propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase as a result of higher average wholesale prices and a million increase as a result of higher wholesale volumes sold 
nonpropane revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting higher customer fees  hauling  and ppx r cylinder sales revenue 
cost of sales increased million primarily as a result of the higher propane product costs and greater wholesale volumes sold 
total margin increased million in fiscal due to greater volumes sold to higher margin ppx r customers  slightly higher average retail unit margins  and an increase in total margin from customer fees and ancillary sales and services 
ebitda in fiscal was comparable to fiscal as the increases in total margin and higher other income were offset by higher operating expenses 
other income increased million due to  among other things  higher income from sales of assets and higher finance charge income 
operating expenses of the partnership were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal reflecting incremental expenses from growth and operational initiatives and higher vehicle fuel costs 
our growth and operational initiatives in fiscal included significantly expanding ppx r  acquiring retail propane businesses  and developing and implementing more efficient methods of operating the business 
although ebitda in fiscal was about equal to fiscal  operating income declined million reflecting higher ppx r and acquisition related charges for depreciation and amortization 
the partnership s interest expense increased million in fiscal to million primarily as a result of higher levels of long term debt outstanding and higher average bank credit agreement borrowings 
fiscal compared with fiscal based upon national weather data  temperatures in fiscal were warmer than normal and warmer than in fiscal retail volumes of propane sold were slightly lower in fiscal primarily as a result of a million decline in agricultural gallons as a dry autumn reduced demand for crop drying 
partially offsetting the decrease in agricultural gallons were higher motor fuel sales  increased gallons sold through ppx r and  notwithstanding the warmer weather  higher sales to our targeted residential customer market 
total revenues from retail propane sales declined million in fiscal primarily due to lower average selling prices 
the lower average selling prices resulted from lower propane product costs 
wholesale propane revenues declined million reflecting a million decrease as a result of lower average wholesale prices and a million decrease as a result of lower wholesale volumes sold 
nonpropane revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting higher appliance and cylinder sales  increased terminal and hauling revenues  and greater customer fee revenues 
cost of sales declined million primarily as a result of lower propane product costs 
total margin increased million in fiscal due to slightly higher average retail unit margin per gallon  greater total margin from ppx r  and an increase in total margin from appliance sales  customer fees and hauling and terminal revenue 
ebitda and operating income were higher in fiscal as a result of the higher total margin and higher other income 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
other income  net  in included a million loss from two interest rate protection agreements 
operating expenses of the partnership were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal are net of million of income from lower required accruals for environmental matters and million of income from lower required accruals for property taxes 
excluding the impact of these items in the prior year  operating expenses of the partnership increased million in fiscal principally due to expenses associated with new business initiatives 
interest expense in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the operating partnership s primary sources of cash since its formation in have been cash generated by operations  borrowings under its bank credit agreement  and the issuance of million of long term debt in fiscal and million of long term debt in fiscal on september   a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to  amerigas common units was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
in october  the partnership issued million of its registered common units in an underwritten public offering and received approximately million in cash proceeds  including related capital contributions from the general partner 
these proceeds were used to reduce bank credit agreement indebtedness and for working capital purposes 
the operating partnership s bank credit agreement  as amended  consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  and interest and distribution payments 
revolving credit facility loans were million at september  and million at september  the operating partnership may borrow under its acquisition facility to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets 
loans outstanding under the acquisition facility at september  and were million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  the bank credit agreement was amended to  among other things  extend the acquisition facility termination date to september  then outstanding borrowings under the acquisition facility will be due in their entirety on such date 
the operating partnership also has a credit agreement with the general partner to borrow up to million on an unsecured  subordinated basis  to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and interest and partnership distribution payments 
ugi has agreed to contribute up to million to the general partner to fund such borrowings 
during fiscal  the operating partnership issued million of series e first mortgage notes at an effective interest rate of 
the proceeds were used principally to reduce acquisition facility borrowings and million of maturing first mortgage note debt 
the partnership s management believes that cash flow from operations and bank credit agreement borrowings will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity needs in fiscal for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  including financial covenants and ratios  see note to consolidated financial statements 
partnership distributions since our formation in  we have paid the mqd on all limited partner units outstanding 
the amount of available cash needed annually to pay the mqd on all units and the general partner interests in fiscal  and was approximately million 
in fiscal  as a result of the additional common units issued in october  this amount will increase to approximately million 
one measure of the amount of cash available for distribution that is generated by the partnership can be determined by subtracting cash interest expense and capital expenditures needed to maintain operating capacity  from the partnership s ebitda 
distributable cash flow as calculated for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal is as follows year ended september  millions of dollars ebitda cash interest expense a maintenance capital expenditures distributable cash flow a interest expense adjusted for noncash items 
although distributable cash flow is a reasonable estimate of the amount of cash generated by the partnership  it does not reflect the impact of changes in working capital which can significantly affect cash available for distribution and it is not a measure of performance or financial condition under generally accepted accounting principles but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay the mqd 
although the levels of distributable cash flow in these years were less than the full mqd  borrowings in fiscal and fiscal  and cash generated from changes in working capital in fiscal  were more than sufficient to permit the partnership to declare and pay the full mqd 
the ability of the partnership to declare and pay the mqd on all units depends upon a number of factors 
these factors include the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintaining and increasing operating capacity  changes in operating working capital  and the partnership s ability to borrow under its bank credit agreement  to refinance maturing debt  and to increase its long term debt 
some of these factors are affected by conditions beyond our control including weather  competition in markets we serve  and the cost of propane 
conversion of subordinated units pursuant to the agreement of limited partnership of amerigas partners partnership agreement  a total of  subordinated units held by the general partner were converted to common units on may  because certain historical and projected cash generation based requirements were achieved as of march  the partnership s ability to attain the cash based performance and distribution requirements necessary to convert the remaining  subordinated units depends upon a number of factors  including highly seasonal operating results  changes in working capital  asset sales and debt refinancings 
due to significantly warmer than normal weather and the impact of higher propane product costs on working capital  we did not achieve the cash based performance requirements as of any relevant quarter through september  due to the historical look back provisions of the conversion test  the possibility is remote that the partnership will satisfy the cash based performance requirements for conversion any earlier than in respect of the quarter ending march  cash flows operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million lower than in the prior year 
cash flow from operating activities before considering changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decrease in operating cash flow in fiscal is primarily a result of higher cash interest expense resulting from higher average levels of debt outstanding 
investing activities 
in fiscal  we spent million in cash for property  plant and equipment including maintenance capital expenditures of million compared with million including maintenance capital expenditures of million in fiscal we acquired several propane businesses  including the west coast propane operations of all star gas corporation  for total cash consideration of million 
in fiscal  we made acquisitions totaling million 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions which we expect to finance from operating cash flows and bank credit agreement borrowings 
financing activities 
we paid the mqd on all common units and subordinated units  as well as the general partner interests  totaling million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net borrowings under our revolving credit facility were million in fiscal compared to net borrowings of million in fiscal during fiscal  the operating partnership borrowed million under the acquisition facility and made acquisition facility repayments totaling million 
acquisition facility repayments were made with proceeds from the issuance of million of series e first mortgage notes of the operating partnership 
the operating partnership also paid million of maturing first mortgage note debt during fiscal from such proceeds 
market risk disclosures our primary market risk exposures are market prices for propane and changes in interest rates 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs  and the partnership generally attempts to pass on increases in such costs to customers 
there is no assurance  however  that the partnership will be able to do so 
in order to manage a portion of our propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and derivative commodity instruments such as price swap and option contracts 
although we use derivative commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for trading purposes 
we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates on borrowings under the operating partnership s bank credit agreement 
this agreement has interest rates on borrowings that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september  and  borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowings under these agreements during fiscal and fiscal  an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
we also use fixed rate long term debt as a source of capital 
as these fixed rate long term debt issues mature  we intend to refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
on occasion  we enter into interest rate protection agreements to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of debt 
the following table summarizes the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivative instruments at september  and it also includes the change in fair value that would result if there were an adverse change in the market price of propane of cents a gallon and interest rates on ten year us treasury notes of basis points fair value change in fair value millions of dollars september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk we expect that any adverse changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains on the associated underlying transactions 
accounting principles not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas was amended in june by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas  which addressed a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure them at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
to the extent derivative instruments qualify and are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows associated with forecasted transactions  the effective portion of the gain or loss on such derivative instruments will generally be reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion  if any  will be reported in net income 
such amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into net income when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
to the extent derivative instruments qualify and are designated as hedges of changes in the fair value of an existing asset  liability or firm commitment  the gain or loss on the hedging instrument will be recognized currently in earnings along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk 
the partnership was required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective october  virtually all of the partnership s derivative instruments outstanding as of october  qualify and have been designated as hedging the variability in cash flows associated with forecasted transactions 
the adoption of sfas will result in a cumulative effect charge to net income of million and a cumulative effect increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
because the partnership s derivative instruments historically have been highly effective in hedging the exposure to changes in cash flows associated with forecasted purchases or sales of propane  changes in the fair value of propane inventories  and changes in the risk free rate of interest on anticipated issuances of long term debt  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our future results of operations 
although the partnership expects the derivative instruments it currently uses to hedge to continue to be highly effective  if they are deemed not highly effective in the future  or if the partnership uses derivative instruments that do not meet the stringent requirements for hedge accounting under sfas  our future earnings could reflect greater volatility 
additionally  if a cash flow hedge is discontinued because the original forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur  any gain or loss in accumulated comprehensive income associated with the hedged transaction will be immediately recognized in net income 
in order to comply with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
entitled revenue recognition sab  which is effective for the partnership on october   we will record a cumulative effect charge to net income of approximately million related to our method of recognizing revenue associated with nonrefundable tank fees largely for residential customers 
consistent with a number of its competitors in the propane industry  we receive nonrefundable fees for installed partnership owned tanks 
historically  such fees which are generally received annually were recorded as revenue when billed 
in accordance with sab  effective october   we will record such nonrefundable fees on a straight line basis over one year 
the adoption of sab is not expected to have a material impact on the partnership s future financial condition or results of operations 
also  during fiscal  the partnership plans to change its method of accounting for tank installation costs which are not billed to customers 
currently  all direct costs to install partnership owned tanks at a customer location are expensed as incurred 
we believe that these costs should now be capitalized and amortized over the period benefited 
on date of adoption  this change in accounting method will result in a cumulative effect increase to net income 
the partnership is in the process of evaluating the impact of such change on its financial condition and results of operations
