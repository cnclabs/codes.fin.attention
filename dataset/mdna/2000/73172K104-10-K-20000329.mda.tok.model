overview we were engaged principally in research and development from inception through september  when we began volume shipments of our first voice communication product  soundstation 
as of december   our voice communication product line consisted principally of the soundstation  soundstation ex  soundstation premier  soundstation premier ex  soundpoint and soundpoint pro 
in january  we completed the acquisition of viavideo communications  inc  viavideo  a development stage company that designed and developed high quality  low cost  easy to use  group video communication systems 
in february  we began customer shipments of the viewstation product family  our video communication equipment product line 
as of december   our video communication product line consisted principally of the viewstation  viewstation  viewstation v  viewstation mp viewstation sp  streamstation  webstation  showstation ip and the meetingsite in december  we acquired atlas communication engines  inc atlas  a privately held  oem supplier of integrated access devices iads and emerging supplier of digital subscriber line dsl routers 
atlas s line of iads and dsl routers  which will become our network access product line  provides voice and data over the rapidly growing dsl network 
through december   we derived a majority of our net revenues from sales of our viewstation and soundstation products 
although the iad and dsl routers are expected to become an increasingly important revenue contributor  we anticipate that the viewstation and soundstation product lines will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues at least through the year ending december  any factor adversely affecting the demand or supply for these products would harm our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition costs total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net other expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues total net revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase was due in large part to revenues from the video communication products 
this product line began shipping in february of and polycom has added various models since that time 
additionally  voice communication product line sales volume increases also contributed to the revenue growth 
further  while a majority of the growth was in north america  we also saw growth in europe due to our increase in investment in this region in total net revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase was due in large part to revenues from the video communication products which were not part of the prior year revenue stream 
additionally  voice communication product line sales volume increases  primarily in north america  also contributed to the revenue growth 
further  in we recorded million in revenue relating to a joint development and marketing agreement with m concerning the viewstation product line 
this m revenue compares with the million in revenue associated with a joint development and marketing agreement with m concerning the showstation ip 
in  and  we derived a substantial majority of our net revenues from sales of our video communication and voice communication products 
lucent technologies accounted for  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
no other customer or reseller accounted for more than of our net revenues during these periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for business segment information 
international net revenues revenues outside of north america accounted for  and of total net revenues for   and  respectively see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we invested greater resources in europe over which helped drive volumes and revenues up as a percentage of our revenue 
within europe  video revenues were the main driver of the increase 
in addition  asia also increased as a percentage of our net revenue 
in  volume increases in all international regions  primarily europe  contributed to the increase in the percentage of international revenue over we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net revenues for the foreseeable future  and we plan to continue our expansion in europe and asia in international sales  however  are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
additionally  international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in the future as we introduce new products  since we expect to initially introduce such products in north america and also because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
additionally  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales has been denominated in us currency  however  if international sales were denominated in local currencies in the future  these transactions would be subject to currency fluctuation risks 
further  beginning january   the participating member countries of the european union agreed to adopt the european currency unit the euro as the common legal currency 
on that same date they established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the establishment of the euro has not had any significant impact on us to date and should not in the future since a substantial majority of our international sales are denominated in us currency 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs including material and direct labor  polycom s manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense and an allocation of overhead expenses 
the cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was in compared to in and in the improvement in cost over is attributable to a more favorable product mix as more shipments of the higher margin video products occurred  and favorable material price improvements 
these decreases were offset by a write down of showstation ip inventory and the soundpoint inventory to net realizable value and reduced revenue received under a joint development and marketing agreement with m concerning the viewstation which had very low associated costs 
we received million in revenue under this agreement in compared to million in the margin improvement in over is attributable to a more favorable product mix  royalty revenues with no associated costs  favorable material price improvements and favorable manufacturing variances related to increased production levels 
forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult 
while we expect that the overall cost of net revenues percentage will be within a few percentage points of the current level  there are a number of risks associated with maintaining our current gross margin levels 
for example  uncertainties surrounding competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty costs  and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of net revenues percentage to fluctuate significantly 
additionally  the iad and dsl equipment products  voice over ip voip products and other desktop products have a significantly higher cost of net revenue percentage than viewstation and soundstation product lines 
if the iad  dsl  voip and other desktop products grow to be become a significant revenue stream  this will have a negative effect on the future cost of revenue percentages 
also  we may reduce prices on our products in the future for competitive reasons or to stimulate demand which could increase our cost of net revenues percentage  however  these possible price reductions may not offset competitive pressures or stimulate demand 
in addition  costs variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  such as the viewstation and viewstation fx or any other new product  could occur which would increase our cost of net revenues percentage 
further  gross margins associated with the showstation ip  viewstation sp and the soundpoint pro are lower than the targeted gross margins of the total product portfolio  yet the gross margins for the webstation are closer to the targeted gross margins 
the contribution of these products can have a significant impact on our overall gross margins 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  the cost of net revenues percentage may increase due to a change in the mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
we had realized lower cost of net revenue percentages on our direct sales than on sales through indirect channels 
now that we no longer sell our products through a direct sales force  profit margins will be negatively impacted 
sales and marketing expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  an allocation of overhead expenses and customer service and support costs 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in over was primarily related to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for the video and voice products 
additionally  an increase in the investment in the worldwide sales effort and the resulting staff increases also contributed to the increase over the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in over was primarily related to increased investment in the video communication sales effort 
as mentioned previously  we only began selling the viewstation products in and  consequently  had little sales and marketing expense in associated with these products 
additionally  increases in the voice communication sales efforts in have also contributed to the overall increase over we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts in an effort to expand north american and international markets  market new products and establish and expand distribution channels 
in particular  our acquisition of atlas communication engines  inc expands our product portfolio into the dsl access market which will require significant additional marketing expenditures to communicate the value of our new product offerings as well as significant additional sales expenditures to develop a new sales organization for this market 
in addition  due to the innovative nature of the viewstation  streamstation  webstation and showstation ip products  we believe we will incur additional expenses for sales and marketing  especially advertising  to educate potential customers as to the desirability of these products over competing products 
in addition  we will further invest in the european and asian markets  thereby  increasing the absolute dollars spent in this area 
also  the launch of the streamstation product  a product that streams point to point or multipoint video communications using the viewstation to the web  as well as voip and other potential desktop products  will cause an increase in our sales and marketing expenses 
additionally  this video streaming market is new for us and significant investments may need to be made to become successful 
further  we are currently expanding the service organization to provide expanded and improved support for its products which will increase our sales and marketing expenses 
research and development expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  consulting fees  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expense 
the research and development expense increased in over due to increases in the network access  video and voice product lines 
the expense decrease in when compared to was primarily attributable to higher development expenses for the showstation ip and viewstation products in which resulted in the initial launch of these products in early for the remainder of  the development charges for these products normalized 
these decreases were offset somewhat by increases related to the voice communication product line 
in all years presented  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our success and we are committed to continuing a high level of research and development 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives such as voip and desktop products will require significant research and development spending 
consequently  we intend to increase research and development expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in the future 
however  due to the extremely competitive hiring market in the high technology industries  we may not be able to find or hire qualified personnel in a timely manner or at all 
in fact  we established a development office in boston  ma 
in in an attempt to broaden our recruiting of top technical talent 
general and administrative expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  an allocation of overhead expense  bad debt write offs  legal expenses and accounting expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in over is due to increased staffing and infrastructure costs to support polycom s growth including the conversion of the management information system 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in when compared to is due to lower legal expenses associated with the vtel and datapoint lawsuits 
this decrease was offset by increases related to increased staffing and infrastructure to support our growth 
additionally  during the third quarter of  we reversed a contingency reserve associated with the datapoint litigation which was resolved favorably during that quarter 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff and costs related to supporting a larger company 
these additional charges include expenses related to a new information system  a new tax deferral strategy and infrastructure charges related to the significant investments being made in europe and asia 
additionally  write offs associated with bad debt are difficult to predict and material write offs could negatively affect the profitability in the quarter they are realized 
acquisition costs we incurred expenses totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  these costs were related to the acquisition of atlas in december in and  the cost incurred were related to the acquisition of viavideo 
a significant portion of these charges for both acquisitions were for outside legal  accounting and financial advisory services 
we do not anticipate any further material acquisition related expenses associated with either of these acquisitions  however  there can be no assurances that other expenses related to these or other acquisitions will not be incurred or  if incurred  will not be material 
other income and expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
interest expense is from our bank debt facilities 
interest income  net of interest expense was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the fluctuations in interest income  net are due primarily to changes in average cash and investment balances throughout the year 
provision for income taxes in  and  the provision for income taxes was million  million and million  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in and were primarily for state  federal alternative minimum and certain foreign taxes 
the increase in income taxes for is due to increased profitability 
the valuation allowance established in prior years was reversed in due to our belief that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
as of december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryforwards as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year prior to the year  many currently installed computer systems and software products were coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these code fields needed to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from those beginning with 
as a result  computer systems and or software products used by many companies needed to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
in anticipation of this issue  we expended resources to review our internal use software in order to identify and modify those systems that were not year compliant 
in addition  our products and services were reviewed and certified to be year compliant 
further  we also initiated a project to replace our current internal business information system in while this effort addressed the year issues of the legacy system  this internal system implementation effort was principally being conducted to improve operating efficiencies 
the costs associated with this effort were immaterial yet incremental to our operations and also represented a reallocation of existing resources 
these costs were expensed as incurred and were funded through cash generated from operations 
we have not experienced a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to year compliance issues 
in addition  to date  no significant projects have been delayed due to the year project 
liquidity and capital resources for the three years ended december  as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
additionally  we established a million line of credit with a bank 
the line of credit facility contains provisions that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and profitability requirements 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million and million and used cash in operating activities of million for the years ended   and  respectively 
the improvement in cash from operating activities in over was due primarily to the improvement in net income before non cash items  an increase in accounts and taxes payable and a smaller increase in inventories  offset somewhat by the growth in receivables and deferred taxes 
the improvement in cash from operating activities in over was due primarily to the improvement in net income before non cash items and a reduction in non trade receivables  offset somewhat by the growth in receivables and inventory and a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million in proceeds from an exercise of warrants by m  and million from the issuance of stock associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the primary uses of cash during were net purchases of investments of million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of positive net income before considering non cash expenses such as depreciation and higher total current liabilities including accounts payable and taxes payable  offset by an increase in accounts receivable  deferred taxes and inventory 
our material commitments consist of obligations under our operating leases 
we also maintains  from time to time  commercial letters of credit as payments for the importation of certain products 
the amounts do not exceed  and are outstanding less than days 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  investments and bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements through at least december  however  it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty how successful we will be at growing the market for our products  if at all 
if there is substantial growth and  as a result  we go beyond current acceptable liquidity levels  or if the financial results were to violate the financial covenants of the bank line of credit  we may require or desire additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions or competitive reasons  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to polycom and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas established methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities  and is effective for the fiscal years beginning after june   as amended by sfas no 
we believe that adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the effective date of this pronouncement is the second quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december  we believe that adopting sab will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
other factors affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this form k report  including our financial statements and related notes 
channel sales and inventory 
we sell a significant amount of our products to distributors and resellers which maintain their own inventory of products for sale to dealers and end users 
a substantial percentage of the total products sold during a particular quarter consist of distributor stocking orders 
we typically provide special cost or early payment incentives for distributors to purchase the minimum or more than the minimum quantities required under their agreements with us 
if these resellers are unable to sell through an adequate amount of their inventory  as determined by these resellers  of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if resellers decide to decrease their inventories  it would negatively affect the volume of our sales to these resellers in the current or future quarters and also negatively affect our total revenues 
also  if we choose to eliminate or reduce stocking incentive programs  quarterly revenue may be lower than historical levels or under the capital market expectations 
our revenue estimates are based largely on the sell through reporting that the resellers provide to us on a monthly basis 
the accuracy of this data has been good in north america but is questionable outside of this region 
to the extent that this data sell through and channel inventory is inaccurate in either north america or outside of north america  we may not be able to make reseller estimates or may find that our previous estimates are entirely inaccurate 
many of our distributors and resellers  on whom our revenues depend significantly  are undercapitalized yet carry multiple polycom product lines 
failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability or obtain financing could significantly affect future revenue levels for polycom 
the loss of distributors or resellers could harm our business 
in addition  the effect of the spin off of lucent technologies business equipment segment on polycom is not yet known 
in light of the restructure  if lucent decides to significantly reduce the amount of the orders to polycom  it could harm our financial condition 
channel and customer orders 
we typically ship products within a short time after receipt of an order and historically have no material backlog 
as a result  backlog  at any point in time  is not a good indicator of future net revenues and net revenues for any particular quarter cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy 
additionally  orders from our reseller customers are based on the level of demand from end users 
the uncertainty of such end user demand means that any quarter could be significantly negatively impacted by lower end user orders which could negatively affect orders we receive from our resellers 
accordingly  our expectations for both short and long term future net revenues are based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
expense levels are based  in part  on these estimates and  since we are limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly if orders and net revenues do not meet expectations in a particular period  operating results would be lower than expected 
in addition  a seasonal demand appears to be evident in a lag in demand during the summer months 
this seasonality can make predicting revenues levels difficult  if not impossible 
a substantial portion of our orders are received and shipped within the last few weeks of a quarter  therefore  should polycom  its suppliers or major customers be subject to a business interruption  for example  a natural disaster  during the last few weeks of a quarter  it would negatively affect our business 
further  we cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers will be able to meet product demand before any given quarter ends 
uncertainty of future revenues and results 
as a result of several factors  including reliance on channel sales and the timing of orders and shipments during each quarter  throughout most of each quarter  we are uncertain as to the level of revenues we will achieve in the quarter and the impact distributor stocking orders will have on revenues and profitability in that quarter 
in addition  because a substantial percentage of product sales occur at the end of the quarter  product mix and  therefore  profitability is difficult  if not impossible  to predict 
due to these factors  it is likely that in a future quarter our operating results will be materially below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease significantly 
our net revenues have grown primarily through increased market acceptance of our viewstation and soundstation product lines and through the expansion of our north american and international distribution networks 
while we have experienced growth in net revenues in recent quarters  we do not believe that the historical growth rates in net revenues will be sustainable nor are they indicative of future operating results 
for example  we lowered the price of the showstation ip effective march due to market acceptance issues for this product  similar price reductions and demand issues could occur for this and other products which could negatively impact our net revenues and profitability 
further  recent growth rates of voice and video product sales out from the sales channels to end users have been significant 
future growth rates may not achieve these levels of success 
we believe that profitability could be negatively affected in the future as a result of several factors including low to negative gross margins for the showstation ip and continuing competitive price pressure in the conferencing equipment market 
although price reductions have been driven by our desire to expand the market for our products  and we expect that in the future we may further reduce prices or introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to further expand the market or to respond to competitive pricing pressures  such actions may not expand the market for our products or be sufficient to meet competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  if end users decide to purchase the streamstation or webstation product instead of the showstation ip  our net revenues could be significantly adversely affected and it could create an excess and obsolescence issue for the showstation ip inventory which could negatively impact our profitability 
similarly  if the soundpoint pro product materially negatively affects the future sales of the soundpoint product  polycom s total revenue could be lower and it could create an excess and obsolescence issue concerning the soundpoint inventory which could lower our profitability 
for example  during the third quarter of  we recorded a charge for excess and obsolete inventory concerns for the showstation ip and soundpoint product line which negatively impacted our cost of net revenues percentage 
the issue of new products rendering existing products obsolete or reducing the demand for existing products  exists for every one of our products 
in addition  costs related to the introduction of our new products such as netengine  viewstation  viewstation fx  viewstation sp  soundpoint pro  webstation and streamstation could also negatively impact future profitability 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including market acceptance of viewstation  soundpoint pro  netengine  webstation  showstation ip  meetingsite  streamstation and other new product introductions and product enhancements by us or our competitors  the prices of our or the competition s products  the mix of products sold  the mix of products sold directly and through resellers  fluctuations in the level of international sales  the cost and availability of components  manufacturing costs  the level and cost of warranty claims  changes in our distribution network  the level of royalties to third parties and changes in general economic conditions 
for example  beginning in november  we eliminated our direct sales force and moved our direct customers to resellers in our var channel 
this sales channel shift negatively impacted our cost of net revenues percentage and will continue to negatively impact gross margins in the year in addition  competitive pressure on pricing or demand levels in a given quarter could adversely affect our operating results for such period  and such price pressure over an extended period could materially adversely affect our near and long term profitability 
our ability to maintain or increase net revenues will depend upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of the viewstation product line  soundstation  soundstation premier and soundpoint families of products  the showstation and webstation line of products  our new network access products and any new products or product enhancements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  introduce and sell new products or reduce our costs as a percentage of net revenues 
product introductions 
our revenue growth since the beginning of was due in large part to new product introductions in the video communication product line 
in each quarter of we had a major new video product introduction which significantly contributed to the revenue growth 
although we are continuing to introduce new product releases  such as the recently announced viewstation and viewstation fx  we cannot assure you that new product releases will be timely or that they will be made at all 
additionally  we cannot assure you that these or any new product introductions in will produce the revenue growth experienced in and in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements and believe that such delays may occur in the future 
for instance  we experienced delays in introducing the viewstation mp and webstation in from their original expected release dates due to unforeseen technology and manufacturing ramp issues 
additionally  the showstation ip was delayed from its original shipment target of september to its first customer shipment date of march due to engineering and manufacturing start up issues 
similar delays occurred during the introduction of the soundstation premier and the showstation affecting the first customer ship dates of these products 
any similar delays in the future for other new product offerings such as voip  desktop or netengine product line extensions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
atlas integration 
we completed the acquisition of atlas communication engines  inc in december we acquired atlas with the expectation that the acquisition would result in operating and strategic benefits  including product development and marketing and sales synergies 
if outstanding merger related issues are not successfully addressed in a coordinated  timely and efficient manner  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
the integration of atlas s product offerings and operations with our product offerings and operations and the coordination of the two companies sales and marketing efforts may require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could harm our business 
the difficulties of assimilation may be increased by the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining two different corporate cultures which may result in problems with employee retention 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of either or both of the companies businesses  which could have an adverse effect on the combined operations 
as a result of the acquisition  our operating expenses will likely increase in absolute dollars 
in fact  we are currently recruiting both management and technical staff to be added to this group 
should future expected revenues from atlas s products not occur  or occur later or in an amount less than expected  the higher operating expenses could harm our business 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies could also harm our business and results of operations 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will not incur additional material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the acquisition 
channel conflicts 
we have various oem agreements with some major telecommunications equipment manufacturers such as lucent technologies whereby we manufacture our products to work with the equipment of the oem partner 
these partnerships can create channel conflicts with other polycom distributors who directly compete with our oem partner  which could adversely affect revenue from such non oem channels 
because many of our distributors also sell equipment that compete with the polycom product lines  the distributors could devote more attention to the other product lines which could materially adversely affect our profitability 
further  other channel conflicts could arise which cause distributors to devote resources to other non polycom conferencing equipment thereby negatively affecting our business or results of operations 
we currently have agreements with certain video communication equipment providers whereby these equipment suppliers resell our soundpoint pc products along with their video communication products 
polycom and these equipment suppliers are competitors in the conferencing market and  as such  there can be no assurance that they will enter into future agreements to resell or supply any of our new or enhanced conferencing products 
further  certain current polycom video products and other video products under development are directly competitive with the products of these suppliers  and thus competition between us and the other suppliers is likely to increase  resulting in a strain on the existing relationship between the companies 
if this occurs  it could limit the potential contribution of these relationships on our results of operations 
in addition  we are dependent on certain agreements with critical partners  such as jetstream communications  in the network access arena 
conflicts may occur in this evolving market as we seek other relationships with partners competitive to our current relationships 
if this occurs  it could harm our business 
technology and training 
the markets for voice and video communication products and network access products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the success of our new viewstation and netengine is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 
additionally  properly addressing the complexities associated with dsl and isdn compatibility  reseller training  technical and sales support as well as field support are also factors that may affect our success in this market 
further  the shift of communications from the circuit switched to ip network over time may require us to add new resellers and gain new core technological competencies 
we are attempting to address these needs and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts and joint developments with other companies 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new voice  video and network access product opportunities and develop and bring new voice  video and network access products to market in a timely manner  or that competing and technologies developed by others will not render our viewstation and soundstation products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of our new voice  video and network access product development efforts on our ability to service or maintain the necessary third party interoperability licenses would harm our business and results of operations 
manufacturing disruptions 
we subcontract the manufacture of our soundstation  soundstation premier  soundpoint pro and viewstation product families and are currently migrating the production of our new network access products to celestica  inc  a global third party contract manufacturer 
we use celestica s thailand facilities and should there be any disruption in supply due to economic and political difficulties in thailand and asia  such disruption would harm our business and results of operations 
also  celestica is currently the sole source provider of these product lines and if the supply from this subcontractor experiences an interruption in operations  we would experience a delay in shipping these products which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption 
in addition  operating in the international environment exposes us to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences all of which could harm our business and results of operations 
management information system transition 
we are transitioning to a new enterprise resource planning system which affects almost every facet of our business operations 
this conversion is expected to bring new process efficiencies which should improve our business operations 
however  typically  these conversions negatively affect a company s ability to conduct business initially due to problems such as historical data conversion errors  the learning curve associated with the new system  delays in implementation or unforeseen technical problems during conversion 
if such problems arise during this transition  we could experience  for a period of time  delays in or lack of shipping  an inability to support our existing customer base  delays in paying vendors  delays in collecting from customers  an inability to place or receive product orders or other operational problems 
if this were to occur  our profitability or financial position could be negatively impacted 
infrastructure growth 
our recent overall growth has and will likely continue to cause strains on our normal business processes and infrastructure 
if we do not manage this growth through resource additions such as headcount  capital and processes  in a timely and efficient manner  future growth and profitability will likely be significantly negatively affected 
we cannot assure you that resources will be available when we need them or that capital will be available to fund these resource needs 
service and support 
our recent growth has been due in large part to an expansion into product lines with more complex technologies and protocols 
this shift  as well as the acquisition of atlas communication engines and its network products has increased the need for increased product warranty and service capabilities 
in addition  increased international competition has forced companies in the conferencing market to provide a complete service and support package 
we maintain an in house hotline support group and subcontracts on site technician support functions 
if we cannot develop and train our internal support organization  maintain our relationship with our outside technical support or efficiently transition to a new service contractor  it could negatively affect future sales of the higher technology products like video and voip equipment and network access products which would have a material negative effect on our results from operations 
cash flow fluctuations due to receivable collections 
in  we initiated a significant investment in europe to expand our business in this region 
in europe and asia  as with other international regions  credit terms are typically longer than in the united states 
therefore  as europe  asia and other international regions grow as a percentage of our total net revenues  as has happened during  accounts receivable balances will likely increase over previous years 
additionally  sales in the video communication product market typically have longer payment periods over our traditional experience in the voice communication market 
therefore  as we sell more video products as a percentage of net revenues  accounts receivable balances will increase over previous experience 
these increases will cause our days sales outstanding to increase over prior years and will negatively affect future cash flows 
in addition  we have been able to offset the affect of these influences through the additional incentives offered to resellers at the end of the quarter in the form of prepay discounts 
these additional incentives has lowered profitability and improved days sales outstanding performance 
potential asset impairment concerns 
we operate in a high technology market which is subject to rapid and frequent technology changes 
these technology changes can and do often render existing technologies obsolete 
these obsolescence issues can require write downs in inventory value when it is determined that the existing inventory can not be sold at or above net realizable value 
this situation occurred during the third quarter of for the showstation ip and the soundpoint products when we recorded million in excess and obsolescence charges and for the original showstation product in the third quarter of when we wrote down an additional million related to the loss in value associated with this inventory 
stock price flucuations 
our stock price has varied greatly as has the trading volume of our common shares 
we expect these fluctuations to continue due to factors such as announcements of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  announcements of major restructurings by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the press or investment community  general conditions in the communications industry  changes in our revenue growth rates or the growth rates of our competitors  and sales of large blocks of our stock 
the stock market will likely experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time 
many technology companies  such as polycom  have experienced such fluctuations 
in addition  our stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance 
often such fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
business interruption 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk polycom s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio and bank borrowings 
polycom does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments
