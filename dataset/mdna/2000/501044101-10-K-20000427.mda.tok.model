results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and compared to however  results are not directly comparable to results and results are not directly comparable to results due to recent acquisitions see footnote of the financial statements and also due to the change in our fiscal calendar in the calendar change 
as a result of our change in fiscal calendar  results of operations and cash flows for the day period ended january  for pre merger kroger are not included in the statements of income and cash flow 
the results include the results of ralphs food less from march  the results include the results of kui from february   hughes from march  and smith s from september   and exclude the results of ralphs food less 
vs 
sales total sales for increased or billion from billion in for some kroger divisions  fiscal contained weeks compared to weeks in total sales increased  after adjusting for the change in kroger s fiscal calendar  a rd week of sales in  and excluding sales from divested stores 
the sales increase was driven by recent acquisitions  our capital expenditure program  and strong comparable store sales 
our sales in identical food stores  which include stores in operation and not expanded or relocated for four full quarters  increased in comparable store sales  which include expansions and relocations  increased in excluding the fry s division  which converted former smith s stores to the fry s banner  identical food store sales increased and comparable store sales increased 
merchandise costs merchandise costs include advertising  warehousing and transportation expenses 
merchandise costs  net of one time expenses  an accounting change made in see note of the financial statements and the effect of lifo for the year  as a percent of sales were in and in after adjusting for the calendar change and excluding costs related to mergers  merchandise costs as a percent of sales were in coordinated purchasing  category management  technology related efficiencies and increases in private label sales were primarily responsible for the decline 
operating and administrative expenses operating and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were in and in adjusting amounts to reflect the calendar change and a week year  administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 
these costs remained flat during due to a continued high incentive payout based on performance

in addition to the above mentioned items  net earnings in compared to were affected by net interest expense of million in compared to million in and depreciation and amortization expenses of million in compared to million in ebitda our credit agreement  senior credit facility and the indentures underlying approximately million of publicly issued debt  contain various restrictive covenants 
many of these covenants are based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  lifo charge  extraordinary loss  and one time items ebitda 
the ability to generate ebitda at levels sufficient to satisfy the requirements of these agreements is a key measure of our financial strategy 
we do not intend to present ebitda as an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance 
rather  we believe the presentation of ebitda is important for understanding our performance compared to our debt covenants 
the calculation of ebitda is based on the definition contained in our credit agreement 
this may be a different definition than other companies use 
we were in compliance with all ebitda based credit agreement  senior credit facility and indenture covenants on january  ebitda for increased to billion from billion in ebitda increased primarily due to recent acquisitions  economies of scale resulting from increased sales  and from the efficiencies mentioned in merchandise costs above

recent acquisitions  our capital expenditure program and strong comparable store sales drove the sales increase 
the ralphs food less and smith s acquisitions accounted for billion of the increase 
pre merger kroger sales in identical food stores  which includes stores in operation and not expanded or relocated for four full quarters  increased in for purposes of this calculation  fred meyer  inc s comparable store sales  which include identical stores plus expanded and relocated stores  increased in for purposes of this calculation  fred meyer  inc is defined as fred meyer and its consolidated subsidiaries before the merger with kroger 
the comparable store sales calculation assumed that the ralphs food less and smith s acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the comparable periods and excluded the hughes and smitty s stores which are currently being converted to other formats 
accounting change in the second quarter of  kroger changed its application of the last in  first out  or lifo method of accounting for store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method 
the change was made to more accurately reflect inventory value by eliminating the averaging and estimation inherent in the retail method 
the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to december  cannot be determined 
the effect of the change on the december  inventory valuation  which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods  was included in restated results for the quarter ended march  this change increased merchandise costs by million and reduced earnings before extraordinary loss and net earnings by million  or per diluted share 
we have not calculated the pro forma effect on prior periods because cost information for these periods is not determinable 
the item cost method did not have a material impact on earnings subsequent to its initial adoption 
merchandise costs merchandise costs include advertising  warehousing and transportation expenses 
merchandise costs  net of one time expenses  the accounting change and lifo charge  as a percent of sales were in and in coordinated purchasing  category management  technology related efficiencies and increases in private label sales caused the decline 
operating and administrative expenses operating and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were in and in the slight increase was due to higher incentive payouts based on our performance and million of one time expenses 
these were partially offset by the suspension of contributions totaling million for to some of our multi employer pension and benefit plans

we also prefunded million of employee benefit costs at year end and compared to million at year end if we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases  which we classify as investments  and the prefunding of employee benefits  our total debt would have been billion at year end compared to billion at year end  and billion at year end we utilize interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
see footnotes eight and nine of our financial statements for further detail on our debt portfolio and interest rate swaps 
in addition to the available credit mentioned above  we currently have available for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission and declared effective on february  common stock repurchase program on january   we began repurchasing common stock in order to reduce dilution caused by our stock option plans for employees 
these repurchases were made using the proceeds  including the tax benefit  from options exercised 
further repurchases of up to million of common stock were authorized by the board of directors in october we made open market purchases totaling million in  and million in on october   we rescinded the repurchase program as a result of execution of the merger agreement between kroger and fred meyer 
in december  we began a new program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution caused by our stock option plans for employees

capital expenditures capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in  most of which was incurred to construct new stores 
the table below shows our storing activity for food stores and multi department stores beginning of year    opened acquired closed end of year    effect of inflation while management believes that some portion of the increase in sales is due to inflation  it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year to year and other pricing and competitive influences 
although management believes there was inflation in retail prices  we experienced deflation in our costs of product due to synergies and the economies of scale created by recent mergers 
by attempting to control costs and efficiently utilize resources  we strive to minimize the effects of inflation on operations 
other issues on january   we changed our fiscal year end to the saturday nearest january of each year 
this change is disclosed in our current report on form k dated january  we filed separate audited financial statements covering the transition period from january  to january  on a current report on form k dated may  these financial statements included kroger and its consolidated subsidiaries before the merger with fred meyer 
during the transition period we had sales of  million  costs and expenses of  million  and net earnings of million 
on may   we announced a distribution in the nature of a two for one stock split  to shareholders of record of common stock on june  all share amounts prior to this date have been restated to reflect the split 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard  as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  as a result  implementation of this standard is not mandatory for the company until february  based on our current portfolio  we expect that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the financial statements 
we will continue to evaluate the impact this standard will have as our portfolio changes 
we indirectly own a interest in the entity that owns the santee dairy in los angeles  california  and have a year product supply agreement with santee that requires us to purchase million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually 
the product supply agreement expires on july  upon acquisition of ralphs food less  santee became excess capacity and a duplicate facility 
we are currently engaged in efforts to dispose of our interest in santee  which may result in a loss 
we are party to more than collective bargaining agreements with local unions representing approximately  employees 
during we negotiated labor contracts without any material work stoppages 
typical agreements are three to five years in duration and  as agreements expire  we expect to enter into new collective bargaining agreements 
in  collective bargaining agreements will expire 
we cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
outlook statements elsewhere in this report and below  as well as pages three through seven of the accompanying proxy statement  regarding our expectations  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 
in particular we obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
we expect full year square footage to grow to 
we expect to continue to realize savings from economies of scale in technology and logistics  some of which may be reinvested in retail price reductions to increase sales volume and enhance market share 
we expect combination stores to generate higher sales per customer by the inclusion of numerous specialty departments  such as pharmacies  seafood shops  floral shops and bakeries 
we believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers and restaurants 
we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we expect to continue capital spending in technology focusing on improved store operations  logistics  procurement  category management  merchandising and distribution practices  which should continue to reduce merchandising costs as a percent of sales 
we expect to reduce working capital by million over the next five years 
we expect our earnings per share target to be a average annual increase over the next three years 
we expect capital expenditures for fiscal to total billion  excluding acquisitions 
capital expenditures reflect kroger s strategy of growth through expansion and acquisitions as well as our emphasis  whenever possible  on self development and ownership of store real estate  and on logistics and technology improvements 
we intend to use the combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements for  currently budgeted to be approximately billion billion  excluding acquisitions 
if determined preferable  we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities  entering into sale leaseback transactions  or by issuing additional debt or equity 
we expect to achieve million in synergy savings over the next three years as a result of our mergers 
we project the timing of the annual savings by fiscal year to be as follows million in  million in  and million in and beyond 
the following factors are among the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population  employment and job growth in our markets  pricing pressures and competitive factors  which could include pricing strategies  store openings and remodels  results of our programs to reduce costs and improve working capital  the ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and achieve operating improvements at those companies  increases in labor costs and relations with union bargaining units representing our employees  changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements  opportunities or acquisitions that we pursue  and the availability and terms of financing 
in particular  our ability to achieve the expected increases in sales and earnings could be adversely affected by the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate 
in addition any labor dispute  delays in opening new stores  or changes in the economic climate could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets 
while we expect to reduce working capital  our ability to do so may be impaired by any changes in vendor payment terms or systems problems that result in increases in inventory levels 
our capital expenditures could fall outside of the expected range if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs exceed those budgeted  or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
while we expect to achieve benefits through logistics and technology  development of new systems and integration of systems due to our merger with fred meyer carry inherent uncertainties  and we may not achieve the expected benefits 
unforeseen difficulties in integrating fred meyer with kroger  or any other acquired entity  could cause us to fail to achieve the anticipated synergy savings  and could otherwise adversely affect our ability to meet our earnings per share expectations 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward looking statements contained within this document 
year disclosure we did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in our operating or business systems either when the date changed from to or on february  based on operations since january   we do not expect any significant impact on our ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues may occur with billing  payroll  or financial closings at period  quarter  or year end 
we believe that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  we could still be negatively affected if the year or similar issues adversely affect our customers or suppliers 
we currently are not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for our customers and suppliers 
we spent million on year readiness efforts in and a total of million from through these efforts included replacing some outdated  noncompliant hardware and noncompliant software as well as identifying and remediating year problems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk kroger has historically used derivatives to limit its exposure to rising interest rates 
during  as a result of the merger with fred meyer  the nature and magnitude of our debt portfolio changed significantly  including a permanent reduction in the combined company s variable rate borrowings 
this fundamental change in our debt portfolio resulted in the existing derivative portfolio no longer being aligned with the debt portfolio  and prompted us to eliminate all existing interest rate swap and cap agreements  at a cost of million 
going forward  we will use derivatives primarily to fix the rates on variable rate debt 
to do this  we use the following guidelines use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less by april of  include no leveraged derivative products  and hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
we review compliance with these guidelines annually with the financial policy committee of our board of directors 
in addition  our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on an annual basis 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the table below provides information about our interest rate derivative and underlying debt portfolio 
the amount each year represents the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the outstanding notional amount of interest rate derivatives 
interest rates reflect the weighted average for the maturing instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on six month libor using the forward yield curve as of january  the fair value column includes the fair value of those debt instruments for which it is reasonably possible to calculate a fair value and the fair value of our interest rate derivatives as of january  see footnotes eight and nine 
expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions of dollars long term debt fixed rate   average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate average notional amounts outstanding thereafter total fair value in millions of dollars interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate interest rate collar it was not practicable to determine a fair value for million of fixed rate debt 
the interest rate collar is reset based on the three month libor with the following impact if the three month libor is less than or equal to  we pay for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than or equal to  we are exposed to floating interest rates for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than  we pay  and if the three month libor is greater than or equal to  we are exposed to floating interest rates for that three month period
