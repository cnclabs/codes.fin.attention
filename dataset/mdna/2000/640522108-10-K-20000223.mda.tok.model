item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview we are a leading developer of proprietary technologies for the synthesis and manufacture of complex carbohydrates 
our proprietary enzymatic technology platform enables the rapid and cost effective synthesis of a wide range of complex carbohydrates in commercial quantities 
we use our broad  enabling technology to produce complex carbohydrates for pharmaceutical  biotechnology  nutritional  and consumer product applications 
due to their structural complexity  complex carbohydrates have been difficult and expensive to produce  and their commercial development has been significantly limited 
we have incurred operating losses each year 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect additional losses for some time as we expand research and development efforts  expand manufacturing scale up activities  and begin sales and marketing activities 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues from collaborative agreements increased to  in from  in substantially all of our revenues during were payments received by us under our collaborative agreements with bristol myers and wyeth 
substantially all of our revenues during were payments received by us under our collaborative agreement with bristol myers 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased funding of outside research  and the amortization of acquired technology from cytel corporation 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased patent and general legal expenses associated with the intellectual property acquired from cytel corporation  and increased business development expense 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to higher average cash and marketable securities balances during interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to lower average loan balances outstanding during years ended december  and revenues from collaborative agreements decreased to  in from  in substantially all of our revenues during were payments received by us under our collaborative agreement with bristol myers 
substantially all of our revenues during were payments received by us under our collaborative agreement with abbott 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to hiring additional scientific personnel and increased purchases of laboratory supplies and services related to our collaborative agreement with mcneil  and increased funding of external research 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased patent and business development expenses compared to the prior year  which included expenses related to entering into our collaboration with mcneil 
interest income decreased to million in from million in due to lower average cash balances during interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to lower average loan balances outstanding during liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have financed our operations through private and public offerings of our securities  and revenues from our collaborative agreements 
we had million in cash and marketable securities as of december   compared to million in cash and marketable securities as of december  this increase was primarily attributable to our completion of two private placements of common stock totaling million 
the increase was partly offset by the use of funds for the acquisition of intellectual property from cytel corporation and for our continuing operating activities 
under the terms of our joint venture with mcneil  we may be required to make additional capital contributions to fund capital expenditures 
if the joint venture builds additional production facilities  and we wish to maintain our ownership in the joint venture  we are required to contribute half of such expenditures  up to a maximum contribution of million 
however  we may elect to contribute as little as million of the cost of the facilities  so long as our aggregate capital contributions are at least of the joint venture s aggregate capital contributions 
in this case  mcneil will fund the remainder of our half of the joint venture s capital expenditures  and our ownership percentage will be proportionately reduced 
we have an option  expiring in september  to return to ownership in the joint venture by reimbursing mcneil for this amount 
in addition  until the joint venture is profitable  mcneil is required to fund  as a non recourse  no interest loan  all of the joint venture s aggregate capital expenditures in excess of an agreed upon amount  and all of the joint venture s operating losses 
these loans would be repayable by the joint venture to mcneil over seven years  and in the event of any dissolution of the joint venture would be payable to mcneil before any distribution of assets to us 
we will account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method  under which we will recognize our share of earnings and losses of the joint venture 
we will record our share of the losses of the joint venture  however  only to the extent of our actual or committed investment in the joint venture 
in  we recorded a loss from operations of the joint venture of  which is included in research and development expense 
on march   we acquired the carbohydrate manufacturing patents  licenses  and other intellectual property of cytel corporation 
we paid million in cash to cytel and an additional million in cash into escrow  the release of which is conditioned on cytel s satisfaction  prior to september   of certain matters relating to the acquired patents and licenses 
we have recorded the million placed into escrow as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
any cash remaining in the escrow account on september  will be returned to us and will be available for general corporate purposes 
because the acquired intellectual property consists of core technology with alternative future uses  we have capitalized million of the amount paid to cytel as acquired technology 
the remaining  was charged to expenses in our consolidated statement of operations in in addition  we agreed to pay cytel up to an additional million in cash  contingent on potential payments and revenues realized by us from certain future corporate collaborations  so long as we enter into any such collaboration by march  we are obligated to pay  of the million as a result of entering into a collaboration with wyeth 
the acquired technology balance will be amortized to our consolidated statement of operations over eight years  which we estimate to be the useful life of the technology 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization expense of  relating to the acquired technology 
in  we issued  through the montgomery county pennsylvania industrial development authority  million of taxable and tax exempt bonds 
the bonds were issued to finance the purchase of our previously leased building and the construction of a pilot scale manufacturing facility within our building 
the bonds are supported by an aa rated letter of credit  and a reimbursement agreement between our bank and the letter of credit issuer 
the interest rate on the bonds will vary weekly  depending on market rates for aa rated taxable and tax exempt obligations  respectively 
during  the weighted average  effective interest rate was per annum  including letter of credit and other fees 
to provide credit support for this arrangement  we have given a first mortgage on the land  building  improvements  and certain machinery and equipment to our bank 
in addition  we have agreed to maintain at least million of cash and short term investments 
if we fail to comply with this covenant  we are required to deposit with the lender cash collateral up to  but not more than  the loan s unpaid balance  which was million as of december  during   and  we purchased approximately million  million  and million of property  equipment  and building improvements 
we expect that our existing cash and short term investments will be adequate to fund our operations through at least  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may cause us to deplete our cash and short term investments sooner than the above estimate 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including if or when any products manufactured using our technology are commercialized 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on how those accounting rules should be applied  and specifically addresses revenue recognition for non refundable technology access fees in the biotechnology industry 
sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating sab and the effect it may have on our financial statements 
at this time  we believe that sab will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not hold any investments in market risk sensitive instruments 
accordingly  we believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments
