overview we are a leading provider of end to end solutions for enterprise retailers and retail chains 
our products link retail management information  including merchandising  planning and financial analysis  with point of sale information  automating the full operations of a retailer and providing centralized access to information throughout a chain of retail stores 
we also provide consulting  project management  application training  technical support and other services to our retail industry customers 
our training products division develops and distributes computer courseware and computer skills testing products 
our recent growth has primarily been through acquisitions 
the largest and most important of these acquisitions have been o applied retail solutions  inc ars in july for aggregate consideration of million in cash and stock paid to the former stockholders  and o island pacific systems corporation in april for million cash 
ars is a leading provider of store software systems that now form the core of our svi post solutions  island pacific is a leading provider of retail management systems that now form the core of our svi host solutions 
we accounted for both the ars and island pacific acquisitions using purchase accounting  which has resulted in the addition of significant goodwill and capitalized software assets on our balance sheet 
we are amortizing capitalized software and goodwill from both of these acquisitions over ten years  which has and will continue to impact reported net income and earnings per share 
subsequent to fiscal year end  we consolidated ars and island pacific into svi retail  inc during the fiscal year we began promoting the full suite of retail software solutions created by the combination of the ars and island pacific products with some of our other retail software products under the brand name the total point of business 
we have commenced an active campaign to cross sell solutions to those retailers who utilize less than our full suite of products 
during fiscal  we also commenced an active product development program to more fully integrate of our svi post and svi host products  to develop versions of our products in other programming languages to eliminate dependency on client server architecture  and to develop new components and applications of our end to end solution 
we plan to continue our product development program through fiscal and beyond  subject to the availability of operating or outside capital 
we currently derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of software licenses and the provision of related consulting and support services 
software license fees are for the most part dependent upon the number of locations in which the customer plans to install and utilize the software 
as the customer adds additional locations  we charge additional license fees 
we typically charge for support  maintenance and software updates on an annual basis pursuant to renewable service contracts 
we typically charge for consulting  implementation and project management services on an hourly basis 
our sales cycles typically run four to twelve months  which causes our revenues to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we typically recognize software license revenues as products are shipped 
if the sale involves significant production  modification or customization  we recognize the license revenues ratably based on percentage of completion 
we generally recognize revenues for service contracts over the life of the contract  and for consulting  implementation and project management services as the services are provided 
we sold our ibis systems limited subsidiary effective january  to kielduff investments limited  a company affiliated with ibis s management team 
the consideration was million cash  svi common stock valued at million and a promissory note representing a net obligation to us of million 
ibis which subsequent to disposition was acquired by a subsidiary of integrity software  inc provided financial and business software applications for the building  leasing and general financial industries  primarily in the united kingdom 
we originally acquired ibis in october as part of an integrated transaction through which softline limited became our majority stockholder 
the operations of ibis are shown in our financial statements as discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended march  and the transitional fiscal year ended march  our operations are conducted principally in the united states  the united kingdom and australia 
prior to our sale of triple s in october  we had operations in south africa 
we offer similar products in each geographical region and we evaluate local operations primarily based on total revenues and operating income 
we also manage long lived assets by geographic region 
the geographic distribution of our revenues and long lived assets for the fiscal years ended march   march   march  six months and september  is as follows in thousands year ended year ended six months ended year ended march  march  march  sept 
 in thousands net sales united states   australia     south africa   united kingdom  united kingdom discontinued operations   total net sales     long lived assets united states    australia     south africa  united kingdom united kingdom discontinued operations   total long lived assets     we classify operations into two divisions  retail software solutions and training products 
as revenues  earnings and assets related to the training division are below the threshold established for segment reporting  we consider our business to consist of one reportable operating segment 
recent developments in may  we announced that we are in discussions with softline limited concerning a possible business combination between softline and svi 
softline is a global software and services group focused on the development  implementation and support of business and accounting software applications 
softline currently beneficially owns approximately of svi s common shares 
softline is the largest accounting and payroll software vendor in south africa and one of the largest in australia  and also markets accounting software applications in the united states  united kingdom and other jurisdictions 
svi and softline have no binding agreement and have not yet established terms of a potential transaction 
any such transaction will be subject to governmental approvals by united states and south african authorities 
any transaction may also be subject to approval of the stockholders of svi and or softline 
any business combination between svi and softline will have a material impact on our operations and future prospects 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold certain technology rights to an unrelated third party for million 
we initially recorded this transaction as revenue during the second quarter  but we subsequently determined that the revenue from the sale should have been deferred until the time of payment 
we received payment of the first million during the first quarter of fiscal and expect to receive the balance during the second quarter of fiscal this revenue will increase earnings for the periods in which the payments are received  but is of a non recurring nature 
the sale of these rights is not expected to otherwise impact results of operations 
results of operations presentation of results of operations following the close of our fiscal year ended september   we changed our fiscal year end to march  commencing with the fiscal year ended march  our consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows included in this report show results for the following periods o the fiscal year ended march   o the fiscal year ended march   o the twelve months ended march  unaudited  o the six months ended march   and o the fiscal year ended september  the six month period ended march  and the twelve month period ended september  are not comparable to the fiscal years ended march  and accordingly  the discussion and analysis below compares fiscal to fiscal  and fiscal to the comparable unaudited twelve month period ended march   which includes the results for the transitional six month fiscal year ended march  plus the last two quarters of the fiscal year ended september  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales 
twelve months ended march  unaudited percentage percentage percentage amount of revenue amount of revenue amount of revenue in thousands except for percentages net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    expenses product development  depreciation and amortization    selling  general and administrative    total expenses    income loss from operations    other income expense  gain on disposals of softline limited shares  income before provision benefit for income taxes    provision benefit for income taxes    income loss from continuing operations    discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of taxes   gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of applicable taxes income from discontinued operations   net income loss    fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net sales was primarily due to the following o inclusion of million in sales from island pacific  which was acquired at the beginning of fiscal year o increase of million in sales from ars 
ars was acquired in july  therefore  the results in the fiscal year ended march  included only nine months of operations 
o offset in part by a decrease of million in sales from australian operations due to a downturn in demand for software licenses and related consulting and support services in australia 
we experienced a decline in demand for software licenses during the last six months of calendar year we believe this was due to deferred purchasing decisions related to the millennium change and anticipation of new products to be announced at industry trade shows in early calendar year this decline in demand continued to negatively affect sales of software licenses during our fourth quarter 
because our sales cycles tend to range from four to twelve months  we remain cautious about our expectations for sales of software licenses and related services in near term future periods due to the interruption in sales cycles 
we are not able to predict whether the decreased demand we have experienced will continue to affect sales in the longer term 
cost of sales cost of sales increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due the inclusion of cost of sales from island pacific 
gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of high profit margin sales from island pacific 
island pacific s sales generally do not involve lower margin hardware sales 
product development expenses product development expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million or of net sales 
there were no product development expenses in the comparative period 
in conjunction with the acquisition of island pacific  we commenced an active integration and product development program to ensure compatibility between our point of sale svi post and retail management svi host products 
additionally  we are developing versions of our products in other program languages to reduce hardware dependencies 
we expect to continue or increase the present level of spending on product development for the foreseeable future as we continue to integrate  develop and enhance our products to address the evolving needs of the retail industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was due to the following o inclusion of selling  general and administrative expenses of million from island pacific  which was acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year o increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses from ars 
o increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses to expand marketing and investor relations activities 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of million in intangible assets in the acquisition of island pacific 
these intangible assets are being amortized over estimated lives not exceeding ten years 
other income expense other income expense decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to an increase of million in interest expense in fiscal year and life insurance proceeds of million received in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense was due to the million in notes payable obtained in fiscal year to acquire island pacific 
discontinued operations effective january   we sold our ibis systems limited subsidiary for million 
we recorded a gain of million  net of applicable income taxes of million 
accordingly  the results of operations of ibis for fiscal are shown as discontinued operations 
fiscal year ended march  compared to twelve months ended march  net sales net sales decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable period ended march  the decrease in net sales was due to a decrease of million in sales from australian operations 
this decrease resulted from the completion in march of several large contracts with a major retail group in australia  which included significant hardware sales 
the decrease in net sales was offset by the inclusion of million in revenues from ars  which was acquired in july  and an increase of million in sales from our training products division 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the twelve months ended march  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in cost of sales from australian operations  offset by the inclusion of million in cost of sales from ars 
gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the twelve months ended march  gross profit  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in the fiscal year ended march  from in the comparable period 
the increase was due to a change in the sales mix away from lower margin hardware sales toward higher margin software licenses and related services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the twelve months ended march  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to the inclusion of million in selling  general and administrative expenses from ars  which was acquired in july  and an increase of million in corporate level general expenses 
this increase was offset by a decrease of million in selling  general and administrative expenses from the decrease in sales from australia 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the twelve months ended march  increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to million of depreciation and amortization from intangible assets recorded in the acquisition of ars  which was acquired in july other income other income increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the twelve months ended march  this increase was primarily due to life insurance proceeds of million received in the fiscal year gain on sale of softline limited shares during the twelve months ended march   we reported a gain of million on the sale of softline limited shares yielding net proceeds of million 
we have no further equity holdings in softline limited 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations consisted of income from ibis  which we acquired effective october  and which we sold effective january  income from discontinued operations increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the twelve months ended march  the increase was due to the inclusion of ibis results in discontinued operations for three quarters of fiscal compared to two quarters of the comparable period  and to a shift within ibis from lower margin hardware sales to higher margin software sales 
liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended march   we financed our operations through internally generated cash  proceeds from bank and other loans  a loan from a related party  proceeds from the sale of common stock and the exercise of options  and a bank line of credit 
during the fiscal year ended march   we financed our operations primarily through internally generated cash and proceeds from the exercise of options 
during the transitional fiscal year ended march  and the fiscal year ended september   we financed our operations primarily through internally generated cash  proceeds from the sale of common stock and proceeds from the sale of shares of softline limited common stock 
cash and cash equivalents at march  were million  a decrease of million from million at march  we continue to hold a million including accrued interest at march  note receivable obtained in connection with our sale of ibis systems limited 
to secure this receivable  we obtained a security interest in the stock of ibis 
the purchaser did not repay the note on the original due date of october  because it had not yet completed a reorganization that was intended to serve as the source of funds to repay the note 
the due date of the note has been extended to november  we permitted the purchaser to proceed with its reorganization with a wholly owned subsidiary of integrity software  inc  a publicly traded company with prices quoted on the national quotation bureau pink sheets under the symbol inty 
the purchaser exchanged all of the outstanding ibis stock for  common shares of integrity  representing approximately of integrity s outstanding shares at march  we agreed to substitute our security interest in the ibis shares for a security interest in the purchaser s integrity shares 
we also obtained the right to convert all or any portion of the unpaid indebtedness under the note to integrity shares valued at per share and limited rights to require integrity to register such shares for resale under the securities act 
integrity bid quotations have ranged from to per share from january  to june   but the market for integrity shares has been limited 
these quotations may not represent actual transactions 
to our knowledge  the purchaser s only asset is the integrity shares it holds 
the purchaser s ability to pay is therefore entirely dependent on its ability to sell the integrity shares 
the purchaser is an affiliate of integrity  and its ability to sell the integrity shares will be limited by law and by market conditions 
a recent third party valuation of the integrity shares securing the note supports the carrying value of the note receivable on our balance sheet at march  however  we do not know when or if the purchaser of ibis or we will be able to realize liquidity from the integrity shares  as the legal and practical ability of both the purchaser and us to resell such shares is limited by applicable securities laws and market conditions 
we cannot guarantee that the value of the integrity shares will remain high enough to support the carrying value of the note receivable  and we may be required to impair the value of the note receivable should the value of the integrity shares decline 
any such impairment would adversely affect our results of operations during the period or periods in which it occurs 
we have reclassified this note receivable as a long term asset due to the uncertainty of the marketability of the integrity shares and the dependence on such marketability for collection 
we purchased all of the outstanding stock of island pacific in june for million cash 
we paid the purchase price using cash on hand  cash acquired from the sale of our ibis systems limited subsidiary  cash acquired from the exercise of options by softline  two bank loans totaling million and million in other loans  including million from a major stockholder 
the bank loans are secured by all of our stock in and all of the assets of our us retail software subsidiaries  and of our stock in our australian retail software subsidiary 
one loan was in the amount of million and was fully amortizing over two years 
the other loan required interest only payments until maturity at december  we expected to retire the million loan on or before maturity using proceeds from the million note receivable obtained in connection with the sale of ibis  however  our agreement with the bank permitted us to convert the million loan to a two year fully amortizing term loan subject to certain terms and conditions 
because the million note receivable was not paid on its original due date  we were not able to retire the million bank loan as anticipated 
rather than convert the loan  we negotiated extensions of the due date of the million obligation while we searched for a replacement source of capital to retire the loan 
we made a million principal payment on this loan in may using proceeds from the sale of common stock in a private placement 
in may and june  we agreed to consolidate the approximately million balance of the two loans into a single loan and to terminate the conversion option 
in july  softline limited loaned us million for the purpose of making a million principal payment on this loan 
in july  we refinanced the million balance due on the bank loan 
under the amended loan agreement  we are required beginning august  to pay  per month toward reduction of principal plus interest on the outstanding balance at the rate of over the bank s prime rate  increasing to over the bank s prime rate after december  we are also required to pay to the bank as a reduction of principal one half of amounts received from a certain million contract receivable from a one time sale  any amounts we receive from the sale of the shares of common stock of integrity software  inc which secure the related note receivable for million  and any amounts we receive from the issuance of debt or equity securities other than stock option exercises 
we also maintain a million line of credit with this bank  and the line is subject to the provisions and restrictions of the amended loan agreement 
the entire remaining balance of the consolidated bank loan and the lines of credit  if any  will be due and payable april  if we make no principal prepayments on the consolidated loan amount other than the required monthly payments  the balance at the maturity date would be million plus the amount outstanding on our credit lines 
the loans are subject to certain financial covenants and contain limitations on acquisitions  investments and other borrowings 
we plan to obtain replacement financing for the entire amount owing to the bank prior to the maturity date 
however  there can be no guarantee that replacement financing will be available on acceptable terms and conditions  or at all 
the million loan from softline obtained to reduce the bank indebtedness is due august  the loan is subordinated to the bank obligations and bears interest at per annum payable monthly 
we intend to use proceeds we might receive from payment of the note receivable or from sale of the shares of the common stock of integrity software  inc into which such note is convertible and which secure such note to repay the loan from softline 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to resell sufficient integrity shares to repay this loan 
we may have to use any proceeds from the sale of these shares first to satisfy the remaining bank obligation 
if we are not able to repay some or all of the softline loan through these means  we will likely be required to seek outside debt or equity financing 
we currently have no commitments for such financing  and we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and conditions  or at all 
in connection with our acquisition of island pacific  we also borrowed million with no stated maturity date from three entities 
million of such amount was borrowed from a major stockholder 
the balance due on these loans at june  was million 
the loans bear interest at the prime rate 
we have million of credit lines to support working capital requirements 
million of this amount is subject to the amended loan agreement concerning the consolidated loan obtained to acquire island pacific described above  and the then outstanding balance is due and payable on april   if not sooner retired 
as of june   the outstanding balance on all of our lines is million 
we have been using operating income  cash received from the sale of common stock and cash received from the exercise of options to discharge the payments due on the bank loans and lines of credit 
we used million borrowed from softline to pay million due on the bank loan in july during the year ended march   softline exercised options to purchase shares of svi common stock for net proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to pay a portion of the island pacific purchase price  the deferred portion of the purchase price for our triple s subsidiary which was sold to softline in october and for working capital 
in march  we sold common stock to one investor in a private placement for net proceeds of million 
we agreed to register the resale of such shares under the securities act 
we also granted the investor a repricing right through which the investor may receive additional shares of common stock 
the number of additional shares to be issued will be determined based on the following formula number of additional shares p x  p  where p x the average of the closing price of our stock on the american stock exchange for the five days preceding the effective date of a registration statement registering the resale of such share under the securities act 
we have not yet filed a registration statement for the resale of such shares 
other than cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of the line of credit  we have no material unused sources of liquid assets 
cash provided by used for operating activities in the periods ended march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
cash used for operating activities during fiscal year primarily resulted from a million net loss  a million increase in accounts receivable and other receivables  a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a million increase in interest receivable  a million decrease in income tax payable  and a million increase in deferred income taxes liability  offset in part by million of non cash depreciation and amortization expense and a million increase in deferred revenue 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year resulted from million in net income  million of depreciation and amortization  and a million increase in income taxes payable  offset in part by a million increase in accounts receivable and other receivables  a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a million gain on disposal of softline limited shares 
cash provided by operating activities in the twelve months ended march  resulted from million in net income  million of depreciation and amortization  million of non cash compensation expense  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and a million increase in income taxes payable  offset in part by an million gain on disposal of softline limited shares and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased during fiscal year primarily due to inclusion of island pacific accounts receivable of million at march  and a million receivable associated with the non recurring sale of technology rights by our australian subsidiary 
revenue recognition from this sale was deferred until payment expected in fiscal year accounts receivable increased during fiscal year primarily due to inclusion of ars accounts receivable of million and an increase in receivables from our australian subsidiary 
accounts receivable balances fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors including acquisitions and dispositions  seasonality  shifts in customer buying patterns  contractual payment terms  the underlying mix of products and services sold  and geographic concentration of revenues 
cash provided by used for investing activities in the periods ended march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
investing activities during fiscal year included a million net cash payment for the acquisition of island pacific  million in purchase of software and capitalized software development costs and million in capital expenditures 
investing activities in fiscal year included million in net cash payments for the acquisition of ars  million in net cash payments for other acquisitions related to our former ibis subsidiary and million in capital expenditures  offset by million in net proceeds from the sale of ibis 
investing activities in the twelve months ended march  included million in net proceeds from sale of softline limited shares  million in proceeds from maturity of certificates of deposit  and million net cash acquired from the acquisition of divergent technologies pty 
ltd  offset in part by a million net cash payment for the acquisition of assets related to our former ibis subsidiary  million in purchases of software and capitalized software development costs and million in capital expenditures 
cash provided by used for financing activities in the periods ended march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
financing activities during fiscal year included million in proceeds from loans obtained to acquire island pacific  million in proceeds from the exercise of options and private sale of common stock and million in proceeds from lines of credit  offset in part by million in loan payments 
financing activities in fiscal year included million in cash payments to repurchase common stock  offset in part by million proceeds from the exercise of options 
financing activities in the twelve months ended march  included million in proceeds from issuance of common stock and million in proceeds from an affiliate  offset by a million decrease in amounts due to stockholders and million in payments on lines of credit 
changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign operations had the effect of reducing cash by million  million and million in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we did not enter into any hedging transactions to manage foreign currency risk during any of the reported periods 
we believe we have sufficient cash and will generate sufficient revenues from operations to meet our cash needs through fiscal we may however be required to reduce expenditures on certain product development activities if normal sales cycles  impacted by the millennium change and other factors  do not resume as expected 
while such reductions would impact our long term strategy of enhancing and integrating our existing products and developing new products  we do not believe they would impact short term results of operations 
we may require outside sources of debt or equity financing to discharge the then outstanding bank indebtedness due april  and the note payable to softline due august  we are considering various alternatives for equity financing to retire some or all of our outstanding indebtedness and to pursue further product development initiatives 
at this time  we have no firm commitments for such outside financing  and there is no guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and conditions  or at all 
we expect to continue our strategy of seeking acquisition opportunities within our target profile of companies with advanced technologies and market leadership in the enterprise retail solutions sector 
we cannot guarantee that any such acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  or that any such acquisitions will ultimately be consummated 
to the extent that the terms of any such acquisitions call for payment in cash  we will likely need to seek an outside source of capital 
we have not identified any sources for such capital  and there can be no guarantee that such capital will be available on acceptable terms and conditions  or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities with the instruments measured at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the accounting for changes in fair value gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
we have not yet completed the process of evaluating the impact that will result from the adoption of sfas no 
 however  on a preliminary basis  we do not believe the eventual adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues  including software revenue recognition 
we will be required to adopt sab in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of sab will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
year as of july   our products  computing and communications infrastructure systems have operated without year related problems and appear to be year ready 
we are not aware that any of our major customers or third party suppliers have experienced significant year related problems 
we believe all our critical systems are year ready 
however  there is no guarantee that we have discovered all possible failure points 
we will address any year problems experienced by our customers through normal maintenance and warranty procedures 
year compliance costs were not material in any prior period and were funded from working capital 
as discussed above  we believe that concern over potential year problems impacted sales and the normal commencement of sales cycles for our software licenses during the second half of calendar year these effects may continue to adversely affect our revenues until normal sales cycles resume 
euro currency in january  participating european economic and monetary union emu countries introduced the ecu or euro as a new currency 
during  all participating emu countries are expected to convert to the euro as their single currency 
during the next two years  participating emu countries will conduct business in both the existing national currency and the euro 
companies operating in or conducting business in these emu member countries will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
we believe that all of our internal financial and software systems can accommodate the dual currency system and the full conversion to the euro 
our retail software products are designed to operate in any foreign currency  including the euro 
we cannot guarantee however that our products will operate without modification through full conversion to the euro or meet all of the euro currency requirements 
if our software products do not meet all the euro currency requirements  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have not had and do not expect a material impact on our results of operations from foreign currency gains or losses as a result of the transition to the euro as the functional currency for our operations in emu countries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  changes in foreign currency exchange rate as measured against the us dollar and changes in the value of stock of a publicly traded company which secures a promissory note we hold 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit borrowings and variable rate term loans  which totaled million at march  based on this balance  a change in one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million or per basic and diluted share  on an annual basis 
these instruments were not entered into for trading purposes and carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from the bank s prime interest rate 
our objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe and australia 
sales are typically denominated in the local foreign currency  which creates exposures to changes in exchange rates 
these changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
we attempt to minimize currency exposure risk through decentralized sales  development  marketing and support operations  in which substantially all costs are local currency based 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the foreign currency 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risk 
approximately  and of our total net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods ended march   and  respectively 
equity price risk we have no direct equity investments 
however  we have a note receivable in the amount of million which is secured by shares of the common stock of integrity software  inc integrity  a publicly traded company with shares quoted on the national quotation bureau pink sheets 
we also have the right to convert the note into common stock of integrity at a fixed price 
we are therefore exposed to indirect equity price risk 
we have not taken steps to mitigate this risk  and a decline in the trading price of integrity common stock may impair the value of and our ability to collect the million receivable
