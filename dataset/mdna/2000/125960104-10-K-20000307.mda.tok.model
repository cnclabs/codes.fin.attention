item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview overall  was again a challenging year 
poor conditions continued in several of the markets the company serves 
low hog prices and resulting loss in producer profitability adversely affected demand for the company s products to a greater extent than in when the market downturn began  while slowness in asia  due to economic conditions that developed in late  continued to suppress the company s export sales to asia and also contributed to slowness in other international markets in conversely  sales of products to the domestic grain market were especially strong in in large part due to a strong harvest and low grain prices 
in the egg production market  demand for the company s products was strong in the first half of  but high egg supplies forced low egg prices to develop in the second quarter which served to slow company sales late in the year 
the company expects the demand for grain storage to return to somewhat lower levels in comparable to s performance 
it expects expansion in the market for poultry meat comparable to levels while the industry attempts to keep supplies in balance with demand 
the company believes that the egg production and hog industries are taking appropriate actions to reduce the oversupply of hens and hogs and that these markets will rebound in mid to late or in the company further anticipates recovery in some latin american and asian countries during  and stronger sales in certain other regions 
in response to the market conditions we have restructured the company to provide greater focus and accountability throughout the organization 
we have reduced employment levels by over to better align the cost structure with current conditions 
other notable accomplishments in include o the acquisition of roxell nv in january to enhance the company s global position in poultry and hog feeding equipment 
o improved working capital management resulting in a reduction of accounts receivable and inventory allowing the company to significantly reduce debt 
o reduction of exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the brazilian currency  which created a significant negative earnings impact in  by restructuring of intercompany debt late in the year 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage relationship to net sales of items derived from the consolidated statements of income and the percentage change from year to year 
percentage increase decrease percentage of net sales vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill operating income interest expense  net gain on sale of vinyl division joint venture loss other income before income taxes income taxes net income compared to net sales increased to million in compared to million in the nominal sales growth resulted from a combination of factors 
increased sales in were primarily from the acquisitions of roxell nv in january and sibley industries  inc and staco  inc 
in the second half of and from strength in the grain production market 
these factors were offset primarily by million in lower revenues from poultry buildings as well as by weakness in the hog business worldwide and softness in various international markets 
sales of the company s products to markets outside the us and canada were million in  an increase of million or 
gross profit increased to million in or of net sales compared to million in or of net sales 
the gross profit margin increase of percentage points was largely attributable to reduced sales on essentially no margin poultry buildings  which are substantially completed  and to recovery of manufacturing efficiencies as the issues related to the implementation of an integrated enterprise resource planning system have been substantially resolved  as well as to improvements in operational efficiency made in these factors have been offset somewhat by further weakening in the worldwide hog market in which the company has traditionally sold higher margin products  a restructuring charge of million and a purchase accounting charge of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million to million in from million in as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in the dollar increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of roxell nv  sibley industries  inc and staco  inc  and a restructuring charge of million offset somewhat by savings from restructuring actions taken in and reduction in costs of resources assigned to address issues related to the implementation of an integrated enterprise resource planning system 
the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to the acquisitions 
the acquired companies have historically had higher selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales than the company

the increase in operating income margins is due to the improved gross profit margins offset to some extent by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales and the increase in amortization expense as a percent of sales  as discussed above 
interest expense increased to million in or from million in the increase is due primarily to additional debt as a result of the borrowings incurred to finance the acquisitions of roxell nv  sibley industries  inc and staco  inc  and purchases of treasury stock 
other expense includes foreign exchange and joint venture losses

the diluted shares outstanding at december  were million shares  a decrease of million shares or compared to million diluted shares outstanding at december  the decrease in shares outstanding is attributable to the repurchase of million shares of common stock during compared to net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase reflects the fancom acquisition  the kansas city grain systems division acquisition  the sibley industries  inc acquisition and the staco  inc acquisition that were completed in may  june  july  and september  respectively 
the increase also reflects a strong domestic market for egg production equipment and success in the company s bundled package of products strategy which has led to domestic market share gains in the poultry sector 
further gains can be attributed to mexican poultry market strength and revenues of million from poultry buildings 
the continued weakness in overseas economies  particularly in asia and brazil  along with global weakness in the hog market  all contributed negatively to the revenue line during sales of the company s products to markets outside the us and canada were million in  an increase of million or 
gross profit increased to million in or of net sales compared to million in or of net sales 
gross profit dollars increased due to higher sales levels in the gross profit margin decrease of percentage points was partly attributable to lower margins relating to the sales of poultry buildings at essentially no margin under projects expected to last into the second quarter of  sales declines in higher margin hog sector products  sales increases in lower margin products  and the continued weakness in overseas economies  particularly in asia  which has reduced the company s exports of higher margin products to customers in the region and to customers that supply the region 
manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the implementation of an integrated enterprise resource planning system negatively affected dollars and margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million to million in from million in as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in the dollar increase is primarily attributable to the increased size of the company resulting from the kansas city grain systems division acquisition  the fancom acquisition  the sibley industries  inc acquisition and the staco  inc 
acquisition  targeted investments in certain key areas within the company  and the effect of our implementation of an integrated enterprise resource planning system partially offset by lower bonuses and profit sharing expense due to lower than expected performance 
amortization of goodwill increased to million in or from million in the increase is attributable to the amortization of goodwill purchased in the fancom acquisition  the kansas city grain systems division acquisition  the sibley industries  inc acquisition and the staco  inc

net income decreased or million to million in from million in the decrease was due to lower operating income and joint venture related charges in and the million after tax gain on sale related to the divestiture of the company s vinyl division in offset somewhat by lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate  primarily a result of non deductible goodwill in related to the vinyl division divestiture 
diluted weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding during were million shares compared to million shares in  an increase of 
the diluted shares outstanding at december  were million shares  a decrease of million shares or compared to million diluted shares outstanding at december  the decrease in diluted shares outstanding at year end is primarily attributable to the repurchase of million shares of common stock during offset somewhat by the issuance of million shares in partial payment of the sibley industries  inc and staco  inc acquisitions

at december   poultry building construction costs in excess of billings were down by million from the prior year end

the company s net sales and net income have historically been lower during the first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third quarters when distributors and dealers increase purchases to meet the seasonal demand of end users

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  but does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
principal exposed to interest rate risk at december   is million in variable rate debt exclusive of amounts covered by interest rate swap agreements 
the company measures its interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which potential future net earnings would be impacted by hypothetical changes in market interest rates related to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates as of december   the estimated reduction in earnings  net of tax  is expected to be approximately million 
the company utilizes foreign exchange contracts to minimize its exposure to currency risk for the payment of its interest obligations on non us dollar denominated debt 
foreign currency payments are received periodically from its foreign subsidiaries to permit repayment of non us dollar denominated debt owed by the parent company 
upon receipt  forward contracts are purchased as a hedge against exchange rate fluctuations that may occur between the receipt date and the interest payment due date 
the company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities in the markets it serves and by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products 
the company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates primarily to us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
the company s exposure related to such transactions is not material to cash flows 
however  exposure related to such transactions to the company s financial position and results of operations is anticipated to be adversely impacted by approximately  net of tax  for every devaluation of the brazilian real per us dollar and approximately  net of tax  for every depreciation of the euro and its fixed legacy currencies arising from multiple intercompany loans among the company and its european subsidiaries 
these amounts are estimates only and are difficult to accurately project due to factors such as the inherent fluctuation of intercompany account balances and the existing economic uncertainty and unpredictable future economic conditions in the international marketplace
