the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
euro conversion on january   the european economic and monetary union emu entered a three year transition phase during which a new common currency  the euro  was introduced in participating countries which established fixed conversion rates through the european central bank ecb between existing local currencies and the euro 
from that date  the euro is traded on currency exchanges 
following introduction of the euro  local currencies will remain legal tender until december  during this transition period  goods and services may be paid for with the euro or the local currency under the emu s no compulsion  no prohibition principle 
france was a participating country in the first group to adopt the emu  which effects the company s french operations 
the uk is currently not a part of the emu 
based on its evaluation to date  management believes that the introduction of the euro will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro will have on the marketplace  and there is no guarantee that all issues will be foreseen and corrected or that other third parties will address the conversion successfully 
the company has reviewed its information systems software and identified modifications necessary to ensure business transactions can be conducted consistent with the requirements of the conversion to the euro 
certain of these modifications have been implemented  and others will be implemented during the course of the transition period 
the company expects that modifications not yet implemented will be made on a timely basis and expects the incremental cost of the euro conversion to be immaterial 
any costs associated with implementing changes to comply with the euro conversion are expensed as incurred 
the euro introduction did not have a material impact on the company s overall currency risk 
the company anticipates the euro will simplify financial issues related to cross border trade in the emu and reduce the transaction costs and administrative time necessary to manage this trade and related risks 
however  the company believes that the associated savings will not be material to corporate results 
pending accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
deferred the effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after june  because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk as a result of foreign sales a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  the uk and france 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the us or us subsidiaries of the company distributes its products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company regularly hedges by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately of its future net foreign currency sales transactions over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts related to sales  however there was an exchange contract of  relating to a short term inter company cash transfer 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
exposure to exchange rates as a result of foreign sales the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately in european countries  as a result of the sales of its products in foreign markets 
foreign currency options and forward contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of  for the year ending december  comparatively  at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of  for the year ended december  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the translation adjustment during was a loss of  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and the french franc closed at 
relative to british pound 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and the french franc closed at 
relative to british pound 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or french franc or how further movements in those currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk at december  the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such actions 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
