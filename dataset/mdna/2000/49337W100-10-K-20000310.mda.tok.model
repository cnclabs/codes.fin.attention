the company s other energy activities include gas exploration and production  primarily through the houston exploration company thec  domestic pipelines and storage  and international activities  including gas processing in canada  and gas pipelines and local distribution in northern ireland 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  business segments for additional information on each operating segment 
the company was formed on may  as a result of a transaction between long island lighting company lilco and lipa the lipa transaction and following the acquisition the keyspan acquisition of keyspan energy corporation kse 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  sale of lilco assets  acquisition of keyspan energy corporation and transfer of assets and liabilities to the company for additional information 
on november   the company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the common stock of eastern enterprises eastern 
eastern is a holding company that owns and operates  primarily  boston gas company  colonial gas company  essex gas company and midland enterprises  inc eastern has also entered into an agreement to acquire all of the common stock of energynorth  a provider of gas distribution services to customers in new hampshire

see note to the consolidated financial statements  acquisition of eastern enterprises for further details 
current period consolidated results of operations are reported for the year ended december  in the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december therefore  results of operations for the period ended december  reflect the nine month transition period april  to december  the transition period 
the transition period consists of the following i the period april  through may   which reflects the results of lilco only prior to the lipa transaction and keyspan acquisition  and ii the period may  through december   which represents the results of the fully consolidated company  which includes the kse acquired companies  ie the brooklyn union gas company brooklyn union and subsidiaries comprising the gas exploration and production  energy related services and energy related investment segments 
as required under purchase accounting  the results of operations for all periods prior to may  reflect results of lilco only  and do not include results of kse 
due to the change in the composition of the company s operations and the change in the company s fiscal year  both occurring in  results of operations for the year ended december   for the transition period  and for the fiscal year ended march  are not truly comparable for the following reasons 
prior to the lipa transaction  lilco provided fully integrated electric service to its customers 
included within electric rates charged to customers was a return on the capital investment in the generation and the transmission and distribution t d assets  as well as recovery of the electric business costs to operate the system 
upon completion of the lipa transaction  the nature of the company s electric business changed from that of owner of an electric generation and t d system  with significant capital investment  to a new role as owner of the non nuclear generation facilities and as manager of the t d system now owned by lipa 
in its new role  the company s capital investment is significantly reduced and accordingly  its revenues under various service contracts with lipa reflect that reduction 
also contributing to the non comparability between reporting periods  is the integration of the kse acquired companies since may  the kse acquired companies  which include the gas distribution operations of brooklyn union  contribute significantly to results of operations 
income available for common stock for the kse acquired companies  for the period january  through may  was million and is not reflected in results of operations for the transition period 
the change in the company s fiscal year also contributed significantly to the non comparability between reporting periods 
as previously mentioned  results of operations for the transition period reflect results for the period april  through december  as a result  the transition period does not reflect earnings from gas heating season operations 
the company realizes approximately of its gas distribution related earnings  or approximately of its consolidated earnings  during the months of january through march  due to the large percentage of gas heating sales to total gas sales 
since the reporting periods are not truly comparable we have provided  in addition to the discussion of the results of operations between periods that follows  a discussion of operating results for each business segment for the year ended december  compared to the full twelve months ended december  the intent of this additional disclosure is to provide a better explanation of the variations in operating results between two comparable twelve month periods for the company s on going business activities 
see segment review of operations combined company comparison 
the commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated review of historical results earnings summary consolidated earnings for were million  or per share 
consolidated results for the transition period reflected a loss of million  or per share 
during the transition period  the company i incurred substantial non recurring charges associated with the lipa transaction of million after tax  or per share  principally reflecting taxes associated with the sale of assets to the company by lipa and the write off of certain regulatory assets that were no longer recoverable under various lipa agreements  ii incurred charges amounting to million after tax  or per share  associated with implementing an early retirement program and charges associated with the write off of a customer billing system that was in development  iii made a million donation million after tax  or per share to establish the keyspan foundation  and iv recorded an after tax non cash impairment charge of million  or per share  representing the company s share of the impairment charge recorded by thec to recognize the effect of low wellhead prices on its valuation of proved gas reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  costs related to the lipa transaction and special charges for further details of these charges 
excluding these non recurring and special charges  earnings for the transition period were million  or per share 
earnings for the twelve months ended march  were million  or per share  and as noted above  reflect results of operations of the former lilco only 
consolidated income loss available for common stock by reporting segment is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated in thousands of dollars transition period april  through december  fiscal year year ended subsequent ended december  prior to the to the march  acquisition acquisition total income loss available for common stock gas distribution      electric services      gas exploration and production    energy related services    energy related investments    other    consolidated      special charges  consolidated including  special charges the increase in gas distribution earnings in as compared to the transition period and the fiscal year ended march   reflects  primarily  the addition of brooklyn union from the date of the keyspan acquisition 
brooklyn union s income available for common stock in was million 
further  earnings for the transition period do not include earnings from heating season operations months of january through march when the company realizes approximately of its gas related earnings 
the decrease in earnings for the transition period as compared to the fiscal year ended march  is also due to the absence of heating season operations associated with lilco s gas distribution operations during the transition period 
in  earnings from electric services reflect service fees under various service contracts with lipa and earnings from the operations of the company s investment in the  megawatt ravenswood electric generation facility  ravenswood facility located in queens  new york  purchased in june in order to reduce its cash requirements  the company entered into a lease agreement with a special purpose  unaffiliated financing entity that acquired a portion of the ravenswood facility and leased it to a subsidiary of the company under a ten year lease 
electric services earnings increased in as compared to the transition period due  primarily to the acquisition of the ravenswood facility which contributed million to electric services earnings in further  results reflect a full twelve month period of earnings from the service contracts with lipa 
for additional details on the electric revenues and the ravenswood facility see electric services revenue mechanisms and note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  and contingencies  respectively 
as previously mentioned  the company s operating results under its arrangements with lipa are significantly lower than those experienced prior to the lipa transaction  reflecting the change in the nature of the company s electric business 
as a result  earnings subsequent to the lipa transaction reflect these reduced margins  therefore  earnings for and the transition period are significantly lower than those experienced for the fiscal year ended march  results of operations in from gas exploration and production  energy related services  and energy related investments reflect operations for a full twelve months as compared to seven months for the transition period 
earnings from gas exploration and production operations in have benefited from the combined effect of increases in gas production volumes and gas prices 
results of operations in from energy related services and energy related investments reflect the continued development and integration of companies acquired over the past few years 
losses from the other segment reflect preferred stock dividends and general expenses incurred by the corporate and administrative areas of the company that have not been allocated to the various business segments  offset  in part  by interest income earned on temporary cash investments 
interest income has been decreasing as the company continues to use cash to finance acquisitions  repurchase shares of its common stock  and retire maturing debt 
revenues consolidated revenues are derived  primarily  from the company s two core operating segments gas distribution and electric services 
in  these two core segments accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues 
the increase in consolidated revenues of billion  or  in  as compared to the transition period  reflects  primarily  revenues from gas heating sales 
for the months of january through march  gas distribution revenues were million or approximately of total gas distribution revenues for the entire year 
the transition period  which reflects the period april  through december   does not include revenues from heating season operations for the months of january through march 
further  revenues in reflect a full twelve month period for all segments  whereas the transition period reflects revenues for only seven months from the kse acquired companies 
revenues in also include million of revenues from the ravenswood facility and were further enhanced from the acquisition of companies reflected in the energy related services segment 
consolidated revenues for the transition period decreased by billion  or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  due to the significant reduction in electric revenues 
electric revenues for the transition period were derived from service agreements with lipa for the period may  through december  and two months of electric services under lilco 
as previously mentioned  prior to the lipa transaction  lilco provided fully integrated electric service to its customers 
included within electric rates charged to customers was a return on the capital investment in the generation and t d assets  as well as recovery of the electric business costs to operate the system 
upon completion of the lipa transaction  the company s capital investment was significantly reduced and accordingly  its revenues under the lipa contracts reflect that reduction 
this change in the nature of the company s electric operations also contributed to the comparative decrease in revenues for as compared to the fiscal year ended march  see segment review of operations combined company comparison for additional information regarding revenues for each segment 
operating expenses operating expenses were billion in  and billion and billion for the transition period and fiscal year ended march   respectively 
the increase in as compared to the transition period of million  or  is due  in part  to the increased reporting time frame and to an increase of million in operations and maintenance expense reflecting  primarily  the addition of the kse acquired companies 
the decrease in operating expenses for the transition period as compared to the fiscal year ended march  of million or  is due  primarily to the shorter reporting period and the discontinuance of fuel and purchased power expense associated with the electric generating facilities on long island  offset  in part  by operations and maintenance expenses of the kse acquired companies 
purchased gas variations in gas costs have little impact on operating results as the current gas rate structure of each of the company s two gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs and gas cost recoveries are deferred and subsequently refunded to  or collected from customers 
comparative variations between the reported periods are due to the addition of the kse acquired companies  changes in gas volumes and prices  and the differences in the reporting periods presented 
fuel and purchased power electric fuel expense was million in  and million and million for the transition period and for the fiscal year ended march   respectively 
in accordance with the energy management agreement ema between the company and lipa  lipa is responsible for paying directly the costs of fuel  as well as purchased power to satisfy the energy needs of lipa s customers 
as a result  since may   the company no longer incurs any electric fuel expense for long island generation or purchased power expense 
electric fuel expense for reflects fuel purchases to operate the ravenswood facility 
operations and maintenance expense operations and maintenance expense was billion in  and million and million for the transition period and fiscal year ended march   respectively 
the increase in all periods was due primarily to the addition of the kse acquired companies 
operations and maintenance expense for these companies was million for and million for the transition period 
further  the increase in comparative operations and maintenance expense in was due  in part  to the operations of the ravenswood facility  which added million to expense 
operations and maintenance expense for the transition period included million of costs associated with the write off of a customer billing system that was in development and a charge of million associated with an early retirement program 
on a comparable twelve month basis however  the company has realized significant reductions in operations and maintenance expense derived  in part  from cost reduction measures and operating efficiencies employed during the past few years 
to gain a better perspective of operations and maintenance expense on a comparable twelve month basis see segment review of operations combined company comparison 
electric regulatory amortizations prior to the lipa transaction  the rate moderation component rmc  included within electric regulatory amortizations  represented the difference between lilco s revenue requirements under conventional ratemaking and the revenues provided by its electric rate structure 
in april  the new york public service commission nypsc authorized a revision  effective december   to lilco s method of recording its monthly rmc amortization 
as a result of this change  for the period april  through may   lilco recorded million more of non cash rmc credits to income  or million after tax  than it would have under the previous method 
in addition  for the fiscal year ended march   lilco recorded approximately million more of non cash rmc credits to income  or million after tax  than it would have under the previous method 
in connection with the lipa transaction  which included the sale of all electric related regulatory assets  the rmc and all other electric regulatory amortizations were discontinued 
other operating expenses depreciation and depletion expense reflects gas utility property and electric generation property additions for all periods and electric t d property additions for the periods prior to the lipa transaction 
in addition  depreciation and depletion expense in and for the transition period  includes depletion expense associated with the gas production activities of thec 
the decrease in depreciation and depletion expense in as compared to the transition period is due  primarily  to the fact that thec recorded an impairment charge of million in december to reduce the value of its proved gas reserves in accordance with the asset ceiling test limitations of the sec applicable to gas exploration and development operations accounted for under the full cost method 
excluding this impairment charge  depreciation expense increased in all periods due to property additions and the addition of the kse acquired companies 
offsetting these increases  in part  is the effect on depreciation expense from the sale of significant property related assets to lipa as a result of the lipa transaction 
operating taxes principally include state and local taxes on utility revenues and property 
the applicable property base and tax rates generally have increased in all periods 
the increase in operating taxes in  as compared to the transition period  reflects the addition of the kse acquired companies for a full twelve month period  and operating taxes associated with the ravenswood facility 
operating taxes associated with the kse acquired companies was million in and million during the transition period 
the ravenswood facility had operating taxes of million in significant property related assets were sold to lipa as part of the lipa transaction and  as a result  subsequent to may   property taxes related to such assets are no longer incurred by the company 
therefore  operating taxes in and for the transition period are significantly lower than for the fiscal year ended march  other income and deductions other income includes equity earnings from subsidiaries comprising the energy related investments segment  primarily the company s interest in the iroquois gas transmission system lp iroquois and investment in gulf midstream services partnership gms 
in addition  other income also includes interest income from temporary cash investments 
equity earnings in reflect twelve months of results for iroquois as compared to only seven months of results for the transition period 
further  gms was acquired in december and  therefore  there are no equity earnings associated with gms for the transition period 
the company recognized equity earnings of million and million for  from its investment in iroquois and gms  respectively 
interest income has decreased in  as compared to the transition period  as the company continues to use cash to make acquisitions  repurchase shares of its common stock  and retire maturing debt 
other income and deductions also includes the minority interest effect associated with the company s ownership interest in thec 
other income and deductions for the transition period reflects non recurring charges associated with the lipa transaction of million after tax and a million before tax charge for the funding of the keyspan foundation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  costs related to the lipa transaction and special charges 
other income and deductions for the fiscal year ended march  primarily includes a charge of million before tax with respect to certain benefits earned by former officers of lilco offset by carrying charges on certain electric regulatory assets resulting from electric ratemaking mechanisms that have been discontinued due to the lipa transaction 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense in and for the transition period  as compared to the fiscal year ended march   primarily reflects the significantly reduced level of outstanding debt resulting from the lipa transaction 
upon consummation of the lipa transaction  lipa assumed substantially all of the outstanding debt of lilco 
the company  in return  issued promissory notes to lipa for its continuing obligation to pay principal and interest on certain series of bonds that were assumed by lipa 
outstanding debt at december  was billion as compared to billion lilco only prior to the lipa transaction 
in addition  interest expense in also reflects the repayment of million of promissory notes due lipa that matured in june the reduction in interest expense in from the lower levels of debt outstanding was offset  in part  by the interest expense from the kse acquired companies for the full twelve months 
income taxes income tax expense reflects the level of pre tax income in all periods and for  an adjustment to deferred tax expense and current tax expense for the utilization of previously deferred net operating loss nol carryforwards recorded in in the transition period  the company recorded  as a deferred tax asset  a benefit of million for nol carryforwards 
the company estimates that million of the benefits from the nol carryforwards from will be realized in its consolidated federal and state income tax returns  and accordingly  applied the nol benefits in its federal and state tax provisions 
pre tax income and the related deferred income tax expense for the transition period were significantly affected by charges related to the lipa transaction  the write off of a customer billing system  charges related to the early retirement program  and the impairment charge associated with the write down of proved gas reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  income tax 
segment review of operations combined company comparison due to the change in the structure of the company s electric business as a result of the lipa transaction and the requirements of purchase accounting applicable to the keyspan acquisition as discussed previously  results of operations for are not truly comparable to the results of operations for the transition period 
for comparative purposes  we have combined the results of operations  excluding non recurring and special charges  of kse and lilco for the entire twelve month period ended december  this combined presentation is intended to reflect the results of the company as if the keyspan acquisition occurred on the first day of the reporting period  january  this combined company basis format will also be used to explain variations in operating results  for each business segment  between the twelve months ended december  and consolidated income loss available for common stock  on a combined company basis excluding non recurring and special charges  by reporting segment is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated in thousands of dollars combined company year ended twelve months ended december  december  income loss available for common stock gas distribution   electric services   gas exploration and production   energy related services   energy related investments   other   reflects the lipa service agreements for the period may  through december  and electric operations of the former lilco for the period january  through may gas distribution with the exception of a small portion of queens county  the company s gas distribution subsidiaries are the only providers of gas distribution services in the new york city counties of kings  richmond and queens and the long island counties of nassau and suffolk 
brooklyn union provides gas distribution services to customers in the new york city boroughs of brooklyn  queens and staten island  and keyspan gas east corporation d b a brooklyn union of long island brooklyn union of long island  provides gas distribution services to customers in the long island counties of nassau and suffolk and the rockaway peninsula of queens county 
the table below highlights certain significant financial data and operating statistics for the gas distribution segment for the periods indicated 
in thousands of dollars combined company year ended twelve months ended december  december  revenues   cost of gas   revenue taxes   net revenues   operations and maintenance   depreciation and amortization   operating taxes   total operating expenses   operating income   earnings for common stock   firm gas sales mdth   firm transportation mdth   transportation electric generation mdth   other sales mdth   degree days   warmer than normal net revenues net gas revenues decreased in by million  or  due primarily  to rate reductions associated with the keyspan acquisition 
brooklyn union reduced rates to its core customers by million on an annual basis effective may  and brooklyn union of long island reduced its rates to core customers by million annually effective february  and by an additional million annually effective may  for the year ended december   rate reductions impacted revenues by approximately million as compared to firm sales quantities  normalized for weather variations  increased by  contributing approximately million to net revenues 
firm sales additions were generated primarily on long island from the addition of new gas customers and oil to gas conversions 
weather normalized firm sales on long island increased by and by in the company s new york city service area 
long island has a very low natural gas saturation rate and significant gas sales growth opportunities remain available 
the company estimates that only of one and two family homes on long island currently use natural gas for space heating  while of the multi family market and of the commercial market use gas for space heating 
in this service area  the company will seek growth through the expansion of its distribution system as well as through the conversion of residential homes and the pursuit of opportunities to grow multi family  industrial and commercial markets 
in the company s service area of the new york city boroughs of brooklyn  queens and staten island  of one and two family homes currently use gas for space heating  while of the multi family market and of the commercial market use gas for space heating 
in these areas  the company intends to seek growth with an aggressive marketing effort designed to encourage conversions of residential and multi family homes and businesses from fuel oil to natural gas heating 
in the large volume heating markets  which include large apartment houses  government buildings and schools  gas service is provided under rates that are set to compete with prices of alternative fuel  including no 
and no 
grade heating oil 
during  gas generally sold at a premium to heating oil 
however  due to the recent increase in the price of heating grade fuel oil  gas is currently selling at a discount to heating oil 
the company increased sales in this market in  by approximately million  through aggressive unit pricing and the addition of new customers 
contributing to the reduction in comparative net margins in was a decrease in certain regulatory incentives earned by the company  offset  in part  by revenue benefits associated with colder weather 
further  since april  net revenues no longer reflect revenues derived from brooklyn union s appliance and repair services since these services have been spun off to another company subsidiary and are now reflected in the energy related services segment 
sales  transportation and other volumes comparative firm gas sales volumes increased by in  due to the increase in normalized firm sales  as discussed above  and the benefits derived from colder weather in as compared to firm gas transportation volumes also increased in  as a result of natural gas deregulation initiatives 
at december   approximately  residential  commercial and industrial customers  with annual requirements of approximately  mdth  or of the company s annual firm gas system requirements  purchased their gas supply from sources other than the company  as compared to  customers with annual requirements of approximately  mdth in the company s net margins are not affected by customers opting to purchase their gas supply from sources other than the company  since distribution rates charged to transportation customers are the same as those charged to sales customers 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of competitive issues facing the company 
transportation volumes related to electric generation  reflect the transportation of gas to the company s electric generating facilities located on long island 
the company began reporting these volumes since the lipa transaction 
net revenues from these volumes are marginal 
other sales volumes include on system interruptible volumes  off system sales volumes sales made to customers outside of the company s service territories and related transportation 
the decrease in these sales reflects  primarily  the fact that brooklyn union discontinued its off system sales program beginning april  and replaced it with a management agreement with enron capital and trade resources corp 
and its parent company  enron corp 
collectively  enron  in which enron pays the company a fixed fee in exchange for the right granted enron to earn revenues based upon its management of brooklyn union s gas supply requirements  storage arrangements  and off system capacity 
this agreement expires on march  the company currently is in negotiations with a large energy corporation to provide energy supply management services to both brooklyn union and brooklyn union of long island beginning on april  operating expenses comparative operating expenses decreased in by million  or 
during the year  the company realized significant reductions in operations and maintenance expense reflecting  primarily  the benefits derived from cost reduction measures and operating efficiencies employed during the past few years 
such measures included  but were not limited to  the early retirement program completed in  in which over employees participated 
the company intends to continue its on going cost containment initiatives and anticipates further reductions in operations and maintenance expenses in in addition  brooklyn union s spin off of non safety related appliance repair services to keyspan energy solutions llc  a company subsidiary  in april contributed to the reduction in operations and maintenance expense for this segment 
brooklyn union of long island discontinued providing non safety related appliance repair services on july   further reducing operating expenses for this segment 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects continued property additions and  more significantly  amortization of previously deferred merger related expenses 
as provided for in the stipulation agreement  which in effect approved the keyspan acquisition  the company s gas distribution subsidiaries deferred certain merger related costs at the time of the merger 
these costs are being amortized over a ten year period 
see gas distribution rate matters for further details on the stipulation agreement 
further  operating taxes which include state and local taxes on property have increased as the applicable property base and tax rates generally have increased 
earnings earnings increased in by million  or due primarily  to the net result of the aforementioned items 
in addition  earnings were favorably affected by carrying charges on certain regulatory deferrals previously mentioned and lower interest expense 
electric services the electric services segment primarily consists of subsidiaries that own and operate oil and gas fired generating plants in queens and long island  and through long term contracts  manage the electric t d system  the fuel and electric purchases  and the off system electric sales for lipa 
prior to the lipa transaction  lilco provided fully integrated electric distribution services to over one million customers on long island 
selected financial data for the electric services segment is set forth in the table below for the periods indicated 
in thousands of dollars electric electric services electric services distribution january  combined company year ended may  through through twelve months ended december  december  may  december  revenues management services agreement msa    power supply agreement psa    energy management agreement ema    ravenswood facility  electric distribution   other  total revenues     operating expenses fuel and purchased power    operations and maintenance     depreciation     regulatory amortizations   operating taxes     total operating expenses     operating income     earnings for common stock     revenues revenues related to the lipa service contracts have increased in  as compared to the transition period  due primarily  to the fact that reflects a full year of operations under these contracts 
in addition in  the company earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  as compared to the maximum incentive level of million 
see electric services revenue mechanisms lipa agreements for a further description of these agreements 
revenues were further enhanced in by the operations of the ravenswood facility 
total revenues in  however  decreased by million  or  as compared to as previously indicated  in addition to revenues from the ravenswood facility  electric revenues are also derived from service agreements with lipa 
as a result of the change in the nature of the company s electric operations due to the lipa transaction  the company s electric capital investment has been significantly reduced and accordingly  its revenues and margins under the lipa contracts reflect that reduction 
operating expenses operating expenses in decreased by million  or  compared to  reflecting primarily  the discontinuance of fuel and purchased power expense associated with the generating facilities located on long island 
in accordance with the ema  lipa is responsible for paying directly the costs of fuel  as well as purchased power to satisfy lipa s customers 
as a result  the company since may  no longer incurs any electric fuel expense for long island generation or purchased power expense 
further  depreciation expense and operating taxes have also decreased in due to the sale of significant property related assets to lipa as a result of the lipa transaction 
offsetting these reductions is the discontinuance of certain electric regulatory amortizations  as previously discussed  and an increase in operations and maintenance expense 
since the lipa transaction  operations and maintenance expense includes the costs associated with the management of the t d assets acquired by lipa 
all t d related costs are expensed when incurred and recovered from lipa through monthly billings in accordance with the terms of the management services agreement entered into between the company and lipa 
prior to the lipa transaction  all t d related construction costs were capitalized and charged to depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
earnings in addition to the effect on earnings from the above mentioned items  earnings in were favorably affected by a decrease of million in interest expense reflecting the significantly reduced level of outstanding debt resulting from the lipa transaction 
further  prior to the keyspan acquisition  approximately million of preferred stock dividends were allocated to electric operations 
partially offsetting these benefits was the elimination of carrying charges on certain electric regulatory assets resulting from electric ratemaking mechanisms that have been discontinued due to the lipa transaction 
gas exploration and production the gas exploration and production segment is engaged in gas and oil exploration and production  and the development and acquisition of domestic natural gas and oil properties 
this segment consists  primarily  of the company s equity interest in thec 
in september  the company and thec jointly announced their intention to begin a process to review strategic alternatives for thec 
the process included an assessment of the role of thec within the company s strategic plans  including the possible sale of all or a portion of thec by the company 
after completing the review  the company concluded that it would retain its equity interest in thec 
further  under a pre existing credit arrangement  approximately million in debt owed by thec to the company will be converted into common equity on april  the company s common equity ownership interest in thec will increase to approximately upon such conversion 
selected financial data and operating statistics for the gas exploration and production segment are set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
in thousands of dollars combined company twelve months year ended ended december  december  revenues   operating expenses   operating income   earnings for common stock   production data natural gas production mmcf   natural gas per mcf realized proved reserves at year end bcfe excludes an after tax charge of million representing the company s share of an impairment charge to reduce the value of proved gas reserves 
operating income operating income increased by million  or  in as compared to  due to higher revenues and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in operating expenses 
revenues in reflect the benefits derived from a increase in production volumes  combined with an increase in average realized gas prices average wellhead price received for production including hedging gains and losses 
at december   thec had bcfe of net proved reserves of natural gas  of which was classified as proved developed 
the comparative decrease in operating expenses in was largely due to a lower depletion rate resulting  primarily  from the ceiling test write down in earnings operating income above represents of thec s actual results for and  excluding the impairment charge 
earnings however  reflect the company s ownership interest 
this principally accounts for the difference between operating income and earnings 
additionally  thec incurred million more in interest expense in due to higher levels of debt outstanding 
energy related services the company s energy related services segment primarily includes keyspan energy management inc kem  keyspan energy services inc 
kes  keyspan communications corporation  keyspan energy solutions  llc kesol  fritze keyspan  llc fritze  and delta keyspan inc delta 
these subsidiaries own  design and or operate energy systems for commercial and industrial customers and provide energy related appliance services and heating  ventilation and air conditioning system installation and maintenance services to residential and commercial clients located primarily within the new york city metropolitan area and rhode island 
in addition  subsidiaries in this segment market gas and electricity  and arrange transportation and related services  largely to retail customers  including those served by the company s two gas distribution subsidiaries  and own a fiber optic network on long island 
kesol was established in april  fritze was acquired in november and delta was acquired in september the table below highlights selected financial information for the energy related services segment 
in thousands of dollars combined company twelve months year ended ended december  december  revenues   operating expenses   operating loss   loss for common stock   the decrease in the loss in as compared to  is due to an increase in revenues of  offset  in part  by an increase in operating expenses of 
the increase in comparative revenues was due  in part  to the inclusion of revenues from fritze for a full twelve month period 
fritze contributed million to the increase in segment revenues in delta  the company s newly acquired heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac contractor  contributed revenues of million in further  the combined revenues from kem  kes and kesol increased by million in  due to the benefits derived from companies acquired during the past two years and the growth in the number of customers purchasing energy from kes and services from kesol 
the comparative increase in operating expenses for both periods  was due primarily  to the acquisition of fritze and delta  the integration of operations of other companies acquired during the past few years  and increased purchased gas costs of kes necessary to serve a larger customer base 
the formation and commencement of operations of kesol  in april  also contributed to the comparative increase in operating expenses in the company has been successful in integrating the operations of its recently acquired companies into its consolidated operations 
fritze  delta and other energy management operations posted profitable results in kes and kesol both incurred losses in  as both companies seek to establish significant market penetration 
gas deregulation of commodity purchases in the northeast is still in its infancy and gas sales margins have remained slim  contributing to the loss incurred by kes 
in february  the company acquired three companies that provide energy related services in the new york metropolitan area with combined revenues of approximately million 
the newly acquired companies include  an engineering consulting firm  a plumbing and mechanical contracting firm  and a firm specializing in mechanical contracting and hvac 
energy related investments earnings for this segment are derived  primarily  from the company s interest in the iroquois gas transmission system lp  ownership interest in gulf midstream services partnership gms  and interest in the premier transco pipeline and a interest in phoenix natural gas  both in northern ireland 
comparative earnings from this segment increased by million in  reflecting  primarily  earnings from the company s investment in gms  formed in december  and more favorable results from investments in northern ireland

accordingly  equity income from these investments is reflected in other income and deductions in the consolidated statement of income 
other the other segment incurred a loss of million in compared to income of million in and  generally  reflects preferred stock dividends and charges incurred by the corporate and administrative areas of the company that have not been allocated to the various business segments  offset  in part  by interest income earned on temporary cash investments 
interest income has been decreasing as the company continues to utilize cash to finance certain acquisitions  repurchase shares of its common stock  and retire maturing debt 
also  all preferred stock dividends were allocated to the other segment in  whereas  prior to the lipa transaction preferred stock dividends were allocated to gas and electric operations 
future outlook results of operations for reflect strong results from the company s core gas distribution operations 
these results reflect gas sales growth  primarily on long island  as the benefits from the company s gas expansion initiatives begin to be realized 
gas sales growth on long island was approximately in  after normalizing for weather variations 
moreover  ongoing synergy programs have proven to be successful 
in addition  the company s june acquisition of the ravenswood facility provided the company with significant earnings enhancement 
results from operations of the ravenswood facility contributed per share to consolidated earnings in finally  the successful integration of companies purchased by the energy related services segment are expected to form the basis for additional benefits to consolidated earnings in future years 
for  the company intends to continue its gas distribution growth activities throughout its service territory  and especially on long island  through the conversion of residential homes and the pursuit of opportunities to grow multi family  industrial and commercial markets 
gas sales growth throughout the company s service territory in  is anticipated to grow at approximately the same rate as as the company evolves within the new deregulated gas environment  gas sales growth will remain a critical core strategy 
the company sells gas to its firm customers at the company s cost for such gas 
in addition  rates include a charge to recover the costs of distribution  including a profit margin for return of and on invested capital 
as the company adds customers to its gas distribution network  the company s gross profit margin from transportation sales should increase incrementally 
as a result  customer additions are and will remain critical to the company s earnings enhancement in the future  regardless of whether a customer purchases gas from the company or a third party supplier 
further  the company intends to grow its energy related services operations in order to deliver an extensive array of home energy related services and business solutions to a broad spectrum of customers 
these operations are expected to be enhanced through the acquisition of companies providing energy related services 
in line with this strategy  as previously mentioned  the company acquired three additional companies  in february that provide energy related services 
a key component in the company s strategy for growth in the northeast region is its anticipated acquisition of eastern 
in november  the company announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with eastern under which the company will acquire all of the common stock of eastern 
eastern is the largest natural gas distribution company in new england with significant upside potential due to the relatively low penetration of customers using gas for heat in the region 
the northeast region represents a significant portion of the country s population and energy consumption 
with recent price spikes for fuel oil in the northeast  the company anticipates even stronger demand for natural gas and related services 
together  keyspan and eastern will have approximately million customers making the new company the largest gas distribution company in the northeast 
further  the company expects pre tax annual synergy savings to be approximately million 
the transaction  which will be accounted for as a purchase  is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of calendar year upon consummation of the transaction  the company will become a registered holding company under the public utility holding company act of  as amended

in  the company anticipates continued earnings growth in core gas distribution operations  full annual benefits from the ravenswood facility  continued successful integration of companies providing energy related services and gas sales growth from the acquisition of eastern 
to ensure that its assets are utilized in the most effective manner  the company will continue to review and evaluate the strategic nature of all its assets deployed 
liquidity  capital expenditures and financing  and dividends liquidity the increase in cash flow from operations in as compared to the transition period  reflects the significant positive cash flows that are realized from revenues generated during a heating season  continued strong results from core utility operations  cash generated from the ravenswood facility  and the benefits derived from the integration of kse acquired companies for an entire twelve month period 
approximately of total annual gas revenues are realized during the heating season november to april as a result of the large proportion of heating sales compared to total gas sales 
results from gas heating season operations are not reflected in the transition period  as previously explained 
further  cash flow from operations in reflects the utilization of a million nol on income tax payments for  as previously discussed 
moreover  during the transition period  million was funded into voluntary employee beneficiary trusts to fund certain employee postretirement welfare benefits and  as a result  cash flow from operations for the transition period was adversely affected 
the slight decrease in cash flow from operations in as compared to the fiscal year ended march   reflects  primarily  lower margins realized from electric operations due to the lipa transaction  as previously discussed  offset  in part  by increased cash flows from kse acquired companies and utilization of the nol

annual service incentives or penalties exist under the msa if certain targets are achieved or not achieved 
in addition  the company can earn certain incentives for cost reductions associated with the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of lipa s t d system 
these incentives provide for the company to i retain of cost reductions on the first million in reductions  and ii retain of additional cost reductions up to of the total cost budget  thereafter all savings will accrue to lipa 
with respect to cost overruns  the company will absorb the first million of overruns  with a sharing of overruns above million 
there are certain limitations on the amount of cost sharing of overruns 
to date  the company has performed its obligations under the msa within the agreed to budget guidelines and the company is committed to providing on going services to lipa within the established cost structure 
however  no assurances can be given as to future operating results under this agreement 
power supply agreement psa a company subsidiary sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy from the company s existing oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy are made under rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the rates may be modified in the future in accordance with the terms of the psa for i agreed upon labor and expense indices applied to the base year  ii a return of and on net capital additions required for the generating facilities  and iii reasonably incurred expenses that are outside the control of the company 
rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly basis and is dependent on the amount of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy from the company and is able to purchase energy on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
the company must  therefore  operate its generating facilities in a manner such that the company can remain competitive with other producers of energy 
to date  the company has dispatched to lipa and lipa has accepted the level of energy generated at the agreed to price per megawatt hour 
however  no assurances can be given as to the level and price of energy to be dispatched to lipa in the future 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability of the generating facilities 
the psa runs for a term of fifteen years

ravenswood facility at the time of the company s purchase of the ravenswood facility  the company and con edison entered into energy and capacity contracts 
the energy contract provided con edison with of the energy produced by the ravenswood facility and covered a period of time from the date of closing  june   through november  with the start up of the new york independent system operator nyiso the electricity market in new york city began a transition to a competitive market for capacity  energy and ancillary services 
starting on november   the company began selling the energy produced by the ravenswood facility through daily and or hourly bidding into the nyiso energy markets 
the company also has the option to sell all or a portion of the energy produced by the ravenswood facility to load serving entities lse  ie entities that sell to end users 
at this point in time  the company has sold energy exclusively through the nyiso 
the capacity contract  which is still in effect  provides con edison with of the available capacity of the ravenswood facility 
the company anticipates that this contract will expire on april   at which time the available capacity of the ravenswood facility will be bid into on the auction process conducted by the nyiso 
the company also has the option to sell the capacity through contracts with lses 
it is anticipated that in  at least of the net profit margins from the ravenswood facility will be derived from capacity sales through either the auction process associated with the nyiso or contracts with lses

nevertheless  the company continues to monitor systems for any unexpected year related abnormalities 
the company has spent a total of approximately million to address the year issue 
while the year project is virtually complete  some minor expenses will be incurred for the continued review of systems to monitor for year abnormalities 
the largest portion of the year costs was attributable to the assessment  modification  and testing of corporate information technology it supported computer software and in house written applications 
the company s implementation of the year project did not directly result in delaying any it projects 
the company s cash flow from operations and cash on hand have been sufficient to fund the year project expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various risk exposures and uncertainties associated with their operations 
the most significant contingency involves the evolution of the gas distribution industry toward a more competitive and deregulated environment 
most important to the company  is the evolution of regulatory policy as it pertains to the company s fixed charges associated with its firm gas purchase contracts related to its historical gas merchant role 
in addition  the company is exposed to commodity price risk  interest rate risk and  to a much less degree  foreign currency translation risk 
set forth below is a description of these exposures and an explanation as to how the company and its subsidiaries have managed and  to the extent possible  sought to reduce these risks 
regulatory issues and the competitive environment the gas industry the energy industry continues to undergo fundamental changes  which may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of utilities  as regulatory authorities  elected officials and customers seek lower energy prices and broader choices 
over the past few years  the nypsc has been formulating a policy framework to guide the transition of new york state s gas distribution industry in the deregulated gas industry environment 
since  customers in the small volume market have been given the option to purchase their gas supplies from sources other than the company s two gas utility subsidiaries 
large volume customers had this option for a number of years prior to in addition to transporting gas that customers purchase from marketers  the company s utilities have been providing billing  meter reading and other services for aggregate rates that match the distribution charge reflected in otherwise applicable sales rates to supply these customers 
in november  the nypsc issued a policy statement setting forth its vision for furthering competition in the natural gas industry 
under this vision  regulated natural gas utilities or local distribution companies ldcs would plan to exit the business of purchasing gas for and selling gas to customers the merchant function over the next three to seven years 
ldcs would remain the operators of the gas system the distribution function and the provider of last resort of natural gas supplies during that period and until alternatives are developed 
the nypsc s goal is to encourage more competition at the local level by separating the merchant function from the distribution function 
as required by nypsc s policy statement  the company s two gas distribution subsidiaries filed a joint restructuring proposal with the nypsc in october the filing offers a comprehensive restructuring plan designed to i provide a significant impetus toward exiting the gas supply business and ii present the nypsc with an opportunity to realize its vision of a competitive unbundled gas supply market for all customers within the transitional time frame of three to seven years 
under the proposal the company s gas distribution subsidiaries would continue to be the provider of last resort during the transition period 
the restructuring plan seeks to jump start the migration of the mass customer market especially the residential and the small commercial and industrial markets from bundled utility sales service to unbundled transportation service  accelerates the elimination of regulatory cost burdens from the gas supply market  provides protections for low income customers  and sets forth a plan to minimize potential strandable costs 
currently  the company s gas distribution subsidiaries have contracts for the purchase of upstream interstate transportation  storage and supply with annual fixed demand charges of approximately million 
these contracts have terms that range from one to fourteen years and the associated demand charges through the term of the contracts are approximately billion 
the company has estimated its strandable costs as the costs under these contracts in excess of market value 
the company has assumed that  if it were necessary to assign the contracts to third parties  the company could recover the market value of the underlying assets 
therefore  the difference between the contract costs and the market value is the potential strandable costs 
the company estimates that  if the gas distribution subsidiaries continue to recover demand charges for the next five years  then the estimated potential strandable costs for contracts that will not expire by and would not be needed to provide service to firm transportation customers will be  on a present value basis  approximately million 
in its proposal  the company has set forth a plan to recover potential strandable costs during the transition period 
the plan includes the creation of a price differential between gas utility bundled service and unbundled services available in the marketplace 
the increased revenue generated from this price differential would be retained by the company s gas distribution subsidiaries for future application to recover costs associated with the transition to competition  including strandable costs 
in addition  the company recommends retention of certain customer refunds that otherwise would have been refunded to customers during the transition period 
the plan also recommends certain financial incentives and mechanisms to mitigate potential strandable costs 
the company believes that implementation of this plan  or some variation designed to achieve the same objectives  will allow both of its gas distribution subsidiaries to fully recover their strandable costs 
the company believes that its proposal strikes a balance among competing stakeholder interests in order to most effectively make available the benefits of the unbundled gas supply market to all customers 
the company currently is not able to determine the outcome of this proceeding and what effect  if any  it may have on its operations 
the electric industry as previously mentioned  the company s electric operations on long island are generally governed by its service agreements with lipa 
the agreements have terms of eight to fifteen years and generally provide for recovery of virtually all costs of production  operation and maintenance 
also  since long island is considered a load pocket  ie  there are insufficient transmission ties to permit a significant amount of energy to be transported into long island  the company faces minimal competitive pressures associated with its electric operations on long island at this time 
with its investment in the ravenswood facility  the company also has electric operations in new york city 
the company currently sells the energy produced by the ravenswood facility through daily and or hourly bidding into the nyiso energy markets 
further  the company has a capacity contract with con edison  which provides con edison with of the available capacity of the ravenswood facility 
the company anticipates that this contract will expire on april   at which time the available capacity of the ravenswood facility will be bid into on the auction process conducted by the nyiso 
new york city local reliability rules currently require that of the electric capacity needs of new york city is to be provided by in city generators 
at this time  there is a current shortage of in city capacity and the company  therefore  anticipates that it can sell the capacity of the ravenswood facility at a level approaching the ferc mandated price cap 
the company expects that the current local reliability rules will remain in effect at least through however  should new  more efficient electric power plants be built in new york city and or the requirement that of in city load be served by in city generators be modified  capacity and energy sales volumes could be adversely affected 
the company can not predict  however  when or if new power plants will be built or the nature of future new york city requirements 
derivative financial instruments as previously mentioned  and more fully detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values  the company hedges a portion of its exposure to commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
all of the company s derivative financial instruments  except for certain interest rate swaps  are and will continue to be classified as cash flow hedges 
as a result  implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities when adopted  is not expected to have a material effect on the company s net income  but could have a significant effect on comprehensive income because of fluctuations in the market value of the derivatives employed for hedging certain risks 
under sfas no 
 periodic changes in market value are recorded as comprehensive income  subject to effectiveness  and then included in net income to match the underlying transactions 
commodity hedges and financial instruments the company s gas utility subsidiaries  marketing  and gas exploration and production subsidiaries employ  from time to time  derivative financial instruments  such as natural gas and oil futures  options and swaps  for the purpose of hedging exposure to commodity price risk 
whenever hedge positions are in effect  the company s subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to derivative contracts  as well as nonperformance by the counter parties of the transactions against which they are hedged 
the company believes that the credit risk related to the futures  options and swap instruments is no greater than that associated with the primary commodity contracts which they hedge  as the instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions  and that reduction of the exposure to price risk lowers the company s overall business risk 
interest rate hedges the company continually monitors the cost relationship between fixed and variable rate debt 
in line with its objective to minimize capital costs  the company periodically enters into hedging transactions through interest rate swaps that effectively convert the terms of the underlying debt obligations from fixed to variable and or variable to fixed 
in addition  the company also enters into hedges to fix the rate on commitments to issue debt securities prior to the actual financing 
swap agreements are only entered into with creditworthy counter parties 
foreign currency fluctuations the company follows the principles of sfas no 
 foreign currency translation for recording its investments in foreign affiliates 
due to the company s purchases of certain canadian interests and its continued activities in northern ireland  the company s investment in foreign affiliates has been growing 
at december   the company s net assets in these affiliates was approximately million and at december   the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment was million favorable
