overview we are a leading provider of e 
business reporting solutions that enable organizations to systematically extract  publish and disseminate information across distributed computing environments 
we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as e 
business application vendors  resellers and distributors 
e 
business application vendors generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our software products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived primarily from license fees for software products and  to a lesser extent  fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  training and consulting 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of actuate holding  bv bv  the parent company of our distributors based in france  germany and the united kingdom 
the acquisition was accounted under the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded million in goodwill and various intangible assets  which are being amortized over periods not exceeding four years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of bv and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
license fee revenues from sales of software products directly to end user customers are recognized as revenue after execution of a license agreement or receipt of a definitive purchase order and shipment of the product  provided no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivables is deemed probable 
our products do not require significant customization 
the majority of license fee revenues from direct sales to end user customers is from sales of specific individual products to such customers and is recognized upon shipment of the applicable product 
advance payments from end user customers  in arrangements in which the end user customer has the right to future unspecified products  are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated term of the period  typically one year  during which the end user is entitled to receive the products 
these license arrangements generally have a term of between one and five years  which can be extended upon mutual agreement by the parties  are terminable by either party in the event of a material breach of the license agreement by the other party if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period  contain certain representations  warranties and indemnities and provisions designed to limit the parties liability under the license agreement 
furthermore  license arrangements with e 
business application vendors typically require that such vendors only license our products to their customers for use with such vendor s application 
furthermore  license arrangements with international distributors give such international distributors the exclusive right to distribute our products to end user customers headquartered in specified territories 
license arrangements with indirect channel partners such as e 
business application vendors  resellers and distributors generally take the form of either i fixed price arrangements in which the contracting entity has the right to the unlimited usage  unspecified future products  and resale of the licensed software for a specified term and pursuant to which license fee revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the license agreement or ii arrangements pursuant to which a license fee is paid to us  which we recognize as revenue upon shipment of all the products covered under the arrangement  provided the fees are fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is deemed probable 
service revenues are primarily comprised of revenue from maintenance agreements  training and consulting fees 
revenue from maintenance agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis as service revenue over the term of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
service revenues from training and consulting services are recognized upon completion of the work to be performed 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop as modified by sop to date we have sold our products internationally primarily through our subsidiaries in europe and our distributor in japan 
during  and  we derived  and of our total revenues  respectively  from sales outside the united states 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in increasing revenues from international sales 
although we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside the united states and to enter additional international markets  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
in order to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international distributors and increase the productivity of existing international distributors 
to the extent that we are unable to do so in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we are a party to an agreement with our japanese affiliate 
this agreement provides us a right to buy all the shares owned by other shareholders at a price indicated in the agreement 
this price increases every year by an amount indicated in the agreement 
the agreement also provides the other shareholders right to sell us all their shares at a price indicated in the agreement 
this price increases every year by an amount indicated in the agreement 
in connection with such acquisition  we would be required to pay a purchase price in registered shares of our common stock or in cash  which may have the effect of diluting existing stockholders  adversely affecting the price of our common stock or reducing the available cash for working capital and other purposes 
this potential acquisition could cause us to recognize substantial goodwill and other intangible assets  and record amortization charges in the quarters and fiscal years immediately following the date on which such an acquisition is effected  depending upon the purchase price paid by us for such acquisition 
as a result  this potential acquisition could have a material adverse effect on reported earnings per share during the periods in which we record the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
finally  this potential acquisition would require substantial management attention  impose costs on us associated with integrating the acquired entity  require us to coordinate sales and marketing efforts with the affiliate and subject us to additional  and potentially substantial  regulation as an owner of foreign subsidiaries  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult and unreliable 
in addition  given our limited operating history and recent rapid growth  historical growth rates in our revenues should not be considered indicative of future revenue growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license fees services total revenues cost of revenues license fees services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss revenues our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  training and consulting 
total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal the acquisition of bv in june generated approximately million in incremental revenues for fiscal no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues for any of the periods presented 
license fees 
revenues from license fees increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal the increases were due primarily to increased sales to new customers and increased follow on sales to existing customers and  to a lesser extent  increase in average selling prices for our products 
revenues from license fees from our indirect channel partners  including e 
business application vendors  resellers and distributors  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for  and  respectively 
services 
revenues from services increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal the increases were due primarily to increases in maintenance and support and  to a lesser extent  increases in training and consulting revenues related to increases in our installed customer base 
cost of revenues license fees 
cost of revenues from license fees consists primarily of product packaging  documentation and production costs  and related personnel and overhead allocations 
cost of revenues from license fees increased from  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal to million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal and decreased to  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in the number of licenses sold 
the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to increase in existing customers purchasing additional licenses in which no shipments were required since existing customers may make copies of their existing software up to the amount of software licensed 
the decrease in cost of license fees revenues as a percentage of license fees revenues were due to improved leverage in production and personnel costs and increase in the average selling price of our software 
we expect cost of revenues from license fees to continue to grow in absolute dollars due to increasing licensing activity and in the event that we acquire and resell other companies products or technologies 
services 
cost of services revenues consists primarily of personnel and related costs  facilities costs incurred in providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
cost of services revenues increased from million  or of services revenues  in fiscal to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal and to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increases in customer support personnel and increased third party costs to support the growing needs of our customers 
in fiscal cost of services revenues includes approximately million relating to cost of services incurred by our european subsidiaries since their acquisition in june the increase in cost of services as a percentage of services revenues in fiscal was due to costs of expanding our support and maintenance organization to meet the growing customer base and the decrease in fiscal was due to efficiency and economies of scale 
we expect cost of services to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we continue to hire additional customer support personnel 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  promotional expenses  travel and facility expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by from million in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  higher sales commissions associated with increased revenues and increased marketing activities 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses include approximately million of sales and marketing expenses incurred by our european subsidiaries since their acquisition in june the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due to revenues increasing at a faster rate than sales and marketing expenses 
we expect that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel  establish additional sales offices  expand international distribution channels and increase promotional activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expenses increased by from million in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increased personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing  depreciation of capital expenditures and facilities costs 
the decreases in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were due to revenues increasing at a faster rate than research and development expenses 
we believe that a significant level of investment in product development is essential to maintain product leadership and anticipates research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods for developing new products and providing enhancements to current products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for finance  human resources  information systems and general management  as well as legal and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by from million in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increases in personnel and related costs and professional fees necessary to manage and support our growth and facilities expansion 
the decreases as a percentage of total revenues were due to revenues increasing at a faster rate than general and administrative expenses 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional personnel to support expanded operations 
deferred compensation 
we recorded deferred compensation of nil in  approximately  in and  in in fiscal  and  we recorded amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively 
these amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants 
all such deferred compensation expense has been included in general and administrative expenses 
at december   we have approximately  remaining to be amortized over the corresponding vesting period of each respective option  generally five years 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
in connection with the acquisition of bv in june  we incurred direct merger related expenses of approximately  comprised primarily of professional fees 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting  which resulted in the recognition of million in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods not exceeding four years 
in fiscal  we recorded amortization expense of approximately million 
approximately million remains to be amortized 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  is comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income  net  increased from a net income of  in fiscal to  in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the increases were primarily the result of interest income earned on investment of million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in july provision for income taxes prior to  we incurred losses and we had not recorded any provision for income taxes 
for  the provision for income taxes was  consisting of federal and state taxes 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was  reflecting the utilization of operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million at december  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through approximately million in net proceeds from the private sales of preferred stock and cash from operations 
in july  we completed our initial public offering whereby we sold  shares of our common stock  adjusted for stock split 
the net proceeds to us  after deducting expenses relating to the offering  were million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million in highly liquid  high quality debt securities and a certificate of deposit classified as available for sale 
in fiscal  we generated positive cash flow of million from operating activities  and used  in fiscal and million in fiscal in operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in fiscal  net cash was used primarily in the acquisition of bv and purchase of short term investments 
in fiscal  net cash was used primarily for purchase of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal cash from financing activities in fiscal primarily reflect net proceeds from sales of common stock issued upon exercise of options under stock option and stock purchase plans 
cash from financing activities in fiscal primarily reflect net proceeds from sales of common stock issued during the initial public offering 
cash from financing activities in fiscal primarily reflect net proceeds from private sales of preferred stock 
we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity or obtain credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of our japanese distributor  or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  will be effective from our fiscal year this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial statements as we currently do not utilize derivative instruments 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  referred to as sab sab summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
we are currently in the process of evaluating sab and what effect it may have on our financial statements 
accordingly  we have not determined whether sab will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
year readiness computer systems and software must accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many software and computer systems that accepted only two digit entries needed to be upgraded in order to accept dates beginning january  to date  we have not experienced any date related problems with our software 
in addition  we have not been made aware of  nor have we experienced  date related problems with any third party software 
also  we do not believe that we will incur material costs in the future because of date related problems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  and  we derived  and of our total revenues  respectively  from sales outside the united states 
the majority of international revenues are denominated in us dollars 
our exposure to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies is limited 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country and may result in a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in was not material the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
