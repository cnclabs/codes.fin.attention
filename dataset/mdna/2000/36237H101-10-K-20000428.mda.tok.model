the company works closely with its licensors in creating designs and styles for each licensed brand sold by the company 
licensors generally must approve products to be sold under their brand names prior to production by the company 
the company works with retail chains in developing product lines sold under private retail labels 
with regard to private label sales  the company meets frequently with buyers who custom order products by color  fabric and style 
these buyers may provide samples to the company or may select styles already available in the company s showrooms 
the company has established a reputation among such buyers for the ability to arrange for manufacture of apparel on a reliable  expeditious and cost effective basis 
the company s in house designers are responsible for the design and look of the company s products 
the company responds to style changes in the apparel industry by maintaining a continuous program of style  color and type of leather and fabric selection 
in designing new products and styles  the company attempts to incorporate current trends and consumer preferences in the company s traditional product offerings 
the company seeks to design products in response to trends in consumer preferences  rather than to attempt to establish market trends and styles 
design personnel meet regularly with the company s sales and merchandising departments  as well as with the design and merchandising staffs of the company s licensors  to review market trends  sales results and the popularity of the company s latest products 
in addition  representatives of the company regularly attend trade and fashion shows and shop at fashion forward stores in the united states  europe and the far east  and present sample items to the company along with their evaluation of the styles expected to be in demand in the united states 
the company also seeks input from selected customers with respect to product design 
the company believes that its sensitivity to the needs of its retail customers  coupled with the flexibility of its production capabilities and its continual monitoring of the retail market  enables the company to modify designs and order specifications in a timely fashion 
the company s arrangements with selected overseas factories for textile apparel enables it to conduct test marketing in cooperation with specialty retailers and department stores prior to full manufacturing and marketplace introduction of certain styles and products 
test marketing typically involves introducing a new style into approximately to store locations in certain major markets 
if the company finds acceptance of the product on a consumer level  the company proceeds with full scale manufacturing and market introduction 
leather apparel manufacturing the company s products are imported from independent manufacturers located primarily in indonesia and china  and to a lesser extent  in south korea  india  the philippines and hong kong 
additionally  the company manufactures certain products at its wholly owned factory in indonesia and its partially owned factory in northern china 
a selected number of garments are also manufactured for the company by independent contractors located in the new york city area 
the company has a branch office in seoul  south korea  which acts as a liaison between the company and various manufacturers located throughout indonesia  china and south korea  used to produce the company s leather and woven garments 
upon receipt from the company s headquarters of production orders stating the quantity  quality and types of garments to be produced  this liaison office negotiates and places orders with one or more indonesian  chinese  or south korean manufacturers 
in allocating production among independent suppliers  the company considers a number of criteria  including quality  availability of production capacity  pricing and ability to meet changing production requirements 
at january   the south korean office employed persons 
in connection with the foreign manufacture of the company s leather apparel  manufacturers purchase skins and necessary submaterials such as linings  zippers  buttons and trimmings according to parameters specified by the company 
prior to commencing the manufacture of garments  samples of the skins and submaterials are sent to the south korean liaison office and the company s new york offices for approval 
employees of the liaison office regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of the products for the company in order to ensure timely delivery  maintain quality control  monitor compliance with company manufacturing specifications and inspect finished apparel 
because of the nature of leather skins  the manufacture of leather apparel is performed manually 
a pattern is used in cutting hides to panels which are assembled in the factory 
all submaterials are also added at this time 
products are inspected throughout this process to insure that design and quality specifications of the order  as provided by the company  are being maintained as the garment is assembled 
after pressing  cleaning and final inspection  the garment is labeled and hung awaiting shipment 
a final random inspection occurs when the garments are packed for shipment 
the company arranges for the production of apparel on a purchase order basis  with each order to a foreign manufacturer generally backed by an irrevocable international letter of credit 
substantially all letters of credit arranged by the company require as a condition of release of funds to the manufacturer  among others  that an inspection certificate be signed by a representative of the company 
accordingly  if an order is not filled  the letter of credit is not paid and the company does not bear the risk of liability for the goods being manufactured 
the company assumes the risk of loss on an fob basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and is insured against casualty losses arising during shipping 
as is customary in the leather industry  the company has not entered into any long term contractual arrangement with any contractor or manufacturer 
the company believes that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which it has developed or is developing a relationship is adequate to meet the company s leather apparel production requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that alternative foreign leather apparel manufacturers are readily available 
the company s arrangements with foreign manufacturers of its apparel are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad  including currency fluctuations  political instability and potential import restrictions  duties and tariffs 
in and  both indonesia and south korea experienced significant currency fluctuation and devaluation 
in addition  indonesia experienced significant inflation 
in  the economic situation in these countries appeared to have stabilized  although political instability still exists in indonesia 
although the company has not been materially adversely affected by any of these factors to date  due to the significant portion of the company s garments that are produced abroad  political instability in indonesia or elsewhere  or any substantial disruption in the business of foreign manufacturers or the company s relationships with these manufacturers could materially adversely affect the company s operations 
in addition  since the company negotiates its purchase orders with its foreign manufacturers in united states dollars  if the value of the united states dollar against local currencies were to go down  these manufacturers might increase the united states dollar prices charged to the company for products 
virtually all the company s imported leather products and raw materials are subject to united states customs duties of approximately 
a majority of all finished goods manufactured abroad are shipped to the company s new jersey warehouse and distribution facility for final inspection and allocation and reshipment to customers 
the goods are delivered to the company and its customers by independent shippers  choosing the form of shipment principally ship  truck or air based upon a customer s needs  cost  and time considerations 
marketing and distribution the company s products are sold primarily to department  specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the united states 
the company sells to approximately  customers  ranging from national and regional chains of specialty retail and department stores  whose annual purchases from the company exceed  to small specialty stores whose annual purchases from the company are less than  sales to the sam s club and wal mart divisions of wal mart stores  inc accounted for an aggregate of of the company s net sales in the fiscal year ended january   in the fiscal year ended january   and in the fiscal year ended january  the loss of this customer  which primarily purchases non licensed apparel  could have a material adverse affect on the company s non licensed business segment  as well as on the company s results of operations as a whole 
almost all of the company s sales are made in the united states 
the company also markets its products in canada and europe 
along with the company s foreign offices  the company s trading company subsidiary  global international trading company  located in seoul  korea  assists in providing services to the company s customers 
as of january   global international trading company employed persons 
the company s products are sold primarily through a direct employee sales force which consisted of employees as of january  the company s principal executives are also actively involved in sales of its products 
a limited amount of the company s products are also sold by various retail buying offices located throughout the united states 
final authorization of all sales of products is solely through the company s new york showroom  enabling the company s management to deal directly with  and be readily accessible to  major customers  as well as to more effectively control the company s selling operations 
the company primarily relies on its reputation and relationships to generate business 
the company believes it has developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry  as a result of  among other things  standards of quality control  on time delivery  competitive pricing and willingness and ability to assist customers in their merchandising of the company s products 
in addition  the company has  to a limited extent  advertised its products and engaged in cooperative ad programs with retailers 
the company believes it has developed brand awareness of company owned labels  despite the absence of general advertising  primarily through its reputation  consumer acceptance and the fashion press 
brand name products sold by the company pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by institutional and product advertisements placed by the licensor 
the company s license agreements generally provide that the company is required to pay the licensor a fee  based on a percentage of net sales of licensed product  to pay for a portion of these advertising costs 
the company operates one retail outlet store at its secaucus  new jersey warehouse 
the company s other retail outlet store in new jersey was closed in march raw materials most products manufactured for the company are purchased by the company on a finished goods basis 
raw materials used in the production of the company s leather apparel are available from numerous sources and are in adequate supply 
the company is not aware of any manufacturer of the company s apparel not being able to satisfy its requirements for any such raw materials due to an inadequacy of supply 
the leather apparel industry competes with manufacturers of other leather products for the supply of leather 
leather skins are a byproduct 
accordingly  raw material costs are impacted by changes in meat consumption worldwide as well as by the popularity of leather products 
textile apparel the company also produces outerwear from a variety of textiles such as wools  cottons and synthetic blends  suitable for leisure and active wear 
the company designs  imports and markets a moderately priced line of women s textile outerwear and sportswear under its colebrook co 
label and under private labels 
women s licensed textile outerwear is also produced under the kenneth cole and nine west labels and will be produced under the cole haan label for fall the men s textile apparel line consists of moderately priced outerwear and better priced sportswear under the caterpillar label 
the company will also produce men s textile outerwear under the jones new york and cole haan labels 
the company s development and design process as well as its marketing and distribution strategies for textile apparel are similar to those employed for its leather apparel 
see products development and design and leather apparel marketing and distribution of this item above 
textile outerwear is manufactured for the company by several independent contractors located primarily in the far east and  to a lesser extent  domestically 
manufacturers produce finished garments in accordance with production samples approved by the company and obtain necessary quota allocations and other requisite customs clearances 
to facilitate better service for the company s textile and leather apparel customers and accommodate and control the volume of manufacturing in the far east  the company has an office in hong kong 
similar to the seoul office  the hong kong office acts as a liaison between the company and the various manufacturers of textile and leather apparel located in hong kong and china 
the company utilizes its domestic and hong kong office employees to monitor production at each manufacturer s facility to ensure quality control  compliance with the company s specifications and timely delivery of finished garments to the company s distribution facilities or customers 
the hong kong office employed persons as of january  the company s arrangements with its textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to the risks attendant to doing business abroad  including the availability of quota and other requisite customs clearances for textile apparel  the imposition of export duties  political and social instability and currency fluctuations 
united states customs duties on the company s textile apparel presently range from to  depending upon the type of fabric used and how the garment is constructed 
the company monitors duty  tariff and quota related developments and seeks to minimize its potential exposure to quota related risks through  among other measures  geographical diversification of its manufacturing sources and shifts of production among countries and manufacturers 
licensing the sale of licensed products is a key element of the company s strategy and the company has significantly expanded its offerings of licensed products over the last several years 
the company has license agreements to produce products under the kenneth cole  nine west  cole haan and jones new york fashion labels and a distribution agreement for caterpillar apparel 
the company is also licensed to produce products containing trademarks of the major league baseball  national football league  national hockey league  national basketball association  and several universities located in the united states 
the company continues to seek other opportunities to enter into license agreements in order to expand its product offerings under nationally recognized labels 
revenues from the sale of licensed products accounted for of net sales during fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal seasonality retail sales of outerwear apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature 
although the company sells its apparel products throughout the year  net sales in the months of july through november accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended january  and of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended january  the july through november time frame is expected to continue to provide a disproportionate amount of the company s net sales 
backlog a significant portion of the company s orders are short term purchase orders from customers who place orders on an as needed basis 
the amount of unfilled orders at any time has not been indicative of future sales 
information relative to open purchase orders at any date may also be materially affected by  among other things  the timing of the initial showing of apparel to the trade  as well as by the timing of recording of orders and shipments 
as a result  the company does not believe that the amount of its unfilled customer orders at any time is meaningful 
trademarks several trademarks owned by the company have been granted federal trademark protection through registration with the us patent and trademark office  including for g iii  avalanche  jl colebrook  laura renee  cayenne  g iii outerwear company store  jlc design  jlc outerwear design  jlc design  trouble wanted design  sports football player design  and ladies first by g iii carl banks 
the company has applications for several additional registrations pending before the us patent and trademark office 
the company has been granted trademark registration for g iii in france  canada  mexico  and european union  for jl colebrook in germany  canada  mexico  france  great britain  benelux and european union and for jlc design and jlc design in canada 
the company also has several additional applications pending in the european community and canada 
although the company regards its trademarks as valuable assets and intends to vigorously enforce its trademark rights  the company does not believe that any failure to obtain federal trademark registrations for which it has applied would have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition and other risks the apparel business is highly competitive 
the company has numerous competitors with respect to the sale of leather and textile apparel  including distributors that import leather apparel from abroad and domestic retailers with established foreign manufacturing capabilities 
sales of the company s products are affected by style  price  quality and general fashion trends 
the company may also be deemed to compete with vertically integrated apparel manufacturers that also own retail stores 
in addition  the company competes for supplies of raw materials and manufacturing and tanning capacity 
the company s ability to successfully compete depends on a number of factors  including the company s ability to effectively anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes  to translate market trends into attractive product offerings and operate within substantial production and delivery constraints 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this regard 
if the company misjudges the market for its products  it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities with others 
in addition  weak sales and resulting markdown requests from customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the apparel industry is cyclical 
purchases of outerwear and other apparel tend to decline during recessionary periods and sales of the company s products may decline at other times as well for a variety of reasons  including changes in fashion trends and the introduction of new products or pricing changes by the company s competitors 
uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could affect consumer spending habits and have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is dependent on morris goldfarb and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of mr 
goldfarb and any negative market or industry perception arising from the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s other executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in the company s business and have made significant contributions to its success 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect the company 
a majority of the company s products are imported from independent foreign manufacturers 
the failure of these manufacturers to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers 
the failure to make timely deliveries could cause customers to cancel orders  refuse to accept delivery of product or demand reduced prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is also dependent on these manufacturers for compliance with the policies of the company and its customers regarding labor practices 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of leather or other raw materials used by the company could have a material adverse effect on its cost of goods sold and ability to meet customer demands 
in addition  legislation that would restrict the importation of textiles and other apparel produced abroad has been periodically introduced in the us congress 
new legislation or executive initiatives could also result in a reevaluation of the trading status of certain countries  including china 
any change in the trading status of china or other countries in which the company s products are manufactured  or any retaliatory duties  quotas or trade sanctions  could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in these countries and materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in addition to the factors described above  the company s business  including its revenues and profitability  is influenced by and subject to a number of factors that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict including  among others risks associated with the company s dependence on its licensing agreements for a substantial portion of its revenues  including the risk that a license agreement will not be renewed when it expires  risks associated with consolidations  restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry  changes in regional  national and global economic conditions  and the company s ability to correctly balance the level of its finished goods  leather and other raw material commitments with actual orders

the non licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel under company owned brands and private label brands  as well as commission fee income received on sales when the company s customer provides the letter of credit 
the licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel brands licensed by the company from third parties 
see note l to the company s consolidated financial statements for financial information with respect to the company s segments 
the company s return to profitability during fiscal was primarily attributable to higher margins in both the company s licensed and non licensed business  offset to some extent by losses from the bet design studio joint venture 
one of the key elements of the company s strategy is to expand its offering of licensed apparel 
during fiscal  the company commenced the shipment of product under the caterpillar and major league baseball labels 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company entered into license agreements to produce apparel under the cole haan and jones new york labels 
in april  the company s license with tommy hilfiger ended 
the company expects to continue to produce and sell goods directly to tommy hilfiger 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company  together with black entertainment television bet  its joint venture partner  decided to discontinue their bet design studio joint venture 
the company had originally entered into the joint venture with bet in april to design  manufacture  and distribute sportswear and outerwear apparel targeted to the african american and urban consumer 
the initial product offerings by the joint venture were introduced in february and the company began shipping product in july the company owns of this joint venture and  accordingly  its entire results of operations are consolidated with those of the company 
the interest of bet in the joint venture is reflected in the minority interest line item in the company s financial statements 
net of bet s interest  the company incurred losses from this joint venture of approximately  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million inclusive of a  charge in fiscal year ended january  fiscal compared to year ended january  fiscal net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net sales increased as a result of increased sales of both licensed and non licensed apparel 
net sales of licensed apparel increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales of non licensed apparel increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales of licensed apparel continued to increase as a percentage of net sales  and accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal gross profit was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal commission fee income  for which there is no related cost of goods sold  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross profit for licensed apparel was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or of net sales of licensed apparel in fiscal compared to of net sales of licensed apparel in fiscal the higher gross profit margin percentage for licensed apparel in fiscal was due to increased sales of higher gross profit margin products 
gross profit for non licensed apparel was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  or of net sales of non licensed apparel in fiscal compared to of net sales of non licensed apparel in fiscal the increase in the gross profit margin percentage for non licensed apparel was primarily attributable to increased sales of higher gross profit products  and to improved gross margins on sales of prior season merchandise in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  including million of expenses with respect to the bet design studio joint venture 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal include a provision for  relating to the uncertainty of indonesian assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the local economy in indonesia had stabilized and the imminent threat of asset impairment relating to its facility was no longer present 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced because the company reversed this provision for the uncertainty of the indonesian assets 
excluding the bet design studio expenses and the effect of uncertainty of the indonesian provision and its reversal  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increased advertising expenses million and higher bonuses million  offset somewhat by lower rent expense  salaries  and professional fees 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the bet design studio expenses and the effect of indonesian provision and its reversal  were in fiscal compared to in fiscal on november   the company announced that bet design studio  llc  a joint venture with bet  would be dissolved 
the joint venture was dissolved because it was not profitable and the urban market was saturated with similar products
