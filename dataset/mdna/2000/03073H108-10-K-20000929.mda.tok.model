general ameritrans acquired elk in december   and to date we have had no activities other than the acquisition and operation of elk 
elk is an sbic that has been operating since  making loans to and  to a limited extent  investments in small businesses  primarily businesses that are majority owned by persons who qualify under sba regulations as socially or economically disadvantaged 
most of elk s business has consisted of originating and servicing loans collateralized by new york city  boston  chicago and miami taxi medallions  but elk also makes loans to and investments in other diversified businesses and to persons who qualify under sba regulations as non disadvantaged 
historically  elk s earnings derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets consisting of business loans  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities consisting of indebtedness to elk s banks and subordinated debentures issued to the sba 
net interest income is a function of the net interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to interest bearing liabilities 
unrealized depreciation on loans and investments is recorded when elk adjusts the value of a loan to reflect management s estimate of the fair value  as approved by the board of directors

balance sheet and reserves total assets increased by  as of june  when compared to total assets as of june  this increase was due to management s decision to expand its portfolio in the chicago taxi medallion market plus increases in the diversified loan portfolio 
this expansion was financed by additional bank debt   during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations through private placements of its securities  bank financing  and the issuance to the sba of its subordinated debentures 
in  elk agreed to repurchase all of the  outstanding shares of its preferred stock from the sba for an aggregate price of  representing a discount of from the original issue price of per share 
as a condition of the repurchase  elk granted the sba a liquidating interest in a newly established restricted capital surplus account the restricted capital account 
the restricted capital account is equal to the amount of the net repurchase discount in which the sba received a liquidating interest  amortized over months ending november  however  if elk is liquidated or if a material violation of sba regulations occurs during the amortization period  the sba would receive the remaining unamortized amount of the restricted capital account prior to the stockholders of elk receiving any amounts on their common stock 
the unamortized balance of the sba s liquidating interest at december  was nil 
in december and september elk raised additional capital of  and  respectively  less private placement costs of  and  respectively 
these proceeds were used to repurchase elk s preferred stock from the sba 
in connection with the purchase  all dividends in arrears on the preferred stock were extinguished 
during january  elk completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for aggregate gross proceeds of  less offering expenses of  the net proceeds were utilized to repay bank indebtedness and for working capital 
a portion of the proceeds temporarily used to reduce bank indebtedness  up to a maximum of  was allocated by elk toward the organization and capitalization of its new parent company  ameritrans 
at june   of elk s indebtedness was represented by indebtedness to its banks and by the debentures issued to the sba with fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
elk currently may borrow up to  under its existing lines of credit  subject to the limitations imposed by its borrowing base agreement with its banks and the sba  the statutory and regulatory limitations imposed by the sba  and the availability of funds 
in addition  elk is presently eligible to apply for additional leverage from the sba if it is determined by the board of directors to be in the best interests of the company 
no assurance can be given that  if applied for  such additional financing will be approved by the sba 
loan amortization and prepayments also provide a source of funding for elk 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
like elk  ameritrans will distribute at least of its investment company taxable income and  accordingly  we will continue to rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in order to provide the funds necessary for our expansion strategy  we expect to raise additional capital and to incur  from time to time  additional bank indebtedness and if deemed necessary by management to obtain sba loans 
there can be no assurances that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms
