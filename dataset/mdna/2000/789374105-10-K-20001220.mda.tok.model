item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a bank holding company engaged in the financial services business serving southeastern wisconsin through its wholly owned subsidiary  the bank 
in january  the company completed the acquisition of the stock of reliance bancshares  inc  which was subsequently merged into the bank 
the earnings of the company depend on its level of net interest income and other operating income offset by general and administrative expenses and the level of low income housing credits 
net interest income is a function of the company s net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of average ratio of interest earning assets as compared to interest bearing liabilities 
other operating income consists primarily of loan servicing fees  deposit charges  gains on sales of loans and securities  income from the operation of affordable housing properties and commissions on insurance  annuity and brokerage products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  expenses from operation of affordable housing properties  data processing and advertising expenses 
the company s affordable housing subsidiary generates tax credits which reduce the company s federal income tax expense 
the company s operations include four strategic business segments retail banking  commercial banking  mortgage banking and investments 
management evaluates the financial performance of each segment primarily based on the individual segments direct contribution to the company s net income 
information regarding the net interest income  other operating income  profit and average assets for the fiscal years ended september   and is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
the company s operating results are significantly affected by general economic conditions and the monetary  fiscal and regulatory policies of governmental agencies 
lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing  competition among lenders  the level of interest rates and the availability of funds 
deposit flows and costs of funds likewise are heavily influenced by prevailing market rates of interest on competing investment alternatives  account maturities and the levels of personal income and savings in the company s market areas 
financial condition total assets at september  were billion  an increase of million from billion at september  the primary area of growth was an increase of million in loans receivable offset by a decline of million in mortgage backed and related securities available for sale 
mortgage backed and related securities  including securities available for sale  decreased to million at september  from million at september   which represented and of total assets  respectively 
in fiscal  the company began reducing the size of its mortgage backed securities portfolios which management anticipates will continue to be an ongoing strategic initiative of the company in fiscal as part of this effort  the company has reduced the size of the mortgage backed securities and investment securities portfolios by million and used the funds generated from the repayment of principal on such portfolios to fund the growth in the company s loan portfolio 
net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  increased million to billion at september  from billion at september  in addition to the company s efforts to grow its loan portfolio  the company has continued to diversify its loan portfolio and as a result  the increase included increases in commercial real estate and commercial and agriculture 
the company s one to four family portfolio also increased in fiscal the generally higher interest rate environment during the current year impacted the amount and type of loans originated during fiscal compared with fiscal gross commercial real estate and multi family loans increased by million to million 
one to four family home mortgage loans increased million to million 
as interest rates rose during the current year  originations of one to four family mortgage loans shifted from fixed rate products to adjustable rate arm products  which the company retained in its loan portfolio 
it is anticipated that a majority of these loans may eventually convert to a fixed rate product and be sold into the secondary market 
commercial loans increased million to million  reflecting the company s continued commitment to this area also 
home equity lines of credit increased million to million 
consumer loans decreased million to million 
the decrease in consumer loans is due to a decline in originations  accelerated repayments of consumer loans and the discontinuance of the company s indirect auto loan program during the current year 
the company originated million of commercial real estate and multi family loans for the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september  commercial loan originations decreased to million loans for the year ended september  compared with million in the prior year 
one to four family and residential construction loan originations decreased to million for the year ended september  compared with million in the prior year 
the company originated million of home equity loans for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  consumer loan originations decreased to million loans for the year ended september  compared with million in the prior year 
the generally higher interest rate environment during the current year impacted the amount and type of loans originated during fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in originations was due to this change in interest rates and was not part of a strategic initiative of the company during fiscal real estate held for investment decreased to million at september   from million at september   consisting of affordable housing projects within the state of wisconsin  which qualify for tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
deposits decreased million to billion at september  from billion at september  the decrease in deposits was due primarily to decreases of million in passbook accounts and million in certificates of deposit offset by increases of million in money market demand account deposits and million in checking accounts 
at september   certificates of deposits included million in brokered certificates of deposit compared with million at september   a decrease of million 
the brokered deposits are generally used to fund the company s loan growth  with terms from three months to ten years in maturity 
the majority of the money market demand accounts are tied to a national money market fund index and compete with money market funds 
the level of deposit flows during any given period is heavily influenced by factors such as the general level of interest rates as well as alternative yields that investors may obtain on competing instruments  such as money market mutual funds 
advances and other borrowings increased to million at september  from million at september  the company uses wholesale funding sources  primarily advances from the fhlb  to fund that part of loan growth not funded by growth in retail deposits 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and general net income for the year ended september  decreased to million compared with million for the year ended september  in fiscal  the company made a voluntary acceleration of loan principal to the company s employee stock ownership plan esop 
net income was reduced million for the year ended september  by the additional esop compensation expense 
the remaining principal balance of the esop loan was repaid during the quarter ended june  and the additional esop expense ended with that quarter 
net income for the year ended september   excluding the additional esop expense  was higher than the previous year primarily due to a million increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses and a decrease of million in general and administrative expenses  partially offset by an increase of  in the provision for loan losses and a million decrease in other operating income 
net interest income net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was due to an increase of million in average earning assets  partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to in from in while the company has adopted interest rate risk policies in an effort to protect net interest income from significant increases or decreases in interest rates  the company s net income could still be affected by a narrowing of its net interest rate spread 
total interest income increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in interest income was primarily the result of increases of million in interest on loans  million in interest on mortgage backed and related securities and million in interest in debt and equity securities 
the increase in interest on loans was due to an increase in the average balance of loans to billion for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans which decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increase in interest on interest mortgage backed and related securities was due to an increase in the average balance to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   as well as an increase in the average yield on mortgage backed and related securities to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increase in interest on debt and equity securities was due to an increase in the average balance to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   as well as an increase in the average yield on debt and equity securities to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increase in the average yields is due primarily to the higher interest rate environment in effect during the year as compared to historical rates 
total interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  interest expense on deposits increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the average balance of deposits increased to billion for the year ended september   from billion for the year ended september  the increases in the balances of deposits are due to growth in retail deposit products 
the average cost of deposits increased to for the year ended september   from for the year ended september  brokered deposits decreased to million during the year compared to million in at weighted average stated rates of and  respectively 
the higher cost of the brokered certificates reflects the use of longer term callable brokered deposits 
the company then  in effect  lowers the cost of the deposits through the use of interest rate swaps to rates approximating short term rates 
this funding then matches the interest rate characteristics of the related asset  which is generally a short term adjusting mortgage backed security 
as part of a continuing strategy  the company continues to offer deposit products that compete more effectively with money market funds and other non financial deposit products 
such accounts have generally changed the company s traditional mix of deposit accounts to one that is more adjustable to current interest rates such as the money market demand account 
this has resulted in passbook and certificate of deposit accounts representing a lower percentage of the company s deposit portfolio other than brokered certificates 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased  or to million for the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september  for the year ended september   net charge offs were million compared with  for the year ended september  net charge offs for the year ended september  included a  charge off on a commercial real estate credit that had been in non performing status since and had been fully reserved for in prior periods 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at september  and  respectively  representing and of total gross loans  respectively 
the amount of non performing loans was million or of gross loans at september   compared to million or of gross loans at september  the provision for loan loss is established based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy 
other operating income other operating income decreased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in gains on sales of mortgage loans  a gain on the sale of real estate held for sale and income from the company s affordable housing subsidiary  partially offset by increases in loan servicing and deposit fee income 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans decreased to million for the year ended september  compared with million for the prior year 
the level of gains on loans is highly dependent on the interest rate environment and resulting level of origination of mortgage loans 
the recent increase in interest rates on mortgage loans has resulted in a lower level of loan originations and also in a higher proportion of adjustable rate mortgage loans which the company retains in its own portfolio 
the company generally realizes less gain on the sale of loans during periods of rising interest rates 
income from the operations of the company s affordable housing subsidiary which represents primarily rental income decreased to million from million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this was due to the sale of affordable housing properties on which the company realized gains of million for the year ended september  there was no such gain in the current fiscal year 
loan servicing and loan related fees increased to million from million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
deposit fees and service charges increased to million for the year ended september  compared with million in the prior year 
the company has been increasing its mix of deposit accounts that generate various fee incomes such as overdraft fees and atm surcharges 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  excluding the additional esop expense  decreased million or to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  the primary cause for the decrease in the current year was a decline in affordable housing expenses due to a sale of a portion of the company s affordable housing projects in the previous year and to a decline in compensation and employee benefits 
considering the actual effect of the additional esop expense of million for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased to million compared to million in the prior year 
however  the entire esop loan principal was repaid in fiscal and management anticipates the absence of the expense going forward will have a positive influence on earnings 
income tax expense income tax expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september  the company s effective tax rate is lower than the combined federal and state tax rates primarily due to the effect of the tax credits earned by the company s affordable housing subsidiary 
the increase in the effective tax rate in the current year is due primarily to the fact that the majority of the esop expense is non deductible for tax purposes and because of a decrease in the tax credits earned by the company s affordable housing subsidiary  as a result of the sale of of the properties in the prior year 
income tax credits decreased to million for the year ended september   compared to million in the prior year 
the company is currently carrying forward tax credits that it has not utilized on its tax returns 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and general net income for the year ended september  increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  factors causing the change in net income included a million increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses  a million decrease in other operating income offset by a decrease of 
million in the provision for loan losses  an increase of million in general and administrative expenses and an increase of million in income tax expenses 
net interest income net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was due to an increase of million in average earning assets  partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to in from in while the company has adopted interest rate risk policies in an effort to protect net interest income from significant increases or decreases in interest rates  the company s net income could still be affected by a narrowing of its net interest rate spread 
total interest income increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in interest income was primarily the result of increases of million in interest on loans  million in interest on mortgage backed and related securities and million in interest in debt and equity securities 
the increase in interest on loans was due to an increase in the average balance of loans to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans which decreased to for the year ended september   from for the year ended september  the increase in interest on interest mortgage backed and related securities was due to an increase in the average balance to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed and related securities which decreased to for the year ended september   from for the year ended september  the increase in interest on debt and equity securities was due to an increase in the average balance to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on debt and equity securities which decreased to for the year ended september   from for the year ended september  the increase in the average balance of loans includes the acquisition of million in net loans from reliance  but is due primarily to the company s efforts to increase its emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
the increase in the average balances of mortgage backed and related securities and debt and equity securities is due primarily to the company s efforts to fully leverage its capital 
the decrease in the average yields is due primarily to the lower interest rate environment in effect during the year as compared to historical rates 
as loans and securities repay and or mature  they are replaced in the company s portfolios by new loans and securities  which generally have lower interest rates than those previously put in the portfolio 
total interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  interest expense on deposits increased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the average balance of deposits increased to billion for the year ended september   from billion for the year ended september  the increases in the balances of deposits are due to growth in retail deposit products and an increase in brokered certificates of deposit 
the average cost of deposits decreased to for the year ended september   from for the year ended september  brokered deposits increased to million during the year compared to million in at weighted average stated rates of and  respectively 
the higher cost of the brokered certificates reflects the use of longer term callable brokered deposits to fund the company s leverage program 
the company then  in effect  lowers the cost of the deposits through the use of interest rate swaps to rates approximating short term rates 
this funding then matches the interest rate characteristics of the related asset  which is generally a short term adjusting mortgage backed security 
as part of a continuing strategy  the company continues to offer deposit products that compete more effectively with money market funds and other non financial deposit products

million or to million for the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september  net charge offs for the year ended september  were  compared with  for the year ended september  the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at september  and  respectively  representing and of total gross loans  respectively 
the amount of non performing loans was million or of gross loans at september   compared to million or of gross loans at september  the provision for loan loss is established based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy 
other operating income other operating income decreased million or to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in gains on sales of mortgage loans  gains on securities  income from the company s affordable housing subsidiary and other income  partially offset by a gain on the sale of real estate held for sale and increases in deposit fee income 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans decreased to million for the year ended september  compared with million for the prior year 
the level of gains on loans is highly dependent on the interest rate environment and resulting level of origination of mortgage loans 
the recent increase in interest rates on mortgage loans has resulted in a lower level of loan originations and also in a higher proportion of adjustable rate mortgage loans which the company retains in its own portfolio 
the company generally realizes less gain on the sale of loans than during periods of rising interest rates 
losses on investments and mortgage backed and related securities were  for the year ended september   compared to gains of million for the year ended september  the company does not consider gains on the sale of securities as a predictable source of earnings  as such sales are based on the company s ongoing review of the individual securities within the company s available for sale portfolio whereby securities may be sold and replaced with ones that offer a different combination of interest income  interest rate risk or credit risk than the security sold 
income from the operations of the company s affordable housing subsidiary which represents primarily rental income decreased to million from million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this was due to sale of affordable housing properties on which the company realized gains of million for the year ended september  deposit fees and service charges increased to million for the year ended september  compared with million in the prior year 
the company has been increasing its mix of deposit accounts that generate various fee incomes such as overdraft fees and atm surcharges 
other operating income for the year ended september  includes  related to a refund of state income taxes related to a prior year s tax audit 
the interest portion of the refund is included in other operating income while the portion that is a refund of previous taxes paid reduces income tax expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits and office building and equipment expenses  partially offset by a decrease in affordable housing expenses 
the compensation  office building and equipment expenses increased due to the company s increasing level of banking assets  the addition of physical branch locations and expansion of newer lines of business 
in particular  the company has expanded its commercial lending capabilities and put in place an investment products division 
included in these cost areas are the costs of the year issue 
the decrease in the affordable housing expenses is due to the sale of affordable housing properties 
included in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  is  relating to a settlement of a lawsuit involving a contractor that went out of business before completing home improvement work on properties on which the bank was the lender 
income tax expense income tax expense increased by million to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september  the company s effective tax rate is significantly lower than the combined federal and state tax rates due to the effect of the tax credits earned by the company s affordable housing subsidiary 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due to the aforementioned refund of state income taxes of  included in the prior year  and the decrease in tax credits earned by the company s affordable housing subsidiary due to the sale of properties in the current year 
income tax credits decreased to million for the year ended september   compared to million in the prior year 
the company is currently carrying forward tax credits that it has not utilized on its tax returns 
the decision to dispose of several properties will allow the company to utilize the tax credits sooner on its consolidated federal tax return 
average balance sheet the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated average statements of financial condition and the consolidated statements of income for the years ended september   and  and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived principally from average daily balances and include non accruing loans 
the yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields 
the amount of interest income resulting from the recognition of loan fees was   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
interest income on non accruing loans is reflected in the year that it is collected 
such amounts are not material to net interest income or net change in net interest income in any year 
non accrual loans are included in the average balances and do not have a material effect on the average yield 
tax exempt investments are immaterial and the tax equivalent method of presentation is not included in the schedule 
interest rate swaps  which are accounted for as a hedge of the cost of various liabilities  are included in the category of the liability being hedged

net interest income depends upon the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  iii changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate changes in the rate multiplied by the changes in the volume and iv the net change

the company maintains a high level of short term savings deposits  including passbook savings  now checking accounts and money market deposit accounts 
these accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the company s investments in mortgage backed and related securities and mortgage loans because of the shorter maturity and repricing characteristics of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect earnings 
in an attempt to manage vulnerability to interest rate changes  management monitors the company s interest rate risks 
the company has established its investment strategies through an asset liability committee  which reports to the board of directors 
the committee generally meets monthly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position  maturing securities and borrowings  interest rates and programs for raising deposits  including retail and brokered and nonbrokered wholesale deposits  and originating and purchasing of loans  and develops policies dealing with these issues 
the company seeks primarily to manage its interest rate risk through structuring its balance sheet by investing in a variety of different types of financial instruments in order to reduce its vulnerability to changes in interest rates and to enhance its income 
the company s assets and liabilities maturing and repricing within one year generally result in a negative one year gap  which occurs when the level of liabilities maturing or repricing within one year are greater than the level of assets maturing or repricing within the same period of time 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  and for a prolonged period  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
the company attempts to maintain a negative one year gap of less than of total assets 
if in the estimation of management  the one year gap exceeded or was soon to exceed that limit  actions would be taken to reduce the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
generally  the company uses the following strategies to reduce its interest rate risk i the company seeks to originate and hold a variety of arms or other mortgage loans with short to medium term average lives or terms and invests in primarily adjustable rate mortgage backed and related securities with short to medium term average lives  ii the company seeks to lengthen the maturities of deposits when deemed cost effective through the pricing and promotion of certificates of deposit with terms of one to five years  and periodically utilizes deposit marketing programs offering maturity and repricing terms structured to complement the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing asset liability mix  iii the company has utilized longer term borrowings  principally secured from the fhlb  in order to manage its assets and liabilities and enhance earnings  and iv the company is utilizing its capital position to increase earning assets by investing primarily in agency or private issue remic securities with short and medium terms of two to five years and financing the purchases with fhlb advances or brokered deposits that generally match the expected average lives of the respective securities 
the company continues to monitor its interest rate risk as that risk relates to its strategies 
at september   total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded total interest earning assets maturing or repricing in the same period by million  representing a negative cumulative one year gap ratio of  compared to a negative cumulative one year gap ratio of at september  the negative gap position is due primarily to the short term effect of the amount of fixed rate puttable fhlb advances coming due within the next year which the company plans to extend as they come due 
subsequent to september   the company took several steps to lower its negative one year gap to under and will continue to do so in the future 
the primary step taken was to lengthen the maturity structure of several of its funding sources including fhlb advances and brokered certificates of deposit 
the company also tried to adjust the maturity structure of arm loans by originating year arm loans versus year arm loans when possible 
with a negative gap position  during periods of rising interest rates it is expected that the cost of the company s interest bearing liabilities will rise more quickly than the yield on its interest earning assets  which will have a negative effect upon its net interest income 
although the opposite effect on net interest income would occur in periods of falling interest rates  the company could experience substantial prepayments of its fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed and related securities in periods of falling interest rates  which results in the reinvestment of such proceeds at market rates which are lower than current rates 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at september  more than more than within four to one year three three twelve to three years to over five months months years five years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans residential       commercial       consumer       mortgage backed and related securities      assets available for sale mortgage loans   fixed rate mortgage related       variable rate mortgage related   investment securities      trading account securities other assets   impact of interest rate swaps   total       interest bearing liabilities deposits now accounts       passbook savings accounts       money market deposit accounts

for fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed and related securities  annual prepayment rates ranging from to  based on the loan coupon rate  were used 
balances have been reduced for undisbursed loan proceeds  unearned insurance premiums  deferred loan fees  purchased loan discounts and allowances for loan losses  which aggregated million at september  although the company s now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts generally are subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a certain portion of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based on the company s retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts are assumed to be withdrawn at annual rates of  and  respectively  of the declining balance of such accounts during the period shown 
the withdrawal rates used are higher than the company s historical rates but are considered by management to be more indicative of expected withdrawal rates in a rising interest rate environment 
if all the company s now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts had been assumed to be repricing within one year  the one year cumulative deficiency of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities would have been million or of total assets 
brokered deposits with a call option are included in the period in which they are due rather than in the period of their modified duration since they are currently out of the money 
fixed rate puttable fhlb advances are included in the period of their modified duration rather than in the period in which they are due 
borrowings include fixed rate puttable fhlb advances of million maturing within three months  million maturing in four to twelve months  million maturing in one to three years and million maturing in three to five years 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities in the company s portfolios could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to the exercise of conversion options and refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
in order to measure earnings sensitivity the corporation utilizes a dynamic gap analysis 
the dynamic gap analysis involves analyzing the impact on contractual repricing and maturity characteristics for rate sensitive assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments adjusted for the anticipated impact on repricing  prepayment  and option features for different interest rate scenarios various parallel yield curve shifts 
a dynamic consolidated gap position is then analyzed for the impact on net interest income in the various environments 
the corporation s consolidated one year negative gap is as of september  the projected sensitivity on net interest income for an immediate and parallel upward yield curve shift of and basis points is and respectively 
the corporation further measures interest rate risk by analyzing the impact of changing interest rates on the corporation s market value portfolio equity market value adjusted capital 
the market value portfolio equity analysis involves analyzing the market value of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities under different interest rate and prepayment environments 
the change in the market value portfolio equity for changes in interest rates is measured against its current base case

the company enters into interest rate exchange agreements swaps from time to time in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with certain liabilities 
the agreements have been both fixed pay  floating receive swaps whereby the company pays interest at a fixed rate and receives interest at a floating rate based on a notional amount of principal  locking in a fixed cost of funds and fixed receive  floating pay swaps whereby the company receives interest at a fixed rate and pays interest at a floating rate based on a notional amount of principal  locking in a floating cost of funds 
the net interest income or expense resulting from the differential between exchanging floating rate and fixed rate interest payments is recorded on a current basis 
there are certain risks associated with swaps  including the risk that the counterparty may default and that there may not be an exact correlation between the indices on which the swap agreements are based and the terms of the hedged liabilities 
in order to offset these risks  the company generally enters into swap agreements only with nationally recognized securities firms and monitors the credit status of counterparties  the level of collateral for such swaps and the correlation between the hedged liabilities and indices utilized 
generally  the swaps have been designed to more accurately match the interest cash flows of certain liabilities used to fund specific assets to the interest rate characteristics of those assets 
at september  and  the company had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
million is the largest aggregate notional amount of the company s interest rate swaps at any one time over the past five years 
at september   the company had a million in fixed pay floating receive agreement with a maturity date of the agreement has a fixed interest rate of and a variable interest rate of 
at september   the company had million in fixed receive floating pay agreements with maturity dates ranging from to and call dates ranging from to the agreements have fixed interest rates ranging from to and variable interest rates ranging from to 
for the years ended september   and  the company realized net interest income on interest rate exchange agreement activity of million  million and million  respectively 
while this activity resulted in net interest income in fiscal years  and  the company effectively matched the related funding costs of certain assets with the interest rate characteristics of those assets 
the company s investment policy limits the notional amount of outstanding interest rate exchange agreements to million 
any notional amounts of interest rate exchange agreements in excess of million must be approved by the company s board of directors 
the company also utilizes financial futures or options to manage anticipated increases in interest rates and the resulting decline in the market prices of its mortgage loan production 
the options provide a practical floor and cap on portfolio market values for moderate interest rate movements while the forward contracts are used to offset actual and anticipated on and off balance sheet positions of the company 
these options result in a certain amount of potential interest rate and market value risk exposure for the company 
the amount of the actual exposure is determined by the exercise of these options 
the company generally sells options for settlement no more than four months forward 
an option s likelihood of exercise is dependent upon the relation of the market price of the underlying security to the strike price of the option 
the strategy is not meant to offset losses that could be incurred during a substantial interest rate move and actually may result in additional losses on the instruments themselves which is beyond the losses the company would have incurred had the management techniques not been utilized 
the combined effect of the company s option  forward commitment and loan swap activity is included in the income statement as part of securities gains losses 
the company realized gains on that combined activity of  and  respectively  for the years ended september  and and realized losses of  for the year ended september  the notional amount of options and forward contracts outstanding varies and is a function of the current lending activity of salable mortgage loans 
in order to limit the risks which may be associated with such financial options or futures  the company s investment policy limits the amount of outstanding sold puts or calls used to manage the company s trading portfolio to million

total interest bearing liabilities   liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings from the fhlb  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and principal and interest payments on mortgage backed and related securities and on debt and equity securities 
although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  mortgage prepayments and prepayments on mortgage backed and related securities are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
mortgage loan and mortgage security prepayments were generally higher during and because of the generally lower level of interest rates throughout those years 
the ratio of liquid assets to deposits and short term borrowings required by the ots is currently 
the bank s liquidity ratio was and at september  and  respectively 
the bank adjusts its liquidity levels in order to meet various funding needs and to meet its asset and liability management objectives 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid  short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september  and  liquid assets of the bank as defined in the ots regulations were million and million  respectively 
excess funds generally are invested in short term investments such as federal funds or overnight deposits at the fhlb 
the company has found brokered certificates of deposit to be an efficient source and a cost effective method  relative to local retail market deposits  of meeting the company s funding needs 
management believes that a significant portion of its retail deposits will remain with the company  and in the case of brokered deposits  may be replaced with similar type accounts even should the level of interest rates change 
however  in the event of a significant increase in market interest rates  the cost of obtaining replacement brokered deposits would increase as well 
whenever the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available and obtained from borrowings from the fhlb 
funds also may be available through reverse repurchase agreements wherein the company pledges mortgage backed securities 
the company utilizes its borrowing capabilities on a regular basis 
at september   fhlb advances totaled million or of total liabilities and at september   fhlb advances were million or of total liabilities 
at september   the company had a borrowing capacity available of million from the fhlb 
at september   reverse repurchase agreements totaled million or of total liabilities compared with million at september  the company s reverse repurchase agreements are generally short term  with maturities of less than days 
in a rising interest rate environment  such short term borrowings present the risk that upon maturity  the borrowings will have to be replaced with higher rate borrowings 
the company generally has matched such borrowings to specific assets and has relatively little liquidity risk due to the fact that the assets and borrowings mature at approximately the same time 
the amount of principal repayments on loans and mortgage securities are heavily influenced by the general level of interest rates in the economy 
funds received from principal repayments on mortgage securities for the years ended september  and  were million and million  respectively 
funds received from principal repayments on loans for the years ended september  and  were million and million  respectively 
in addition to principal repayments  the company sells mortgage loans to government agencies primarily fnma and to institutional investors 
total mortgage loan sales to fnma and others were million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
through both origination and purchase  the company primarily reinvests funds received back into loans receivable and mortgage backed and related securities 
loan originations totaled million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
purchases of mortgage backed and related securities totaled zero and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
during the years ended september  and  the company repurchased approximately  and  shares of its common stock in share repurchase programs at a total cost of approximately million and million  respectively 
at september  and  the company had outstanding loan commitments including lines of credit of million and million  respectively 
the company had no commitments to purchase loans outstanding at either of these dates 
the company anticipates it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments  including loan applications received and in process prior to the issuance of firm commitments 
certificates of deposit  including brokered certificates  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less at september  and  were million and million  respectively 
management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the company 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation
