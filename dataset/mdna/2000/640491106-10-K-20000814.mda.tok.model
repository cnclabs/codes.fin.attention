these items have been substantially utilized which will result in tax expense approaching the statutory rate in future years 
the tax rate increased to from in as a result of these factors 
financial condition and liquidity at may  the company had  in cash and marketable securities  working capital of  and stockholders equity of  in addition  the company had unused bank lines of credit totaling  cash and marketable securities increased  during fiscal cash provided from operations  including the settlement of the vicam litigation totaling  was offset by the aggregate of the acquisition of acumedia manufacturers  inc for  the use of  for the purchase of  shares of the company s common stock see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements and  for purchases of property  equipment and other assets

at may   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation and changing prices have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s operations 
neogen has been profitable for of its last quarters and has generated positive cash from operations during the period 
management believes that the company s existing cash and marketable securities at may   along with available bank lines of credit and cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund activities for the foreseeable future 
however  existing cash and marketable securities may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to commercialize products currently under development or its plans to acquire additional technology and products that fit within the company s mission statement 
accordingly  the company may be required to issue equity securities or enter into other financing arrangements for a portion of the company s future capital needs
