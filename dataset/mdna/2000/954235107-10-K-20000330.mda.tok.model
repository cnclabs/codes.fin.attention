seasonality historically  the company s business has been highly seasonal 
the company s expansion into new markets has made it even more susceptible to seasonality  as an increasing percentage of stores sales occur in the second and third quarters of each year 
in  of the company s net sales and all of its net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through july  which represents the peak boating months in most of the company s markets 
management expects net sales to become more susceptible to seasonality and weather as the company continues to expand its operations 
business trends west marine s growth in net sales has been principally fueled by geographic expansion through the opening of new stores and  to a lesser extent  by comparable stores net sales increases 
although the company believes that the catalog and port supply divisions will continue to grow  future company net sales and profit growth  if any  will be increasingly dependent on the opening and profitability of new stores 
the company s catalog division continues to face market share erosion in markets where stores have been opened by either the company or competitors 
management expects that this trend may continue 
to address the growing significance of e commerce in the marketplace  the company redesigned its website to target all segments of boating enthusiasts 
since launching the site  sales have dramatically increased over sales 
the company has allocated resources to further develop the website to generate increases in international and domestic sales 
in most of the company s product categories  prices have remained stable or have declined over the last three years  a trend which management expects is likely to continue 
as a result  net sales increases during such periods have not been attributable to increases in prices 
in recent years  competition has increased which has adversely affected the company s gross profits 
these competitive and pricing pressures are likely to continue

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this filing that relate to future plans  events  expectations  objectives  or performance or assumptions underlying such matters are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
set forth below are certain important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
the company s catalog division has faced market share erosion in areas where stores have been open by either the company or its competitors 
management expects this trend to continue 
the company s growth has been fueled principally by the company s stores operations 
the company s continued growth depends to a significant degree on its ability to continue to expand its operations through the opening of new stores and to operate these stores profitably  as well as increasing net sales at its existing stores 
the company s planned expansion is subject to a number of factors  including the adequacy of the company s capital resources and the company s ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms  to hire  train and integrate employees and to adapt its distribution and other operations systems 
in addition  acquisitions involve a number of risks  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business  potential adverse short term effects on the company s operating results  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the markets for recreational watersports and boating supplies are highly competitive 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies have adversely affected the company s gross profit and such pressures are expected to continue 
in addition  the company s operations could be adversely affected if unseasonably cold weather  prolonged winter conditions or extraordinary amounts of rainfall were to occur during the peak boating season in the second and third quarters 
additional factors which may affect the company s financial results include inventory management issues  the impact of e commerce  fluctuations in consumer spending on recreational boating supplies  environmental regulations  demand for and acceptance of the company s products and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the company s sec filings
