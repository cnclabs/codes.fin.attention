overview risk of continued losses the company designs  manufactures and markets specialty and general purpose medical imaging systems for the diagnosis and treatment of disease 
the company s newer products are directed towards medical specialties  such as diagnosing and treating breast cancer  heart disease and vascular disease  in which image guided  minimally invasive therapies are replacing open surgical procedures 
except for the last nine months of  the first nine months of  the last three months of  and excluding the first quarter one time gain from the sale of a manufacturing license  the company has experienced significant losses since significant factors giving rise to recent losses include costs associated with excessive manufacturing capacity  intense competition for certain of the company s products  declining margins and demand for oem products  and a general slowdown in capital expenditures by hospitals 
the company cannot predict when it will return to profitability  although it has taken significant steps to reduce costs and improve sales  including 
entering into distribution partnerships in and with ethicon endo surgery for the marketing and sale of mammotest breast biopsy systems in the united states and in europe  
entering into a strategic alliance with direct radiography corp  a subsidiary of hologic  inc for the marketing and sale of digital radiography products see the strategic alliances heading of the business section of this form k  
closure of the company s addison  illinois manufacturing facility  and 
other actions to reduce operating expenses and manufacturing costs 
improvement in the company s results of operations will depend on many factors  including 
sufficient demand for the company s products to offset the effects of the reductions in oem business  
the adequacy of financial resources  
the company s ability to maintain or increase gross margins  
the effectiveness of efforts to control manufacturing and other costs  
effective negotiation and implementation of product distribution arrangements  
effective implementation of domestic and international marketing and sales strategies  and 
the development and introduction of new products that compete successfully 
because improved factory utilization was believed to be a key factor in returning to profitability  the company decided in the third quarter of to close its addison  illinois manufacturing facility and outsource or transfer addison production 
in january  the company fulfilled its remaining obligations for this facility by agreeing to a million lease buyout  completing the addison closure 
not all production had been successfully transferred  however  and in the second quarter of  the company accrued an additional  provision for the addison closure  principally for the discontinuing of a product line formerly produced in that facility  including related acceptance issues 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects continued significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues  operating results and net income  depending on such factors as 
delays in development projects  
the timing issues with respect to the receipt  manufacture  and shipment of large system product orders  
new product introductions or marketing initiatives by the company or its competitors  
the effects of managed healthcare on capital expenditures and reimbursement  
increases in marketing  research  and other costs in relation to sales  
regulatory clearance of new products  
the effect of general economic conditions of the company s markets  
seasonal patterns and other timing issues affecting customer purchasing decisions  and 
the outcome of claims against the company 
these factors can occur unexpectedly and  because many of the company s costs are fixed  the company may not be able to sufficiently reduce its costs in periods when revenues are less than anticipated and may  as a result  suffer unexpectedly larger losses 
over the past several years  the company has attempted to expand its international sales and marketing efforts  which had resulted in losses from its international operations until this year 
in  the company showed a profit internationally largely due to the distribution partnership with ethicon endo surgery 
additionally  the company s exposure to foreign currency and other international business risks may increase as its international business grows 
the company attempts to minimize these risks by generally requiring payments in us dollars  using letters of credit  and requiring advance deposits and through other means 
there can be no assurance  however  international sales efforts will be successful or that associated risks can be minimized 
international revenues declined substantially in and  but increased significantly during sales of the company s mammotest breast biopsy systems have fluctuated significantly in recent years  based on changes in competitive conditions 
for example  mammotest sales were lower in as compared to  due in part to aggressive competition within the surgical stereotactic core needle breast biopsy market from us surgical  which was then selling breast biopsy systems purchased from trex medical  the company s principal competitor in this market 
the company s sales in this market improved in  in part due to its marketing partnership with ethicon endo surgery 
in december  u 
s 
surgical decided to cease distributing breast biopsy systems and  therefore  terminated its supply agreement with trex medical 
while long term competitive conditions may become more favorable to the company  it is uncertain whether the near term impact on mammotest sales will be favorable or unfavorable 
in  sales in this market improved due to improved manufacturing efficiency and the continuing partnership with ethicon endo surgery 
the company s partner in developing digital imaging products for the general radiography market had been direct radiography corp  a subsidiary of sterling diagnostic imaging 
in early  the agfa gevaert group acquired direct radiography s parent company  sterling diagnostic imaging  inc direct radiography was not included in this acquisition  but was later sold to hologic corporation in june the company does not have a definitive agreement with direct radiography or hologic 
at this time the company cannot predict whether and if an agreement will be reached 
year update the company is not currently aware of  nor anticipates  any significant problems among its customers as a result of the failure of the company s products to differentiate between years in the s and years in the s 
in addition  the company did not experience any serious problems among the various computer systems used by the company and  to the best of the company s knowledge  none of its significant suppliers experienced and serious problems among the various computer systems used by such suppliers 
the company incurred no significant expenses with regards to the year project that fell outside of routine upgrades to desktop personal computers and hardware 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit is variable based on the prime rate and  is therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately million was outstanding with an interest rate of prime plus 
the line of credit is cancelable upon days notice by the lender 
on april   the company entered into a three year line of credit with a bank for million  which replaces the line of credit in place at december  borrowings under the new agreement will bear interest at the bank s prime rate  at march  if the interest rate on the company s line of credit had been higher than the rates in effect for its year ended december   the company would have incurred additional interest expense of approximately  for the year  with an associated 
increase in the per share loss for that year 
the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring interest rates which are available under other types of lending instruments and through other lenders 
foreign currency risk the company has wholly owned subsidiaries in australia  germany and france 
local assets and liabilities  principally intercompany debt to the parent company  are recorded in local currencies  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
these changes may positively or negatively affect the company s operating results 
as disclosed at note to notes to consolidated financial statements  revenues in foreign currency through all foreign subsidiaries constituted approximately of total revenues for the company 
the company therefore does not believe that foreseeable near term changes in exchange rates will have a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company and has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will prove to have been successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the applicable local currencies 
fda regulation the company is subject to periodic inspections by the food and drug administration  whose primary purpose is to audit the company s compliance with quality system regulations  which include testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
in march  the company s denver facility received a warning letter from the fda concerning documentation and other deficiencies 
the company rectified these deficiencies and resolved the matter with the fda in june in december  following an inspection of the denver facility  the fda issued inspectional observations form and a subsequent warning letter regarding manufacturing practices 
as required  the company responded as to planned corrective actions and obtained a favorable third party certification of manufacturing and quality systems 
in october  following a subsequent inspection  the fda issued a form regarding possible deficiencies in manufacturing  quality  and documentation practices 
the company submitted its response to the form and is instituting corrective actions 
failure to satisfy fda requirements can result in the company s inability to receive awards of federal government contracts  an inability to receive new marketing or export clearances  or fda enforcement actions including  among other things  product seizure  injunction  and or criminal or civil proceedings which could be initiated without further notice 
although the company strives to operate within fda requirements  there can be no assurance that deficiencies can be corrected or that the company can satisfy future fda compliance concerns 
sanctions resulting from fda compliance reviews or related delays in product clearances could have a material adverse effect on the company

partially offsetting this increase was an increase in unfavorable manufacturing costs from million in to million in research and development expenses

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses decreased to of total revenues in as compared to in the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to lower legal expenses in as compared to  partly offset by higher administrative expenses

income taxes the company s effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the and rates reflect increases of million and million  respectively  in the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
these increases are due mainly to uncertainty relating to the realizability of net deferred tax assets due to the company s recent history of net operating losses
