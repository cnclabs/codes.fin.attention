results of operations operating income  which excludes net realized gains and losses from security sales and one time items  was million  or per share  in  million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in the gaap combined ratio was in  in and in direct premiums written increased to  million in  compared to  million in and  million in net premiums written increased to  million in  compared to  million in and  million in the difference between direct and net premiums written is attributable to premiums written under state mandated involuntary commercial auto insurance procedures  for which the company retains no indemnity risk  of million in  million in and million in  and reinsurance the company maintains in its auto and non auto programs and its strategic alliance relationships 
premiums earned  which are a function of the amount of premiums written in the current and prior periods  increased in  compared to in and in net premiums written in the company s personal lines business units  which write insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreation vehicles and represented of the company s total premiums written  grew  and in  and  respectively  primarily reflecting an increase in unit sales 
the company decreased rates an average of during the first six months of  and increased rates in the second half of the year  for an annual rate increase of in  compared to rate decreases of and 
in and  respectively 
the company expects that these rate increases will likely slow volume growth in and  since nearly two thirds of the company s new auto policies are on an annual term  the company does not expect to see the full impact of these rate changes until the fourth quarter of the personal lines business is generated either by an agent or written directly by the company 
the agent channel includes business written by the company s network of  independent insurance agents and through strategic alliance business relationships other insurance companies  financial institutions  employers and national brokerage agencies 
total net premiums written through independent agents and strategic alliance agency relationships were  million in  compared to  million in and  million in the combined ratios for the agency channel were  and for  and  respectively 
direct business includes business written through auto pro r  the internet progressive 
com and the strategic alliance business unit on behalf of affinity groups 
net premiums written and combined ratio on the direct business were million and  respectively  in  compared to million and in and million and in the sales generated via the internet represented approximately and of the direct business net premiums written for and  respectively  the company started selling insurance directly over the internet in august through these multiple distribution channels  the company continues to write standard and preferred risks  which represented between and of total personal lines volume  compared to between and in and between and in  as well as its traditional nonstandard auto products 
claim costs  the company s most significant expense  represent actual payments made and changes in estimated future payments to be made to or on behalf of its policyholders  including expenses required to settle claims and losses 
these costs include a loss estimate for future assignments and assessments  based on current business  under state mandated involuntary automobile programs 
claim costs are influenced by inflation and loss severity and frequency  the impact of which is mitigated by adequate pricing 
increases in the rate of inflation increase loss payments  which are made after premiums are established 
accordingly  anticipated rates of inflation are taken into account when the company establishes premium rates and loss reserves 
claim costs  expressed as a percentage of premiums earned  were in  compared to in and in the increase in the loss ratios was driven by the factors discussed below 
four factors contributed to the company s underwriting losses during the second half of and its inability to meet its traditional goals in the first factor was that  during  the company reduced loss reserves relating to prior accident years million  or 
points  compared to million  or points  and million  or points  for and  respectively 
the second factor was continued strong growth in the direct business in in periods of rapid growth in the direct business  the company s earnings may be lower as a result of higher up front costs and higher loss costs traditionally associated with new business 
in response  the company decided to return to profit targets based on a calendar year measure rather than over the entire retention period of a policyholder  with the intent to bring the combined ratio back to the historic goal of over the next few years 
the company s profit and growth opportunities change from year to year  however  over every consecutive year period  the company strives to produce a four percent underwriting profit and to grow at percentage points greater than the rate of inflation 
the third factor was that the company lowered rates in and during the first half of  in an attempt to raise its combined ratio to while achieving its growth target 
lastly  during  loss trend accelerated at an unanticipated pace  consequently  loss costs rose faster than expected 
the company expects these loss costs trends to continue 
in  actual trend for pricing exceeded estimates 
similarly  the emerging loss development is greater than anticipated primarily for the losses  which led to the company experiencing approximately points of adverse development during the first two months of during march  the company undertook a comprehensive review of those reserve segments that have shown the most development and intends to adjust the reserves accordingly 
the company s other lines of business include writing insurance for small fleets of commercial vehicles  collateral protection and loan tracking for auto lenders and financial institutions  directors and officers liability and fidelity coverage for american bankers association member community banks and independent credit unions  and providing related claim  underwriting and system services 
revenues in these businesses were million in  compared to million in and million in pretax operating profit was million in  compared to million in and million in the company writes directors and officers and other professional liability coverage for community banks and credit unions and  therefore  could potentially be exposed to liability for errors made by these institutions relating to the year conversion 
the company has reinsurance to limit its potential exposure to approximately of the average policy limits in the event any of the insured directors or officers are held liable for year noncompliance by their financial institutions 
it is currently unknown whether these financial institutions have been able to completely avoid errors relating to year compliance and the company is unable to predict to what extent such financial institutions will incur losses as a result of noncompliance and whether their directors and officers will be subject to individual liability for such noncompliance 
in the event of a claim  applicable factual and coverage issues would have to be resolved 
based on information currently available and management s best estimate  the company does not believe that any losses resulting from this exposure will have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
because the company is primarily an insurer of motor vehicles  it has limited exposure for environmental  product and general liability claims 
the company has established reserves for these exposures  in amounts which it believes to be adequate based on information currently known by it 
management does not believe that these claims will have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums earned were in  and the company advertises locally in states  plus washington dc markets  as compared to states markets in and states markets in the company expanded its television advertising campaign on a national level during during  the company incurred advertising expenses of million  compared to million in and million in recurring investment income interest and dividends increased to million in  compared to million in and million in  primarily due to an increase in the size of the investment portfolio 
net realized gains on security sales were million in  million in and million in investment expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in year compliance the company s five year effort to achieve year compliance was successful 
the company successfully operated through the rollover to year with only minor issues and has not experienced any significant business outage or incurred any significant cost due to the year failure or errors of business partners to date 
the total cost to modify existing production systems  which includes both internal and external costs of programming  coding and testing  was million  of which million had been expensed through december  the company also replaced some of its systems 
in addition to being year compliant  these new systems added increased functionality to the company 
the majority of the projects were completed in  with remaining parallel testing completed during the first half of as of december   million  which include both internal and external costs  had been paid for these systems 
all costs were funded through operating cash flows 
the company continually evaluates computer hardware and software upgrades for enhancements and  therefore  many of the costs to replace these items to be year compliant were not incremental costs to the company 
in preparing for the rollover to the st century  the company s process teams and business groups identified potential year scenarios 
for those scenarios deemed to be both probable and with a potentially significant business impact  the company developed contingency plans 
these plans were reviewed by the company s chief financial and technology officers throughout it has not been necessary to execute any of the contingency plans to date
