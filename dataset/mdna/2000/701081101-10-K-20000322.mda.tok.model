item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook and overview the loss reported for the year ended december  reflects the continued weakness in most of the company s drilling markets which has resulted in a significant decrease in rig utilization and in dayrates since mid lower crude oil prices throughout and into early negatively impacted the revenues and profits of oil operators  who responded by reducing exploration and development expenditures 
this decline in spending adversely affected the level of oilfield activity  and in turn  the revenues of most companies in the oilfield services industry 
although crude oil and natural gas prices have increased recently  oil operators have been slow to increase their exploration and development spending 
management is unable to predict the timing and extent that spending by operators  rig dayrates and utilization will be positively affected by the increase in crude oil prices 
management anticipates that the company will continue to incur losses until there is a significant increase in the level of oilfield activity 
management believes  however  that cash on hand  cash provided by operations and funds available under the company s new revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet working capital needs and maintenance capital expenditures 
during  the company restructured the management of its worldwide drilling operations eliminating approximately million in overhead and operating costs 
in addition  management has preserved cash by minimizing capital expenditures 
the company also sold certain of its non strategic assets and is considering the sale of additional non strategic assets 
on september  the company sold its lower land drilling rigs to unit corporation for million cash plus one million shares of unit common stock 
during the fourth quarter the company sold its argentina land rigs and inventories previously classified as assets held for disposition plus one additional bolivia land rig for approximately million

the primary uses of cash in were million for capital expenditures net of reimbursements and million for repayment of debt 
major projects during the year included the modification of barge rig for a contract in the caspian sea and the construction of a new barge  rig  for a contract in nigeria 
reimbursements from the operator to offset a portion of the expenditures to modify rig are reflected as a reduction in capital expenditures in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
at year end both rigs were drawing daily revenues at their respective locations 
other major expenditures included the modification of two barge rigs for a contract with texaco in the transition zones of the gulf of mexico  the completion of a new support facility in new iberia  louisiana  and commencement of modifications to rig for a contract to begin in the second half of in kazakhstan

in addition  the company may seek project financing or equity participation from outside alliance partners or customers 
the company cannot predict whether such financing or equity participation would be available on terms acceptable to the company 
other matters business risks internationally  the company specializes in drilling in remote locations and under difficult geological or operating conditions 
the company s international services are primarily utilized by international and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
domestically  the company primarily drills offshore in the gulf of mexico with barge  jackup and platform rigs 
business activity is dependent on the exploration and development activities of the major  independent and national oil and gas companies that make up the company s customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities  and consequently do not materially affect the operations of the company 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities which in turn could materially affect the company s operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on the company s international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on domestic operations 
year the company began preparing for year in by replacing critical financial  human resources and payroll systems with year compliant off the shelf software 
the year problem was not the main reason for upgrading the information technology platform  however  it was beneficial in achieving year compliance 
the company also prepared contingency plans to cover failures in its supply chain  communications  civil disturbances and information technology systems 
the company estimates that  was spent during and in its year compliance efforts 
while the majority of those costs were internal salaries  the company s process for tracking internal costs did not capture all of the costs incurred for each individual task on the project 
during the year date transition  the company did not experience any material failure with its information technology or non information technology systems or key customers or suppliers 
the company will continue to monitor mission critical applications  processes and vendors throughout the year for any latent issues that may arise 
other matters continued change in fiscal year on july   the company decided to change its fiscal year end from august to december  effective january  the company filed a quarterly report on form q with the securities and exchange commission covering the transition period of september  to december  indonesian operations the current political and currency instability in indonesia has created uncertainty regarding the company s indonesian operations 
the company provides management  technical and training support to an indonesian owned drilling contractor  whose services include the drilling of geothermal wells related to power plant projects 
due to the uncertain economic conditions  certain of these power plant projects have been postponed or delayed 
as a result  payments from a significant customer for services provided by the indonesian contractor have been delayed 
the indonesian contractor initiated two arbitration proceedings in late to collect these delinquent payments 
recently  the arbitration panel awarded the contractor approximately million including interest in the first proceeding 
the contractor has advised it will vigorously pursue collection of this award and prosecution of a second arbitration proceeding in which the contractor is claiming approximately million
