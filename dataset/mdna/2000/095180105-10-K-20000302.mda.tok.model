operating results twelve months ended december   compared to twelve months ended december sales for were million compared to million for operating income from segments for was million compared to million for for  income before extraordinary loss was million 
per share before accounting for after tax merger costs of million 
per share and non recurring costs of million 
per share 
this compares to income before extraordinary loss of million 
per share in these results reflect a significant reduction in sales and operating income from the industrial and power equipment segment due to adverse market conditions  manufacturing problems at the prentice facility which adversely impacted productivity and costs associated with the plant consolidation and realignment program  and improved results from the sporting equipment segment and outdoor products segment 
corporate expenses include a donation of art with a book value of million in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
merger expenses of million were incurred in compared to million in for a summary description of the merger  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the expense associated with the donation of art and merger expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in compared to these decreases reflect cost reduction efforts at each segment and the corporate office 
higher interest expense for reflects higher long term debt levels during the current year resulting from the transaction described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective income tax rate in reflects the donation of art and the non deductible portion of the expenses associated with the merger 
the principal reasons for these results and the status of the company s financial condition are set forth below 
sales of the outdoor products segment for were million compared to million in operating income was million in compared to million the prior year 
sales reflect a higher volume of sales of lawn mowers and accessories and from flat to slightly lower sales of other product lines as indicated in the following table in millions increase decrease in chain saw components 
lawn mowers and accessories other 
total segment sales the improvement in operating income is primarily due to the higher sales of lawn mowers and accessories and the positive effect of favorable exchange rates in brazil which adds approximately million 
page sales for the sporting equipment segment were up significantly to million from million the prior year 
operating income improved to million from million the previous year 
these results reflect a higher volume for ammunition and related components  sports optics and other products  partially offset by competitive pricing actions required during the last half of the current year in one of this segment s products 
sales by the segment s principal product groups were as follows in millions increase decrease in ammunition related products sports optical products other total segment sales additionally in the second half of  the sporting equipment segment completed certain cost reduction activities by consolidating its raw materials purchasing and sales and marketing organizations  transferring certain production to lower cost facilities and eliminating certain outsourcing 
annual savings of million from these efforts were realized in the company s industrial and power equipment segment is a cyclical  capital goods business whose results are closely linked to the strength of the forestry industry in general 
a key indicator of this segment s market is the price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp which declined from an average of per metric ton in the fourth quarter of to an average of per metric ton in per metric ton in the first quarter  per metric ton in the second quarter  per metric ton in the third quarter and per metric ton in the fourth quarter  resulting in depressed market conditions characterized by significant sales declines in the company s most important market the southeastern united states and the need to offer discounts in response to extremely aggressive competition for available sales 
operating results of this segment were adversely affected by these poor market conditions in sales by the segment s principal product groups were as follows in millions increase decrease in timber harvesting and loading equipment gear components and rotation bearings total segment sales this segment incurred an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in primarily due to sharply reduced demand and manufacturing problems at the prentice facility which increased costs 
in response to weak market conditions and to improve capacity utilization  the company implemented a program of production consolidation and realignments in this segment to lower costs and improve productivity 
one manufacturing facility was closed during the first half of with its production shifted to other company plants 
another small facility was closed during the third quarter of with its production outsourced 
costs of approximately million related to these plant closings were charged to page operations during management anticipates annual cost savings of approximately million beginning in the third quarter of as a result of these actions 
with recent pulp price increases  low pulp inventory levels  increased demand for pulp and paper products from the economic recovery of southeast asia  improved order backlog and improved performance in the fourth quarter of  management is cautiously optimistic of continued improvement in the near future  although the extent and timing of further improvement is highly uncertain 
if the current slowdown were to continue  it would be unlikely this segment could achieve historical levels of sales and profitability 
the company s total backlog increased to million at december   from million at december   as follows in millions increase in outdoor products sporting equipment industrial and power equipment total management continuously reviews for potential cost reductions 
in addition to cost savings efforts commented on elsewhere within management s discussion and analysis  studies are underway to evaluate distribution processes and distribution facility needs 
these studies are expected to be completed in while no assurance can be given that savings can be achieved until these studies are completed  management estimates that potential annual savings will range from million to million with implementation expenses estimated at million to million 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates 
twelve months ended december   compared to twelve months ended december despite economic problems in some markets  the company achieved record results in sales in were million compared to million in income before extraordinary loss was million 
per share in compared to million 
per share in net income of million 
per share for reflects a net extraordinary loss of million 
per share on the redemption of long term debt 
the higher sales and improved operating results in are primarily due to the full year contribution to the sporting equipment segment by federal cartridge company federal which was acquired during the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales in compared to in total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in primarily due to federal being included in operating results for the entire year 
higher interest expense in reflects higher debt levels during the current year  principally due to the federal acquisition 
total backlog was million at december   compared to million at december  the current year backlog is lower at each of the company s operating segments with the largest decrease at the industrial and power equipment segment  principally reflecting reduced demand for timber harvesting and industrial equipment 
the company expects a challenging year in as economic conditions in southeast asia and south america and low pulp prices and high mill inventories are likely to impact the demand for the page industrial and power equipment segment s timber harvesting equipment 
the industrial and power equipment segment has implemented production and cost control measures to help mitigate the effect of the reduction in demand 
in  the sporting equipment segment should continue to benefit from the acquisition of federal and related consolidation and cost reduction activities 
sales and operating income for the outdoor products segment for were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million during the operating results for this segment reflect a decrease in sales and operating income of million and million  respectively  at the company s oregon cutting systems division oregon and higher sales and operating income at dixon industries  inc dixon 
oregon s results reflect an approximate million sales decrease in southeast asia and the far east  primarily due to the economic problems in those areas  which has contributed to an approximate reduction in the sales volume of cutting chain and chain saw guide bars  oregon s principal products 
oregon has foreign manufacturing or distribution operations in canada  europe  brazil  japan and russia 
the company estimates that foreign currency exchange rates in  as compared to  provided a favorable impact on operating income of approximately million 
during  operating income from brazil was million compared to million during dixon s sales and operating income improved in compared to the prior year due to higher volume and more favorable weather conditions 
sales and operating income for the sporting equipment segment were million and million  respectively  in compared to million and million in the significant improvement in sales and operating income reflect the sales and income added by federal which was acquired during the fourth quarter of total sales and operating income at other sporting equipment operations were flat in as compared to the prior year 
sales and operating income for the industrial and power equipment segment were down to million and million  respectively  in from million and million in the results for reflect reduced demand for timber harvesting equipment resulting principally from sharply lower pulp prices since mid year and higher mill inventories  higher competitive discounts and higher warranty costs 
the operating results for this segment s gear products  inc subsidiary gear improved slightly in compared to financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december   as a result of the recapitalization transactions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant amounts of debt  with interest payments on the notes and interest and principal payments under the new credit facilities representing significant obligations for the company 
the notes require semi annual interest payments and the term loan facilities under the new credit facilities require payments of principal commencing on december  interest on the term loan facilities and amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are payable in arrears according to varying interest periods 
the company s remaining liquidity needs relate to working capital needs  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions 
the company intends to fund working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements through cash flows generated from operations and from the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has an availability of up to million 
letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility which reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility were million at december  the revolving credit facility will mature august  page management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs  including financing for acquisitions  in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be the case 
the company may also consider other options available to it in connection with future liquidity needs 
the company has senior notes outstanding in the principal amount of million which mature in the company also has senior subordinated notes outstanding in the principal amount of million which mature in and senior term loans outstanding in the principal amount of million which mature at various dates through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the terms and conditions of the senior notes  the senior subordinated notes and senior term loans 
cash balances at december   were million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million the prior year  principally due to a net income decrease of million 
working capital decreased million to million  compared to million last year 
accounts receivable increased by million  notes payable and current maturities of long term debt by million  accounts payable by million  and accrued expenses by million 
inventories decreased million 
the notes payable and current maturities of long term debt increase reflects million of new term loans and million from short term foreign lines of credit 
the accounts payable increase reflects purchases principally related to the higher level of business in the fourth quarter and the extension of payments to partially offset higher receivables 
the increase in accrued expenses principally reflects the increased interest on the additional debt 
the accounts receivable increase reflects higher sales by all three segments as compared to the fourth quarter of and extended terms used as a marketing tool by the sporting equipment segment and the industrial and power equipment segment 
accounts receivable at december   and december   and sales by segment for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of were as follows in millions december  december  increase accounts receivable outdoor products sporting equipment industrial and power equipment total segment receivables three months ended december  december  increase sales outdoor products sporting equipment industrial and power equipment total segment sales page the higher sales by the outdoor products segment are the principal reason for the increase in that segment s receivables as compared to year end 
because of the seasonal nature of the sporting equipment business  the need to produce and ship efficiently in order to ensure an adequate supply during peak sales periods and in response to competitor programs  the company offers extended payment terms within its sporting equipment segment in advance of the fall hunting season 
as a result  receivables tend to peak in september and reach their low point in january of each year 
at december   extended term receivables were million greater than at december  in addition  the higher sales occurred late in the quarter and result in increased receivables 
the industrial and power equipment segment sales reflect the adverse market conditions described in operating results 
recently  this segment has begun to see improvement in its market as reflected in the increased backlog of million at december   compared to million at december  sales increases during the fourth quarter are further evidence of this improvement 
in response to the adverse market conditions  this segment began offering in the fourth quarter of payment terms of  and  in some cases  days to certain dealers based on their financial strength 
at december   there were approximately million in receivables with extended terms compared to million at december  the sales increase of million for the month of december compared to december and a collection of million the first of january for amounts due at the end of december from the two largest customers are the primary reasons for the increase in receivables 
the company has absorbed the increased receivables through operating cash flows and  given historical operating cash flows  the company expects operating cash flows will be sufficient to cover any further increases until market conditions in the industrial and power equipment segment further improve and terms return to those normally extended 
no material adverse effect on the operations  liquidity or capital resources of the company is expected as a result of the extended terms 
cash used in investing activities in was million  reflecting principally purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
cash used in financing activities in was million  principally reflecting million from the issuance of senior subordinated notes and senior term loans  and capital contribution of million partially offset by the redemption of common stock of  million  the payment of dividends of million  and payment of long term debt of million 
immediately after the merger transaction described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company became substantially leveraged which may adversely affect its operations 
this substantial leverage could have important consequences for the company  including the following the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired or that kind of financing may not be on favorable terms  a substantial portion of cash flows available from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest expense  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in net income and cash flows or an increase in expenses may make it difficult to meet debt service requirements or force the company to modify operations  and page substantial leverage may make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressure 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivatives 
when utilized  derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
see interest rate risk and commodity price risk below for discussion of expectations as regards future use of interest rate and commodity price derivatives 
interest rate risk the company manages its ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
historically  the company has  on occasion  entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and has entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue 
at december   no derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt outstanding at december   by million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt for a duration of one year would increase interest expense by approximately million in under its credit agreement  the company is required to enter into hedge agreements within days of the borrowing and maintain such hedge agreements in place until the second anniversary of the borrowing  such that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the borrowings are subject to a fixed rate of interest 
the company will have in place by february   an interest rate cap at an immaterial cost to comply with this requirement 
foreign currency exchange risk approximately of oregon s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of oregon s reported sales and operating income 
historically  the company s principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in canada and local currency sales in europe principally france and germany 
during the past three years  the company has not used derivatives to manage any significant foreign currency exchange risk and  at december   no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding 
commodity price risk during  the company purchased approximately million pounds of brass for use in its sporting equipment operations 
while the company has in previous years hedged approximately of these purchases and may in the current or future years hedge these purchases if the price trend is such that it could have a material effect on financial condition or results of operations  no futures contracts to manage this price risk were entered into in because there are no copper and zinc contracts outstanding at december   an immediate hypothetical decrease in the futures prices of copper and zinc would have no effect on fair value 
in addition  a large quantity of other metals principally lead were purchased by sporting equipment operations in derivatives were not used to manage this price risk 
page impact of year issue the company evaluated its internal date sensitive systems and equipment for year compliance 
the assessment phase included both information technology equipment and non information technology equipment 
based on its assessment  the company determined that it was necessary to modify or replace a portion of its information systems and other equipment 
the modification or replacement and testing of the critical software  hardware and equipment requiring remediation was completed and mitigated successfully the effect of the year issue 
the company s operations incurred no disruption of their ability to manufacture and ship products  process financial transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
likewise  the company experienced no significant problems with its non information technology systems 
the total estimated cost of the year project  including system upgrades  was approximately million and was funded by operating cash flows 
as of december   all costs had been incurred 
of the total cost of the project  approximately million was attributable to new software and equipment  which was capitalized 
the remaining costs were expensed as incurred 
the company experienced no significant problems with key suppliers and customers as a result of the year issue 
where needed  the company established contingency plans based on actual testing results and assessment of outside risks  however  it was not necessary to implement any contingency plan 
the above statement in its entirety is designated a year readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value and establishes specific criteria for the use of hedge accounting 
the company s required adoption date is january  sfas no 
is not to be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the company expects no material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows upon adoption of sfas no 
 but does expect a small reduction in stockholders equity 
forward looking statements forward looking statements in this report  as defined by the private securities litigation reform law of  involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as of the date of this report
