item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of technologically advanced electronic interconnect solutions for use in sophisticated electronic equipment 
our principal products are complex multilayer printed circuit boards  which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors  integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of electronic products and systems 
our fiscal year consists of either the or week period ending on the last saturday in may 
fiscal years  and were week years 
for convenience  all of our fiscal years are presented as ended on may results of operations dollars in thousands results of operations information in dollars and as a percentage of net sales are as follows years ended may  percentage of net sales net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses engineering    selling  general and administrative    restructuring   total operating expenses    operating income loss    interest income  interest expense    other income expense  net income loss before taxes    income tax expense benefit    net income loss    comparison of fiscal years and net sales our net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of from net sales of million in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily the result of higher levels of demand from new and existing customers as the electronic equipment industry recovered from the downturn of additionally  as a result of a favorable sales mix  including increased levels of advanced technology printed circuit boards and quick turn printed circuit boards  our average selling prices rose in the latter half of fiscal in the last half of fiscal  we began to experience increased customer demand and an increased customer focus on the availability of capacity rather than product price 
future product pricing is dependent on a variety of factors including continued strength of customer orders  capacity utilization in the printed circuit board industry  competition from domestic printed circuit board companies and potential future competition from asian printed circuit board companies 
net sales in fiscal included five months of sales from our loveland manufacturing facility million  which we closed in october  and nine months of sales from our soladyne manufacturing facility million  which we sold in february sales in the communications market segment increased in dollars and as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of continued strong demand for data communications  primarily associated with the growth of the internet  and increasing use of wireless communications 
see business markets and customers 
our five largest oem customers represented of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal our sales to oems include sales made through contract manufacturers 
our sales to contract manufacturers were of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal three customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  and four customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal see business markets and customers and backlog 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  was in fiscal and in fiscal gross profit increased in fiscal primarily as a result of higher capacity utilization  a favorable product mix and cost reductions 
in the latter half of fiscal  we began to experience high capacity utilization rates due to increased demand  particularly from our customers in the data communications and wireless communications markets 
our product mix was favorable because we produced a greater number of advanced technology printed circuit boards and quick turn printed circuit boards  which provide significantly higher gross margins 
our cost reductions consisted of higher production yields  manufacturing process improvements and lower raw material costs because of better supplier arrangements 
gross margin in fiscal was negatively affected by a million write off of inventory related to the restructuring discussed below 
in addition  because of the downturn in the electronic equipment industry in  our capacity utilization in fiscal was significantly below our historical capacity utilization levels 
engineering our engineering expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and of our net sales in those periods 
engineering expenses were reduced in fiscal as a result of the capitalization of  in engineering labor expenses related to the forest grove expansion project 
these costs are being amortized over approximately seven years  commencing in fiscal selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and of our net sales in those periods 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses resulting from a larger sales force and higher commissions on greater net sales  and to a lesser extent  increased general and administrative expenses generally resulting from the growth of the company 
restructuring in the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve capacity utilization and lower our cost structure 
we closed our loveland  colorado facility in october and laid off approximately manufacturing and support employees located there  sold our soladyne facility in san diego  california and laid off approximately employees from administrative  engineering and support functions at our forest grove  oregon location 
we also transferred a portion of the manufacturing equipment used in the loveland facility to our forest grove site 
installation of the manufacturing equipment was completed in december in the third quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of the restructuring expense taken in the first quarter of fiscal  primarily because lease termination costs at loveland were million less than we had anticipated  we were able to realize a higher value on inventory that we had previously written down and we realized million more from the sale of equipment than we had expected 
we also spent less on severance benefits than we expected 
interest income interest income remained relatively flat at  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal interest expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from capitalizing interest of approximately  in fiscal  partially offset by lower interest expense in fiscal the capitalized interest related to the forest grove expansion project and is being amortized over approximately seven years  commencing in fiscal the lower interest expense in fiscal resulted from million of principal payments made during the year 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  was  in fiscal  and  in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred finance charges of  in connection with the restructuring of our senior unsecured notes and retired manufacturing equipment 
in addition  during  we received a settlement payment 
income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to approximate 
the net operating losses we incurred in fiscal were carried forward to offset our taxable income for fiscal the internal revenue service has examined our federal income tax returns for fiscal years  and their proposed adjustments are principally related to the timing of deductions 
we are currently appealing some of their proposed adjustments 
we expect the resolution of these issues to result in the payment of previously deferred federal and state income taxes plus interest on these taxes 
these tax and interest payments could range from million to million 
these payments are not expected to affect income tax expense 
comparison of fiscal years and net sales our net sales were million in fiscal  a decrease of from net sales of million in fiscal the decrease in net sales in fiscal was primarily a result of lower unit sales and lower average selling prices  which resulted from a general electronic equipment industry downturn  pricing pressures in the printed circuit board industry  excess customer inventories  the closure of our loveland manufacturing facility in october and the sale of our soladyne manufacturing facility in february our five largest oem customers comprised of our net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal our sales to oems include sales made through contract manufacturers 
approximately of our net sales were through contract manufacturers in fiscal compared to in fiscal four customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  and three customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal gross profit our gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin resulted from lower capacity utilization  lower product pricing  and the effect of the million net write down of inventory related to our restructuring expense 
our gross margin began to improve in the last half of fiscal  primarily as a result of increased sales of higher margin products  increased capacity utilization of our forest grove manufacturing facility  lower costs as a result of headcount reductions from our restructuring in fiscal  and other cost reduction actions  such as higher production yields  manufacturing process improvements and lower raw materials costs 
engineering our engineering expenses were million in fiscal and million in  respectively  representing and of our net sales in those periods 
the decrease in engineering expenses resulted from reduced headcount  cost controls and the capitalization of approximately  of dedicated engineering labor related to our forest grove expansion project during fiscal  which is being amortized over approximately seven years  commencing in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and of our net sales in those periods 
the absolute decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was as a result of reduced headcount resulting from our restructurings in fiscal and fiscal  cost controls and reduced selling expenses as a result of lower net sales 
restructuring as discussed above  we incurred a net restructuring expense of million in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the costs associated with a restructuring plan undertaken to improve our profitability  which included a work force reduction  the write off of manufacturing equipment and other miscellaneous costs 
all liabilities associated with the restructuring plan were paid in the third quarter of fiscal interest income interest income declined to  in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily because we had lower levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during fiscal interest expense interest expense declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily because we capitalized interest of approximately  related to the forest grove expansion project in fiscal  which is being amortized over approximately seven years  commencing in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net  was  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  we received a settlement payment and ceased amortizing goodwill for our loveland  colorado facility  which was written off in connection with the restructuring in fiscal this positively affected our other income expense  net in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately in fiscal compared to in our effective rate for fiscal was higher than our effective tax rate in fiscal because in fiscal we received a rebate of excess oregon state income taxes collected in prior years 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in may  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock the offering 
the offering included  shares sold by the company and  million shares sold by a shareholder of the company  and resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income for the period and adjustments for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes  offset principally by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
deferred income taxes decreased primarily as a result of the utilization of net operating losses in fiscal accounts receivable and inventories increased as a result of a higher level of sales and production in fiscal cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was million 
cash provided by investing activities primarily included maturities of short term investments and net proceeds from the sale leaseback of equipment  offset by capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment 
we had capital commitments of approximately million as of may   primarily for manufacturing equipment 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  which primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by a principal payment on our senior unsecured notes 
in august  we entered into a lease agreement  which allowed us to sell and leaseback up to million of manufacturing equipment 
as of may   we had sold approximately million of equipment under this agreement 
gains resulting from these sales were deferred and are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
the lease is classified as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we have a secured note payable to tektronix with million outstanding at may   which bears interest at per year 
a principal payment of million was made in june and million is payable in june we have million outstanding under senior unsecured notes held by two insurance companies  with interest payable semi annually 
semi annual principal payments of million began in september  with a final principal payment of million due in september the notes contain certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  debt ratio and interest coverage and a make whole provision covering potential prepayment penalties 
as of may   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in march  we obtained an million unsecured line of credit from a bank  which expires in february borrowings under this line of credit would bear interest at the bank s prime rate or alternative libor based rates available at the time of borrowing 
to date  we have not made any borrowings under this line of credit 
capacity expansion in the third quarter of fiscal  we initiated an expansion plan to increase our production capacity and our technological capabilities 
by the end of fiscal  we had completed the first phase of the expansion plan  which included converting non manufacturing space to manufacturing space and adding new equipment  at a cost of approximately million 
by december  we had completed the second phase of the expansion plan  which included transferring equipment from our loveland facility to forest grove with an installation cost of approximately million 
in march  we announced the third phase of our expansion plan  which is expected to increase our plant capacity through the addition of new equipment and square footage at our forest grove facility  at a cost of approximately million 
we expect this expansion to increase our production capacity by approximately 
a portion of this new capacity is expected to be completed in the fall of  with the full project expected to be completed in late spring in july  we announced a further capacity expansion which will include a new  square foot leased facility located in the portland  oregon metropolitan area  which is expected to increase our production capacity by approximately 
a portion of this capacity will be completed in late  with the full capacity expected to be available in the summer of upon the completion of this expansion project and the expansion project announced in march  we expect that our manufacturing facilities will be able to support a revenue run rate of approximately to million annually 
we expect to fund our expansion projects with a combination of the proceeds from the offering  internally generated funds and lease financing 
our planned capacity expansions involve significant risks 
for example  we may encounter construction delays  equipment delays  labor shortages or disputes and production start up problems that could prevent us from meeting our customers delivery schedules 
we also expect to incur new fixed operating expenses associated with our expansion efforts  including increases in depreciation expenses and lease expenses 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently to offset these expenses  our operating results may be harmed 
in addition  the electronics industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and over capacity 
the electronics industry is likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
unfavorable economic conditions affecting the electronics industry in general  or any of our major customers  may affect our ability to successfully utilize our additional manufacturing capacity in an effective manner  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we believe that our existing capital resources and cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
risk factors affecting business and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology including could  may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue  the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks described below and those listed from time to time in our other securities and exchange commission reports or otherwise disclosed by us 
these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report  to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
because a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline if we lose a major customer or if a major customer demands less of our products or cancels or delays orders 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
our top five oem customers represented  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cisco systems  motorola  and teradyne each accounted for more than of our net sales 
we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of or decrease in orders from one or more major customers could reduce our revenues 
if economic conditions decrease demand for electronic products or adversely affect the market for electronic products  we could experience reduced sales and lower gross margins 
our business depends on the electronics industry  which is subject to intense competition  rapid technological change  short product life cycles and pricing and margin pressures 
when these factors adversely affect our customers  we may suffer similar effects 
our customers are primarily manufacturers in the communications  computing and test and measurement segments of the electronics industry 
at any time  our customers can discontinue or modify products containing components manufactured by us 
this discontinuance or modification could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  the electronics industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and over capacity 
for example  the economic downturn in asia in had a negative effect on the prices of electronic products as demand for electronic products and components declined and price competition escalated 
the electronic industry is likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting the electronics industry  in general  or any of our major customers  in particular  may adversely affect our operating results 
if we lose key personnel  we could experience reduced sales  delayed product development and diversion of management resources 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment or non compete agreements with our key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management were to resign  the loss of personnel could result in loss of sales  delays in new product development and diversion of management resources 
we do not maintain key man insurance policies on any of our personnel and do not require our personnel to enter into non competition agreements with us 
if we are not able to retain or attract employees with sufficient know how to conduct our manufacturing processes  we may not be able to maintain or increase our production output and quality 
manufacturing printed circuit boards requires employees with sufficient know how to operate advanced equipment and to conduct sensitive and complicated manufacturing processes 
there is intense competition for these types of employees 
we have been successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of these employees in our operations to date 
in the future  we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of these employees for our existing operations or our planned expanded operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future for a variety of reasons  including the following price and product competition  the timing and volume of our customers orders  changes in the mix of products we sell  the levels at which we utilize our manufacturing capacity  our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  difficulties we may face integrating acquired operations  costs associated with adding new geographical locations or expanding our facilities  manufacturing process yields  raw material availability  and shortages of experienced labor 
each of these factors has had in the past  and may have in the future  an adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant portion of our operations expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
any inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any revenue shortfalls may magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfalls on our results of operations 
as a result  our operating results may vary significantly from one quarter to the next 
acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  divert management resources or dilute shareholder value 
as part of our business strategy  we may make acquisitions of  or investments in  companies  products or technologies that complement our current products  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or production capacity or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with these acquisitions or investments  we could issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume liabilities  and incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or incur large and immediate write offs 
future acquisitions also could pose numerous additional risks to our operations  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
we may not be able to complete one or more acquisitions or integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition in the market for electronic interconnect solutions is intense  and could reduce our sales and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability 
the market for electronic interconnect solutions is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we expect competition to persist and intensify  which could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we believe our major competitors are the large united states and international independent captive producers that also manufacture multilayer printed circuit boards and provide backplane and other electronic assemblies  such as honeywell  multek a division of flextronics international ltd  sanmina  tyco international and viasystems 
new and emerging technologies may result in new competitors entering our market 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have a number of significant advantages over us  including significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  greater name recognition  and larger customer bases 
in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  may adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and may devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than us 
we must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers needs for complex products  and our basic interconnect technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
during recessionary periods in the electronics industry  our competitive advantages in the areas of providing an integrated manufacturing solution and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to our customers which may become more price sensitive 
we believe price competition from printed circuit board manufacturers in asia and other locations with lower production costs may play an increasing role in the printed circuit board markets in which we compete 
while historically our competitors in these locations have primarily competed in less technologically advanced markets  they continue to expand their technology to include higher technology printed circuit board 
these competitors may gain market share in the market for higher technology printed circuit boards  which may have a material adverse effect on the pricing of our products and our gross margin and cause our sales to decrease 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws 
we are required to comply with all federal  state  county and municipal regulations regarding protection of the environment 
electronic interconnect product manufacturing requires the use of a variety of materials  including metals and chemicals 
water used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into the municipal sanitary sewer system 
as a result  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the storage  use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing processes 
although we believe our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or operations 
we may be responsible for the cleanup of any contamination discovered at our current and former manufacturing facilities and could be subject to revocation of permits necessary to conduct our business 
further  we can not assure you that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes that expose us to market risk 
we are exposed to fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our outstanding debt 
information required by this item is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note of notes to financial statements
