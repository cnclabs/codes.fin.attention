consequently  the company had experienced substantial operating losses 
the company s financial results improved in culminating with the company achieving profitability in the profitability was driven by sales of synagis  the company s second generation anti rsv drug which was approved by the fda on june  synagis is approved in the us for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by rsv in pediatric patients at high risk for rsv disease 
because of the seasonal nature of rsv  limited sales  if any  are expected during the second and third quarters of any calendar year  causing results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
synagis sales for the rsv season totaled million 
the company obtained marketing authorization by the centralized european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea in august allowing synagis to be marketed in the european union eu 
the company also markets cytogam for the attenuation of primary cmv disease in kidney  lung  liver  pancreas and heart transplant patients and respigam for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by rsv in children under months of age with bpd or a history of prematurity 
respigam  the company s first generation anti rsv drug  has been largely replaced in the marketplace by synagis 
in november  the company completed a merger with us bioscience  inc usb  in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a consequence  historical results of medimmune and usb have been combined

results of operations product sales in millions synagis cytogam ethyol other products total compared to revenues product sales of million in increased over levels of million 
synagis accounted for approximately of the company s product sales 
sales of synagis for the year ended december  increased over contributing to the growth in sales were increases of and in domestic and international sales unit volumes  respectively 
the domestic volume increase resulted from the combination of increasing demand for the product after its introduction into the market as well as twelve months of sales recorded in  versus only four months of sales recorded in  following the launch of the product in september in addition  the selling price of synagis was increased by approximately in may the company has also experienced increased demand for the product internationally following marketing authorization by the emea in august prior to the marketing authorization  product was sold in the eu and other countries on a named patient basis 
abbott international acts as the company s exclusive distributor for synagis sales outside of the us the terms of the company s agreement with abbott provide for the company to receive to percent of end user sales 
the company initially recognizes sales to abbott when synagis is shipped to abbott based on a contractual  guaranteed transfer price  this amount approximates to percent of the total sales revenue expected to be received for each vial 
following the end of each quarter  abbott remits to the company a report detailing end user sales by abbott for the quarter and the company recognizes revenue for the additional amount due in excess of the transfer price and up to to percent of the end user selling price 
as of december   the company and abbott international had filed international registrations in countries for the approval of synagis  of which approvals in countries had been obtained 
there can be no assurance that approvals by the appropriate regulatory authorities will continue to be granted 
additionally  the company may not have received pricing and reimbursement approvals in countries for which regulatory approvals have been obtained 
cytogam accounted for approximately of the company s product sales 
cytogam sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
domestic sales unit volume increased  international unit volume increased and a price increase of was effective march these increases were offset by increased government rebates for the product  principally for medicaid 
in december  the company received fda approval for the use of cytogam in kidney  lung  liver  pancreas and heart transplants  which expanded its labeling from donor positive recipient negative kidney transplant patients 
the increase in domestic units sold reflects both an increase in the core business for cytogam and substitution occurring as a result of the worldwide shortage of standard ivig products 
the increase in international cytogam sales reflects a greater focus on this market as well as the effects of the worldwide shortage of ivig products 
the duration of this shortage and continued impact on cytogam sales cannot be determined at this time 
the increase in government rebates primarily related to the use of cytogam as an ivig substitute 
ethyol accounted for approximately of the company s sales in ethyol revenues increased over levels 
ethyol is sold through distribution partners in the us and internationally  the company receives a percentage of end user sales and records all related cost of goods sold

in june  the company received an expanded indication in the us for use of ethyol in the prevention of severe dry mouth caused by post operative radiation treatment of certain head and neck cancer patients  a similar expanded indication was approved in the eu in the impact on sales of the expanded indication cannot be determined at this time 
additionally  sales made by the company to its distributors may not reflect the ultimate demand for the product by the end users 
sales of other products in decreased from the prior year  reflecting primarily a switch in customer demand from respigam to synagis 
other product sales in were reduced by a million reserve for an estimate of potential returns for respigam sold during the rsv season  as a result of the fda approval of synagis and switch in customer demand 
other product sales in were also negatively affected by transitional factors relating to the company s assumption of full promotional responsibility of two of its products in the united states in mid  following the termination of the co promotion agreement with alza 
alza now receives a commission based on a percentage of net sales of these two products 
the level of future product sales will be dependent on several factors  including  but not limited to  the timing and extent of future regulatory approvals of the company s products and product candidates  availability of finished product inventory  approval and commercialization of competitive products and the degree of acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold rose in to million versus million in this increase is primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes  offset by certain one time adjustments in these one time adjustments to include a charge of million to cost of sales relating to the writedown of respigam inventory  and a credit to cost of sales for the reversal of previously recorded respigam royalties expected to be due to massachusetts health research institute mhri 
excluding these one time adjustments  gross margins increased to in from in  due largely to the increase of synagis sales in proportion to total sales 
synagis has a more favorable margin than the company s other products 
a significant portion of the company s products are primarily manufactured by third parties and future per unit cost of sales could increase if the company is unable to negotiate favorable pricing 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased over the prior year from million in to million in the increase is largely due to costs associated with the continuing synagis clinical trials conducted on infants with congenital heart disease 
also contributing to the increase was million in expenses associated with the clinical studies of lodenosine fdda  which began in late  and were placed on a clinical hold status in october  following serious adverse events 
in  the company also provided research funding to ixsys  a collaborative partner  in an alliance formed in february to develop four monoclonal antibodies primarily in the field of oncology

co promotion expense is recorded ratably as a percentage of net domestic synagis sales 
further increases were attributable to recruiting and staffing expenses incurred in connection with the expansion of the company s sales force in as the company assumed full responsibility for the marketing of neutrexin and hexalen from its former distribution partner 
during the fourth quarter of  the company favorably resolved a prior dispute with one of its partners resulting in receipt of approximately million to the company 
such settlement amount was recorded as a reduction to selling  administrative and general expense in the fourth quarter of other operating expenses other operating expenses  which reflect manufacturing startup costs  decreased in to million from million in expenses in both years include start up costs for the company s frederick manufacturing center fmc 
expenses in include a million charge for the write off of certain equipment purchased for use in the frederick facility  as it was determined that the equipment ultimately will not be used in the facility

the company expects to file an application for this approval sometime in  there can be no assurance that this portion of the facility will receive regulatory approval for its intended purpose

the recognition of these deferred tax assets increased reported earnings per share due to the resulting benefit recorded in the statement of operations from the reduction in the company s valuation allowance 
excluding the reversal of the valuation allowance  the company s income tax expense would have been million in  an effective rate of 
the variation from the statutory rate is principally due to tax credits for research and development expenditures and credits earned for orphan drug status of certain r d expenditures  offset by the nondeductibility of certain merger related expenses 
the company expects that its effective tax rate in future periods will approximate the applicable statutory rates
