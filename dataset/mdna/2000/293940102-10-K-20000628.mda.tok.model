item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this form k 
research and development the company has an ongoing program for development and commercialization of new air pollution control technologies and enhancement of existing technologies 
the company spent approximately   and  on product development during fiscal   and  respectively 
among other important product development activities  the company has developed and acquired patent protection of an advanced technology for the control of sub micron sized particulate emissions from utility and industrial boilers in order to respond to increasingly stringent regulations for fine particulate emissions 
this technology has undergone full scale commercial demonstration during fiscal  and  and is being marketed to commercial customers worldwide 
the company has also developed and introduced into the utility market wide plate spacing precipitators and has developed precipitator dust plates which are shipped and site assembled more easily than earlier generation dust plates 
the company  in fiscal  developed a software based voltage controller with adaptive programming capabilities to enhance precipitator performance 
the company has recently advanced its research and development operations beyond its historical product development activities to funded research programs 
through a cooperative research and development agreement with the us department of energy  the company is working on the enhancement of particulate removal capabilities in certain applications 
under a department of energy sbir grant  the company is augmenting its cds capabilities for mercury and fine particulate control  and under a us department of defense sttr grant  the company is studying glow discharge plasma technology 
the company will continue to develop innovative solutions and or acquire the rights to technologies that help its customers solve specific application problems  and that have significant market potential 
patents the company owns or has the rights to a number of patents  patent applications  and other proprietary technologies which are important to various aspects of its business 
while many individual patents are not considered material to the conduct of the company s business as a whole  the company views its newly acquired patent protection with respect to its fine particulate agglomerator tm technology as potentially providing the company with a significant advantage in the marketing of its precipitators 
it also views the patent protection for its ammonia on demand aod tm technology  for which the company acquired exclusive market rights during fiscal  as potentially providing the company with a significant advantage in the marketing of systems for the control of nitrogen oxide emissions 
generally  however  the company believes that its ability to compete in the air pollution control industry depends primarily on its engineering and technological expertise  rather than on patent protection 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing efforts are organized to provide emphasis and focus by both market and product area 
primary market areas include the power industry  the industrial market  and aftermarket products and services 
the company has integrated its maintenance and field service resources with a regional sales network  linked to its regional service centers  allowing it to build long term customer relationships and provide solutions to customers needs in a highly responsive manner 
the sales efforts are technical in nature and involve its sales and marketing professionals  supported by the company s senior technical and management professionals  who provide product based expertise to all regional and market areas 
a significant portion of the company s sales are made through architectural and engineering firms  which play an important role in the preparation of specifications for air pollution control systems 
the company s sales and marketing group consists of industry and regional sales managers and sales representatives 
although the company seeks to obtain repeat business from its customers  it does not depend on any single customer to maintain its level of activity from year to year 
one customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in fiscal  three customers accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal  and no customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in fiscal at fiscal year end  approximately of the company s accounts and retainages receivable were due from companies within the power industry and approximately were due from companies within the pulp and paper industry 
all of the company s overseas foreign sales are generated through royalties from international licensees or from export sales  which were of sales in fiscal  and less than of consolidated sales in fiscal years and in order to take advantage of certain overseas market opportunities  the company has established licensing agreements with companies in the people s republic of china  india  russia  south korea  finland  and brazil under which the company is entitled to royalties based upon sales in the licensed territory 
these agreements do not currently represent a material source of income 
in addition to the licenses  the company has established  with its chinese licensee  a joint venture in china  which commenced production  in fiscal  of certain precipitator components for use by the company and its licensee 
with its indian licensee  during fiscal  the company trained certain of the licensee s engineers to perform engineering activities for global applications  including both international projects and projects delivered in north america 
suppliers and subcontractors like other companies in its industry  the company relies on outside suppliers  manufacturers and fabricators to supply parts and components in accordance with the company s specifications 
in addition  in cases in which the company s scope of work includes installation of equipment  the company selects and supervises subcontractors for this work 
to date  the company has not experienced difficulties either in obtaining fabricated components incorporated in its systems or in obtaining qualified subcontractors 
it has been the company s recent experience  however  that in times of recession or other industry downturns  the company is more likely to be faced with subcontractor performance problems and construction claims asserted by certain of its subcontractors 
in response  the company is required to more aggressively manage its construction activities and contracts  and  in some cases  can be subject to unanticipated costs 
the company s vendor sources for various components  materials and parts used in its systems  including certain electrodes  collecting plates  control switches  electrical components  and other components  include a substantial number of firms 
the company does not depend on any one of these vendors to a material extent  and in any event the company believes that alternative vendors would be available if needed 
with respect to fabricators  the company has satisfactory relationships with fabricators throughout the united states and canada 
similarly  with respect to installation subcontractors  the company has satisfactory relations with firms throughout the united states and canada 
based on the number of vendors  fabricators  and subcontractors and the availability of alternative sources  the company does not believe that the loss of its relationship with any one firm would have a material adverse effect on its business 
competition the company faces substantial competition in each of its principal markets 
some of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than the company 
the company competes primarily on the basis of its engineering and technological expertise and quality of equipment and service provided 
the company believes that the cost of entry into most of its markets  its experience and reputation for reliability and service  and its knowledge of the plants and operations of its customers are principal factors that enhance its ability to provide high quality services and to compete effectively for repair and rebuild contracts as well as new installations 
additionally  the company believes that the successful performance of its installed systems is a key factor in dealing with its customers  which typically prefer to make significant purchases from a company with a solid performance history 
virtually all contracts for the company s systems and technologies are obtained through competitive bidding 
customers typically purchase these systems and technologies after a thorough evaluation of price  technical content  service  experience  and quality 
although price is an important factor and may in some cases be the governing factor  it is not always determinative  and contracts are often awarded on the basis of life cycle costs and or product reliability 
regulation significant environmental laws have been enacted in response to public concern about the environment 
these laws and the implementing regulations affect nearly every industrial activity 
the need to comply with these laws creates demand for the company s services 
the principal federal legislation that has created a substantial and growing demand for the company s systems and technologies  and therefore has the most significant effect on the company s business  is the clean air act of  as amended the clean air act 
this legislation requires compliance with ambient air quality standards and empowers the environmental protection agency epa to establish and enforce limits on the emission of various pollutants from specific types of facilities 
the states have primary responsibility for implementing these standards and  in some cases  have adopted standards more stringent than those established by the epa 
in  amendments to the clean air act were adopted which address  among other things  the country s acid rain problem by imposing strict controls on the emissions of sulfur oxides caused by the combustion of coal and other solid fuels 
the power generation market is the first to face the compliance standards set by the amendments 
under the legislation  coal burning power plants are required to comply with new emissions standards in two phases 
the first phase  beginning with enactment of the amendments and generally ending in or  required reduced emissions levels leading to full compliance  with limited exceptions  by the end of the second phase in the year during  the epa approved regulations that are expected to significantly increase the number of companies subject to regulation for ozone related emissions  and for emissions of particles at a much smaller size than previously regulated 
during  the epa issued regulations requiring utilities in states to significantly reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox by the year  in order to control smog creation 
both sets of regulations are currently in litigation  therefore the specific outcomes required by the regulations  and the timetables for compliance  are uncertain 
in its operations  the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning environmental  safety  occupational and health standards 
expenditures required in fiscal by such laws were not material to the company s business and the company is not at a competitive disadvantage by reason of compliance with such laws 
bonding and insurance the company is from time to time required to provide bonds guaranteeing that it will enter into contracts as bid  guaranteeing performance of its contract obligations  and or guaranteeing prompt payment of its suppliers and subcontractors 
the company s current surety commitment is  in management s opinion  sufficient to support the company s current levels of bonded business 
in addition  the company has a bank revolving credit and letter of credit agreement which provides for issuance of letters of credit for various purposes  including as substitutes for performance or payment bonds 
the company currently maintains different types of insurance  including comprehensive liability and property coverage 
the company does not carry a separate errors and omissions policy  but limited errors and omissions coverage is provided under its comprehensive liability policy 
while a successful claim in an amount in excess of the company s insurance coverage  or for which there is no coverage  including claims arising out of the provision by the company of engineering services without a product could have a material adverse effect on the company  the company believes that it presently maintains adequate insurance coverage for its business 
to the extent that the company performs or will perform engineering only services for customers  the company will  to the extent practicable  obtain the benefit of contractual terms which limit or eliminate the exposure which would otherwise be insured by an errors and omissions policy 
employees as of march   the company had full time employees  of whom more than were engineers and other professionals and technical employees 
the company also hires contract and other temporary personnel to meet the requirements of particular contracts  as well as contract personnel to carry out construction supervisory functions 
the company s professional staff includes chemical engineers  electrical engineers  mechanical engineers  civil engineers  and computer scientists 
although the company depends on professional employees for performance of its services  it has not experienced any difficulty in employing such personnel to satisfy its requirements 
none of the company s employees is represented by a union 
the company considers its relations with its employees to be good 
prior to the end of fiscal  the company announced a restructuring plan to shift the focus of its operations to a leaner services and technology driven business model 
the plan is being implemented during the early months of fiscal and will reduce the company s employment level to approximately employees 
item properties substantially all of the company s operations  including administration  engineering  design  and sales operations are conducted from its baltimore headquarters  located in a modern office building with approximately  square feet of leased space 
the company occupies approximately  square feet of this space and subleases substantially all of the remaining space
