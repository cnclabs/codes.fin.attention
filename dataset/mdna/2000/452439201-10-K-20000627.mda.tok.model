impact of year the company has been aware of the complexity and significance of the year issue 
during the past year  the company acted to minimize the risk of disruption from a year related problem 
the company established a year compliance program which was comprised of five phases discovery  planning  resolution  testing and implementation 
the scope of the company s compliance program included information technology systems computer hardware and software and non information technology systems facilities  telecommunication systems  distribution center machinery  security systems and video and sound processing equipment which may include embedded technology

non recurring uses during the fiscal years ended march  and were attributable to the development of the company s las vegas  nevada warehouse and distribution facility 
working capital has historically been provided by cash flows from operations  private and public sales of common stock  notes representing short and long term debt and bank borrowings 
sources and uses of working capital  fiscal and net cash used in operating activities for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal the increase is primarily due to a dramatic increase in royalty and distribution fee advances paid during fiscal to secure future exclusive rights for both domestic and international distribution and when available  worldwide broadcast  vhs distribution and digital downloading and streaming rights

additionally  the company continues to slowly sell its laserdisc inventory at deep discounts to the few retail customers remaining 
lastly  the increase in cash used by operating activities was also due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets at march   primarily due to a receivable for litigation proceeds received in may  minority interest in the company s joint venture and deferred advertising payments made for certain of the company s exclusive programming

management believes that its projected cash flows from operations  borrowing availability under its revolving lines of credit  cash on hand and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet its projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if cash flows to be generated from operations  future borrowing availability under its lender revolving lines of credit and future cash on hand are insufficient to satisfy the company s continuing licensing and acquisition of exclusive dvd programming which require significant advance royalty or distribution fee payments  the company will need to seek additional debt and or equity financing 
failure to obtain this additional financing could significantly restrict the company s growth plans 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in interest rates and  in the future  changes in foreign currency exchange rates have and will have an impact on the company s results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations

this exposure is linked to the prime rate and libor 
the company believes that moderate changes in the prime rate or libor would not materially affect the operating results or financial condition of the company 
for example  a change in interest rates would result in an approximate  annual impact on pretax income loss based upon those outstanding borrowings at march  subject to interest rate fluctuations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk associated with its accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
the company has begun to distribute certain of its licensed dvd and vhs programming for which the company has international distribution rights internationally through international sub distributors 
the company s first international video release occurred in march the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk through march  has not been material 
to date  the company has not entered into foreign currency exchange contracts 
the company is exploring ways to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
