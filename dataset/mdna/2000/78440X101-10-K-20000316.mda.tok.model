liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the operating cash flow generated by the same store properties  acquisitions and acquisitions as a result of higher occupancy rates  rents which have been marked to market and flat property operating expense trends and an increase in investment income 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the decreased amount of property acquisitions in million as compared to the amount of property acquisitions in million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million provided by financing activities for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to net proceeds from the company s public offerings of common stock million and preferred stock million which were used to pay off the company s acquisition facility million and purchase certain acquisitions as well as an increase in the dividends and distributions paid million 
capitalization during  the company financed its acquisitions primarily with property level debt 
this debt totaled million with interest rates ranging from percent to percent at december  at december   borrowings under the mortgage loans  and credit facilities represented of the company s market capitalization based on a total market capitalization debt and equity including preferred stock  assuming conversion of all operating partnership units  of billion based on a common stock price of per share  the closing price of the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange on december  
the company s principal debt maturities are scheduled to be million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
at december   the company had million of property level mortgage debt weighted average interest rate of percent  encumbering properties 
this was comprised of million in fixed rate debt and million in floating rate debt 
at december   the company had availability of million under its million credit facility weighted average interest rate of percent 
on december   the company closed on a million credit facility with pscc 
the current borrowing capacity is million  of which none was drawn down at december  the pscc facility is secured by the company s preferred equity interest in avenue of the americas and a repurchase mortgage participation interest in the mortgage at lexington avenue 
interest only is payable based on the month libor plus basis points 
the pscc facility may be prepaid at any time during its term without penalty 
the pscc facility matures on december  the company is currently evaluating its options with respect to million of debt maturing in the company may refinance such debt or obtain new loans 
the company expects to make distributions to its stockholders primarily based on its distributions received from the operating partnership primarily from property revenues or  if necessary  from working capital or borrowings 
the company estimates that for the years ending december  and  it will incur approximately million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures including tenant improvements on properties currently owned 
in and  million and million  respectively  of the capital investments will be associated with the redevelopment of properties acquired at or after the company s ipo 
the company expects to fund these capital expenditures with the credit facilities  operating cash flow and cash on hand 
future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments in such properties for refurbishment and leasing costs 
the company expects that these financing requirements will be provided primarily from the credit facilities  from additional borrowings secured by the properties and from future issuances of equity and debt 
the company believes that it will have sufficient capital resources to satisfy its obligations during the next month period 
thereafter  the company expects that capital needs will be met through net cash provided by operations or additional borrowings 
to maintain its qualification as a reit  the company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least percent of its reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 
moreover  the company intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to its stockholders which  based upon current policy  in the aggregate would equal approximately million on an annualized basis 
however  any such distribution  whether for federal income tax purposes or otherwise  would only be paid out of available cash after meeting both operating requirements and scheduled debt service on mortgages and loans payable 
funds from operations the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit in march defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties and significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of the company s performance over time  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in october  nareit revised the definition of ffo to include non recurring events 
this revised definition is effective for all periods beginning on or after january  the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the current standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the offering  funds from operations for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and  on a historical basis  are as follows in thousands year ended december historical historical pro forma income before minority interest and extraordinary item    add depreciation and amortization    loss on hedge transaction loss on terminated transaction  ffo adjustment for unconsolidated joint ventures less dividends on preferred shares   minority interest in the bmw building  amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets   funds from operations    cash flows provided by operating activities   cash flows used in investing activities   cash flows provided by financing activities   in compliance with the white paper issued by nareit in march  the company has excluded a loss from a hedge transaction  and loss on terminated transaction million from the calculation of ffo 
the company believes these transactions are non recurring in nature based on the company s operating history of not entering into these types of transactions and  therefore  are non recurring and would materially distort the company s performance if included in the calculation of ffo 
in accordance with the revised white paper issued by nareit in october  these transactions would be included in the calculation of ffo 
inflation substantially all of the office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations 
the company believes that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was scheduled to be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance 
in  the fasb delayed implementation of fasb by one year 
the company expects to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
year compliance the company identified three areas of focus for year compliance internal information technology  property operating equipment  and third party service suppliers 
the company began a project to update its information technology resources by installing new hardware and software throughout the company and completed the implementation of the systems during the company inquired regarding compliance status from all vendors providing systems identified as having potential year compliance problems 
the company then tested each system with these vendors 
at present  the company has no automated interfaces from third party service providers into the company s financial systems 
in addition  limited contingency procedures were drafted in the event of year failures associated with critical property level systems on the company s internal information technology 
the company did not incur material direct costs related to year these direct costs excluded the costs to replace the hardware and software systems  as the decision to replace these systems was not accelerated by year issues 
due to the company s year program  the company experienced no operational problems relating to the year issue 
the company has concluded the year project and anticipates no further year compliance issues or expenditures 
item a market risk and risk management policies the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its floating rate debt arrangements 
the company currently does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve would adversely affect the company s annual interest cost by approximately million annually 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate collars in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply deferral accounting 
gains and losses related to the termination of such derivative financial instruments are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt instrument 
the company may also utilize interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk on anticipated debt offerings 
these anticipatory hedges are designated  as effective hedges for identified debt issuances which have a high probability of occurring 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the market value of these contracts are deferred and amortized into interest expense over the life of the related debt instrument 
the cost of hedges determined to be ineffective and hedges not correlated to financings are charged to operations 
approximately million of the company s long term debt bears interest at fixed rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates 
the following table presents principal cash flows in thousands based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed rate debt 
the interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december  ranged from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
long term debt  including current portion in fair thousands thereafter total value fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate
