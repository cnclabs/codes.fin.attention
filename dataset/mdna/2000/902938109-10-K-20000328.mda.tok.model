item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the company has not entered into  and does not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
the company is currently exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations since the majority of the company s long term debt obligations are at variable rates 
the company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swap and or similar instruments 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments trade accounts receivable and payables and accrued expenses the fair value of these receivables and payables equal their carrying value because of their short maturities 
revolving credit line and terms loans interest rates that are currently available to the company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value for debt issues for which no market quotes are available 
the carrying amount of these debt facilities is believed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value

interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on a significant portion of its outstanding indebtedness 
certain outstanding balances under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over prime

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact the company s earnings or cash flows
