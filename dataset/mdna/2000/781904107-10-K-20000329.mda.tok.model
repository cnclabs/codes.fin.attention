item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we have materially expanded our business over the last three years through acquisitions 
the acquisitions of unity cellular and atlantic cellular in and  respectively  approximately doubled our number of customers at the time of each transaction  on a pro forma basis 
all acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  therefore  our historical results of operations include the results of operations for each acquired system subsequent to its respective acquisition date 
we anticipate closing the triton acquisition in the spring of and again approximately doubling our number of customers 
over the past three years  our financial performance  and the year to year comparability of such performance  has been affected by the acquisitions described below  the development of wireless alliance  and the issuance of our senior subordinated notes and senior exchangeable preferred stock to fund our growth 
accordingly  we do not believe the discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations set forth below are indicative nor should they be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
acquisition and joint venture history we follow a disciplined strategy of acquiring and developing wireless systems  primarily in rural markets 
through december   we have entered into a joint venture to develop and offer personal communications services  or pcs  and have completed four acquisitions of cellular systems as described below in november  we formed a joint venture named wireless alliance with an affiliate of aerial communications 
we originally owned of wireless alliance  as of june  we increased our ownership to  with an affiliate of aerial communications owning the remaining 
effective may  we acquired the maine wireless operations and assets of unity cellular systems  inc and related cellular and microwave licenses from intercel  inc for approximately million 
effective july  we acquired the massachusetts  new hampshire  new york  vermont and cellular licenses  operations  and related assets of atlantic cellular company lp and one of its subsidiaries for approximately million 
effective august  we acquired the outstanding stock of western maine cellular  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of utilities  inc  for approximately million 
effective february  we acquired the outstanding stock of rgi group  inc  d b a glacial lakes cellular  for approximately million 
pending acquisition in november  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the cellular licenses  operations  and related assets of triton cellular partners  lp and its affiliates for a purchase price of approximately billion in cash  plus the assumption of specified liabilities 
under the agreement with triton  we will acquire licenses to operate wireless systems in rural markets in the northwest and south regions of the united states  with a total service area of approximately  square miles  and  as of december   covering a total population  or pops  of million and serving  customers 
general rural cellular s principal operating objective is to increase revenues and profitability through the acquisition and development of new markets and increased penetration in existing markets 
we believe that owning and operating wireless systems in rural markets provides growth opportunities because these systems have lower penetration rates  a higher proportion of roamer revenues  and less competition for customers than wireless systems located in larger metropolitan areas 
we have a strategy of acquiring wireless systems primarily in rural markets and focus on acquiring underdeveloped wireless systems that include a high concentration of highway corridors and  as a result  tend to have a significant amount of roamer activity 
we will continue to pursue acquisitions to the extent they enhance or extend our network 
we operate our wireless systems using a decentralized management approach that allows us to achieve marketing and distribution benefits  as well as operating efficiencies 
we develop a local presence in the communities we serve  which enhances our competitive position and allows us to tailor our products and services to meet our customers specific needs 
we believe that our ability to customize our products and services results in greater customer satisfaction  customer retention and market penetration 
we also believe that we will be able to continue to maintain high retention rates due in part to our territory manager distribution philosophy  by offering communication service packages and value added features anticipating customer needs  and by providing high quality and knowledgeable customer service 
we have continued to penetrate our existing midwest  atlantic  and maine regions through our sales initiatives  resulting in increased revenues in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  and we intend to roll out our marketing strategies throughout our existing systems and newly acquired systems  including systems acquired in the triton acquisition 
as a result of these strategies  we have been able to generate strong internal growth and improve the operating and financial performance of our systems 
our revenues primarily consist of service  roamer and equipment revenues  each of which is described below service revenues include monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of the time included in the service package purchased  long distance charges derived from calls placed by our customers as well as cellular and paging equipment lease revenues 
total service revenues are affected by the number of customers  pricing  and number of minutes used 
additional charges include activation fees and charges for such features as voicemail  call waiting  and call forwarding 
roamer revenues consist of airtime  long distance  and service fees charged for providing service to customers of other cellular systems that place or receive a call within our cellular service area and our customers that place or receive a call outside of our cellular service area 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer  or the intercarrier exchange rate  is determined by an agreement between rural cellular and the roamer s cellular carrier 
we have agreements with cellular licensees in other cellular service areas that allow us to provide service to our customers calling from or receiving calls in these territories at favorable rates 
equipment revenues include sales of cellular and paging equipment  accessory sales to customers  and network equipment reselling 
within certain markets  we rent equipment to customers as an alternative to selling such cellular equipment 
this program has reduced equipment revenues as a percentage of total revenues in these markets  however  we believe our equipment rental policy enhances customer retention and market penetration  reduces acquisition costs  and increases revenue per customer 
our operating expenses include network costs  cost of equipment sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization  each of which is described below network costs include switching and transport expenses and the expenses associated with the maintenance and operation of our wireless network facilities  as well as charges from other service providers for resold minutes and services 
cost of equipment sales includes the costs associated with telephone equipment and accessories sold to customers 
in recent years  we and other cellular providers have increased the use of discounts on phone equipment as competition between service providers has intensified 
as a result  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  losses on equipment sales and increased marketing and selling costs per gross additional customer 
we expect to continue these discounts and promotions because we believe that they will result in increased revenues from increases in the number of our cellular customers 
selling  general and administrative includes salaries  benefits  and operating expenses such as marketing  commissions  customer support  accounting  administration  and billing 
depreciation and amortization represents the costs associated with the depreciation of our fixed assets and the amortization of our intangible assets  primarily cellular license acquisition costs  goodwill and customer lists 
the high level of depreciation and amortization is associated with our acquisition activities and the build out and upgrade of our network 
in addition to the operating expenses discussed above  we also incur other income expense  primarily interest expense related to our financing and acquisition activities 
interest expense results from our borrowings under our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes  the proceeds of which were used to finance our acquisitions and develop our systems 
other income expense includes our minority partner s absorption of wireless alliance losses as accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles 
we have realized the maximum benefit from the allocation of losses to our minority partner as of december  and will receive no further benefit until wireless alliance generates income 
preferred stock dividends are related to our issuance in may of  shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock in conjunction with our acquisition of atlantic cellular 
dividends on the senior exchangeable preferred stock are cumulative  payable quarterly  and may be paid  at our option  on any dividend payment date occurring on or before may   either in cash or by the issuance of additional shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock having a total liquidation preference equal to the amount of such dividends 
wireless alliance is our joint venture with an affiliate of aerial communications 
our accounting policies and practices for wireless alliance are the same as those we use in our other regions 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for the minority ownership and eliminate all inter company transactions on consolidation 
any allocable wireless alliance losses are first applied to reduce the carrying value of the minority interest in the joint venture and  thereafter  consolidated with rural cellular s operating results 
as of december   the minority ownership interest had been fully used to offset wireless alliance s losses 
results of operations the following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues as well as other operating data for the periods indicated

ebitda is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative for other performance measures and should not be considered in isolation 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and does not reflect all expenses of doing business eg  interest expense  depreciation 
accordingly  ebitda should not be considered as having greater significance than or as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
years ended december  and revenues service revenues 
service revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the revenue growth reflects the effect of  additional net customers added through increased penetration in existing markets and  additional customers added through the acquisition of glacial lakes cellular

during the year ended december   wireless alliance generated million in service revenues 
roamer revenues 
roamer revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in roamer revenues have increased due to the activation of additional cell sites  acquisitions of new service areas  and increased industry wide wireless usage resulting from the now popular single rate calling plans 
partially offsetting the effect of increases in roaming minutes of use during the year ended december  was the impact of lower roaming rates with two major roaming partners 
wireless alliance generated  in pcs roamer revenue during the year ended december  equipment revenues 
equipment revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the prior year

as a percentage of total revenues  network costs for the year ended december  decreased to from in the prior year 
the increase in network costs resulted primarily from expenses incurred in our atlantic region  which more than offset wireless alliance network cost reductions 
we expect consolidated network costs to continue to decline as a percentage of revenues as revenues continue to outpace the fixed components of network costs 
cost of equipment sales 
cost of equipment sales for the year ended december  increased over the prior year to million from million 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of equipment sales for the year ended december  increased to as compared to in the prior year 
this growth was primarily due to the cost of resold network equipment combined with an increase in the number of phones sold to customers 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased over the prior year to million from million 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects rcc s ownership of the atlantic operations for a full year during as compared to six months in reflecting certain economies achieved through the acquisition of the atlantic operations and the relatively fixed nature of selling  general and administrative expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december  to as compared to in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased over the prior year to million from million 
the increase reflects the depreciable assets acquired as part of the atlantic cellular acquisition  our continued construction and acquisition efforts  and our investments in network facilities  including our launch of pcs services through wireless alliance  and rental equipment 
other income expense interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase resulted from higher average borrowings under the existing credit facility and interest related to the senior subordinated notes

preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase primarily resulted from the senior exchangeable preferred stock having been outstanding for a full year in  versus less than eight months in the preferred stock dividends were paid by issuing additional shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock 
ebitda ebitda increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in for the year ended december   our cellular operations generated million in ebitda  which was partially offset by wireless alliance s negative ebitda of million 
years ended december  and revenues service revenues 
service revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in this growth was primarily due to a increase in customers from existing markets and a increase in customers through the acquisition of atlantic cellular 
during the year ended december   wireless alliance generated service revenues of million 
roamer revenues 
roamer revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in roamer revenues have increased due to the activation of additional cell sites and acquisitions of new service areas 
wireless alliance generated an immaterial amount in roamer revenues during and had no roamer revenues in because it was exclusively engaged in reselling cellular services 
equipment revenues 
equipment revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in this growth was primarily due to an increase in the number of customers  as a result of our acquisition of atlantic cellular  who purchase their phones as opposed to the number of customers who participate in the equipment rental program currently popular in our midwest region 
key revenue indicators 
our cellular penetration as of december  increased to from as of december  reflecting its market launch  wireless alliance pcs penetration reached for cellular average monthly revenue per customer for the year ended december  decreased to as compared to in wireless alliance pcs average revenue per customer was in operating expenses network costs 
network costs for the year ended december   increased to million from million in the increase in network costs resulted primarily from expenses incurred by wireless alliance and our maine and atlantic regions  which more than offset network cost reductions in our midwest operations 
however  as a percentage of total revenues  network costs decreased to in from in contributing to the reduction of network costs in the midwest service area was the completed installation of our switch in the third quarter of  thereby reducing our network costs for switching services 
network costs for wireless alliance increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase is attributable to additional network costs associated with an increase in the average number of cellular reselling customers 
cost of equipment sales 
cost of equipment sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  cost of equipment sales for the year ended december  increased to as compared to in the prior year

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase reflects our continued construction and acquisition efforts and our investments in network facilities and rental equipment 
specifically contributing to the increase was the depreciation relating to the construction of additional cell sites in our midwest region  an additional cell sites from the acquisition of atlantic cellular  and the activation of wireless alliance pcs cell sites 
in addition  license and other intangible asset amortization resulting from acquisitions increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
other income expense interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase in interest expense resulted from higher average borrowings under our credit facilities and interest related to the senior subordinated notes used to finance the acquisitions of atlantic cellular and western maine cellular  the construction of cell sites  and other growth initiatives 
other income 
other income includes an increase in the year ended december  in the minority partner s absorption of wireless alliance losses 
extraordinary item in may  we repaid approximately million of the outstanding principal amount under our million credit facility utilizing the proceeds from our issuance of million in subordinated notes and  shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock 
accordingly  we recognized an extraordinary loss of approximately million related to the early retirement of debt representing the unamortized debt issuance costs 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends of million were paid in the year ended december  the preferred stock dividends were incurred as a result of our issuance of  shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock in may the preferred stock dividends were paid by issuing additional shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock 
ebitda ebitda for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million in in  our cellular operations generated million in ebitda  which was partially offset by wireless alliance s negative ebitda of million due to the significant costs associated with customer growth 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions  and customer growth 
in the past we have met these requirements through cash flow from operations  sales of our common and preferred stock  borrowings under our credit facility  and issuance of our senior subordinated notes 
our existing credit facility provides for borrowings up to million 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
under the existing credit facility  amounts may be borrowed  subject to mandatory repayments  or repaid at any time through maturity  provided that the outstanding borrowings do not exceed the total amount available under the existing credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  adjustments to the million net income to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities included million in depreciation and amortization  a million increase in accounts receivable and other adjustments 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
the principal uses of cash included our million acquisition of glacial lakes cellular  million for the pending acquisition of triton and million in purchases of property and equipment  of which million was attributable to wireless alliance capital expenditures 
these purchases reflect the continued expansion of our existing cellular coverage and the continued upgrading of existing cell sites and switching equipment 
in addition  one of our affiliates was a successful bidder in the auction of local multi point distribution system licenses  acquiring licenses at a cost of million  and was a successful bidder in the pcs c block license auction  acquiring the license for the st 
cloud  minnesota basic trading area for million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   consisting primarily of million in additional borrowings under the million credit facility  net of a partial repayment of million 
in february  we completed a follow on offering of  shares of class a common stock 
these shares were sold to the public at per share 
we also completed the offering of  shares of junior exchangeable preferred stock and  shares of our senior exchangeable preferred stock 
the junior exchangeable preferred stock and senior exchangeable preferred stock were sold at a price of  and per share  respectively  have a liquidation preference of  per share and are not convertible into common stock 
the million net proceeds from the offerings will be used  together with a new billion credit facility and the issuance of million in convertible preferred stock  to finance the pending acquisition of the licenses  operations and related assets of triton  repay our existing credit facility balance of million at december   fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that after the triton acquisition we will have million available under the new credit facility 
in the event that the triton acquisition does not close  we will not enter into the new credit facility and will be required to redeem the junior exchangeable preferred stock 
in that event  the funds available under our existing credit facility and proceeds from the common and senior exchangeable preferred stock offerings will be adequate to fund anticipated capital expenditures and operations 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million including million for wireless alliance and million for triton 
other matters inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant 
year readiness prior to january   our yk project team  staffed with subject matter experts  evaluated our computerized systems to ensure that our business and operational systems would be yk ready 
as a result  we believe all of our mission critical software and hardware were remedied and made yk ready 
we budgeted million to cover costs associated with yk assessments  modifications  and associated upgrades  of which approximately million had been spent on upgrades and replacements of non yk compliant systems as of december  our cellular network has continued to function in without service affecting outages due to yk problems 
however  some network equipment suppliers were and or continue to be unwilling or unable to give unqualified warranties that network equipment is yk compliant 
the terms and conditions under which we provide cellular and paging services to our customers provide that we are not liable for any consequential or incidental damages to our customers 
service affecting outages have occurred in limited geographic areas in the past and we have not been found liable to any person for damages in excess of the limitations imposed by the terms and conditions of service 
we believe it is unlikely that an outage related to yk readiness would lead to a different result  but we cannot assure you that our liability will be limited to that extent 
as we have not experienced any outages related to yk  we do not anticipate that any litigation involving us would arise as a result of yk readiness issues 
as the year progresses  we may experience problems associated with the year that have not yet been discovered 
we continue to monitor and test our systems to identify and correct any problems 
our yk project team will remain in place at least through the first quarter of seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income loss 
our average monthly roamer revenue per cellular customer increases during the second and third calendar quarters 
this increase reflects greater usage by our roamer customers who travel in our cellular service area for weekend and vacation recreation or work in seasonal industries 
because our cellular service area includes many seasonal recreational areas  we expect that roamer revenues will continue to fluctuate seasonally more than service revenues 
with the triton acquisition we will cover a more diverse geographic area  and we anticipate that this diversification will reduce the effects of seasonality on our operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk rural cellular corporation uses exchangeable preferred stock  senior subordinated notes  and bank credit facilities to finance its operations 
these on balance sheet financial instruments  to the extent they provide for variable rates of interest  expose us to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate risk exposure resulting from changes in libor or the prime rate  which are used to determine the interest rates that are applicable to borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
we use off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap and interest rate protection agreements  to partially hedge interest transactions 
all of our derivative financial instrument transactions are entered into for non trading purposes 
the terms and characteristics of the derivative financial instruments are matched with the underlying on balance sheet instrument or anticipated transaction and do not constitute speculative or leveraged positions independent of these exposures 
at december   million of our debt bore interest at a variable rate  of which million is rate protected by three interest rate swaps 
holding other variables constant  such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be expected to have an estimated impact on pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately  in a given year 
had the company not entered into the million in interest rate swaps  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be expected to have an additional million impact on pretax earnings and cash flows in a given year
