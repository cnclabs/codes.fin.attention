item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results operations results of operations note all dollar amounts are in thousands vs 
net sales   increase decrease  our sales growth was primarily in the domestic market 
sales for our core product lines  stackers and bottomwrappers  continue to be strong 
the sales growth included increased sales of original equipment manufacturers oem equipment 
we sell oem products to compliment our product line and provide our customers a single source solution for integrated post press material handling systems 
gross profit   increase decrease  percentage of net sales the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the sale of a higher percentage of oem equipment  which generally has lower margins than products we manufacture 
selling  general and administrative expense   increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was principally due to higher sales and marketing costs  offset in part by a decrease in professional fees 
the higher sales and marketing costs were due in part to increased sales 
additionally  we increased spending on trade shows and advertising in trade journals in order to introduce our two new products  the automatic palletizer system and the quipp gripp ii gripper conveyer 
we also hired a salesperson and sales support staff to improve our sales efforts in international markets 
the decrease in professional fees reflects reduced spending for legal and accounting fees 
in  the company incurred professional fees in connection with an aborted business combination transaction and patent infringement litigation that we brought against another company 
the litigation was settled in research and development increase decrease percentage of net sales research and development costs in and were incurred primarily to develop two new products  the palletizer and the quipp gripp ii

the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in other income and expense net was due to the decrease in interest income 
this decrease reflected lower cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale due the payment of a  special dividend in may results of operations note all dollar amounts are in thousands vs 
net sales   increase decrease in we experienced record sales of our core products  stackers and bottomwrappers 
gross profit   increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in gross profit was principally the result of an improved sales mix and continued manufacturing cost control programs 
our core products have a higher gross profit margin than ancillary products such as conveyors  floor equipment or oem equipment 
the improved gross profit margin was partially offset by a reclassification of bad debt allowances of  to product cost contingencies contract reserves 
cost contingencies are anticipated future additional costs that may be incurred after equipment is shipped and installed  the customer has been invoiced and revenue is recorded 
we record cost contingencies to match possible future expenses with related revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses   increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was principally due to legal and accounting fees incurred in connection with an aborted business combination and patent infringement litigation that we brought against another company  which was settled during the increase was offset in part by a reclassification of bad debt expense to product cost contingencies  which is included in cost of goods sold 
research and development increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in research and development expenditures from to principally related to development of an improved gripper conveyor and the development of a palletizer 
operating income   increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in the operating income  as compared to  was principally a result of increases in research and development and selling  general and administrative costs  offset by the increase in gross profit 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income remained relatively stable 
other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in other income and expense net was a result of increases in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
general the majority of our sales are made on a contract basis 
typically  we receive a deposit upon the execution of the sales contract 
prior to shipment  we receive additional installment payments 
we normally receive larger orders several months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of our short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  and the receipt and nature of new orders 
our backlog  as of december  and december   was  and  respectively 
the backlog includes some oem products  which generally have lower margins than products we manufacture 
management believes all orders in the december  backlog will be satisfied by the end of liquidity and capital resources on december   cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled  as compared to  at december   a decrease of  this decrease was primarily due to the payment of a  special cash dividend to shareholders on may  the decrease was partially offset by cash provided by operations and  received upon the exercise of stock options 
working capital at december  was  a decrease of  from  at december  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current level 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k  including statements concerning shipment of backlog orders  shipment of automatic palletizing systems and quipp gripp ii  the possible expansion of our facilities and adequacy of available resources  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements including  but not limited to  economic conditions generally and specifically in the newspaper industry  demand and market acceptance for new and existing products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  manufacturing capacity  delays in shipment  cancellation of customer orders  and engineering and production difficulties
