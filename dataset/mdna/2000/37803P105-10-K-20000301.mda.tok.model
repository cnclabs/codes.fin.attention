forward looking statements  factors that may affect operating results this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities and exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions  beliefs and strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding potential acquisitions  the anticipated performance of future acquisitions  recently completed acquisitions and existing properties  and statements regarding the company s financing activities 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth below 
the limited availability of and competition for real estate acquisitions may restrict the company s ability to grow the company s growth depends  in part  upon acquisitions 
the company cannot be sure that properties will be available for acquisition or  if available  that it will be able to purchase those properties on favorable terms 
the unavailability of such acquisitions could limit the company s growth 
furthermore  the company faces competition from several other businesses  individuals  fiduciary accounts and plans and entities in the acquisition  operation and sale of properties 
some of the company s competitors are larger than it is and have greater financial resources than it does 
this competition could cause the cost of properties it wishes to purchase to rise 
if the company is unable to continue to grow through acquisitions  then its results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
competition for tenants could adversely affect the company s operations when space becomes available at the company s properties  the leases may not be renewed  the space may not be leased or re leased  or the terms of the renewal or re lease including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to it than the prior lease 
the company has established annual property budgets that include estimates of costs for renovation and re leasing expenses 
the company believes that these estimates are reasonable in light of each property s situation  however  no assurance can be given that these estimates will sufficiently cover these expenses 
if the company cannot lease all or substantially all of the space at its properties promptly  if the rental rates are significantly lower than expected  or if the company s reserves for these purposes prove inadequate  then the company s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
tenants defaults could adversely affect the company s operations the company s ability to manage its assets is subject to federal bankruptcy laws and state laws that limit creditors rights and remedies available to real property owners to collect delinquent rents 
if a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt  the company cannot be sure that it could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor in possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to that tenant 
the company also cannot be sure that it would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover its expenses with respect to the premises 
if a tenant becomes bankrupt  the federal bankruptcy code will apply  which in some instances may restrict the amount and recoverability of the company s claims against the tenant 
a tenant s default on its obligations to the company could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
cash flow may be insufficient for debt service requirements the company intends to incur indebtedness in the future  including through borrowings under its credit facility  to finance property acquisitions  retirement of debt and stock repurchases 
as a result  the company expects to be subject to the following risks associated with debt financing including that interest rates may increase  that the company s cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments on its debt  and that the company may be unable to refinance or repay the debt as it comes due 
debt restrictions may affect operations and negatively affect the company s ability to repay indebtedness at maturity the company s current million unsecured credit facility contains provisions that restrict the amount of distributions it can make 
these provisions provide that distributions may not exceed of funds from operations for any fiscal quarter 
if the company cannot obtain acceptable financing to repay indebtedness at maturity  it may have to sell properties to repay indebtedness or properties may be foreclosed upon  which could adversely affect its results of operations  financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  as of december   approximately million of the company s total indebtedness included secured mortgages with cross collateralization provisions 
in the event of a default  the holders of this indebtedness may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan 
this may  in turn  accelerate other indebtedness secured by these properties 
foreclosure of properties would cause a loss to the company of income and asset value 
fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect the company s operations as of december   the company had approximately million of variable interest rate indebtedness 
accordingly  an increase in interest rates will adversely affect the company s net income and results of operations 
management of newly acquired properties could be difficult since the consolidation on december   and through december   the company acquired approximately billion in properties 
to manage these new properties effectively  the company has sought to successfully apply its experience managing its existing portfolio to expanded markets and to an increased number of properties 
the assimilation of these properties is a continuing process whose success cannot be assured indefinitely 
should the company encounter future difficulties in managing these newly acquired properties  this could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions could adversely affect operations consistent with the company s growth strategy  the company is continually pursuing and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
from time to time the company is actively considering the possible acquisition of specific properties  which may include properties managed by gc or owned by affiliated parties 
it is possible that one or more of such possible future acquisitions  if completed  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
potential adverse consequences of transactions involving conflicts of interest the company has acquired  and from time to time may acquire  properties from partnerships that robert batinovich  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  and andrew batinovich  the company s president and chief operating officer  control  and in which they and members of their families have substantial interests 
these transactions involve or will involve conflicts of interest 
these transactions also may provide substantial economic benefits to those individuals such as payments or issuances of partnership units in the operating partnership  relief or deferral of tax liabilities  relief of primary or secondary liability for debt  and reduction in exposure to other property related liabilities 
the company s policy provides that interested directors may not vote with regard to transactions in which they have a substantial interest 
these transactions may only be completed if they are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors  with the interested directors abstaining 
despite this policy and the presence of appraisals or fairness opinions or review by parties who have no interest in the transactions  the transactions will not be the product of arm s length negotiation 
these transactions may not be as favorable to the company as transactions that it negotiates with unrelated parties and they could result in undue benefit to robert and andrew batinovich and members of their families 
none of these parties has guaranteed that any properties acquired from entities they control or in which they have a significant interest will be as profitable as other investments made by the company or will not result in losses 
dependence on executive officers the company depends on the efforts of robert batinovich  its chief executive officer and andrew batinovich  its president and chief operating officer  and of its other executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of them could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
both robert and andrew batinovich have entered into employment agreements with the company 
potential liability due to environmental matters under federal  state and local laws relating to protection of the environment environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances on the property 
these owners may be required to investigate and clean up the contamination on the property as well as the contamination which has migrated from the property 
environmental laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contamination 
this liability may be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
in addition  the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on personal injury  property damage and or other costs  including investigation and clean up costs  resulting from environmental contamination 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses may be operated 
these restrictions may require expenditures 
under the environmental laws  any person who arranges for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of investigation or clean up of those substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
tenants of the company s properties generally are required by their leases to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental laws  and to indemnify the company against any environmental liability arising from their activities on the properties 
however  the company could be subject to environmental liability relating to its management of the properties or strict liability by virtue of its ownership interest in the properties 
also tenants may not satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases 
the company is also subject to the risk that any environmental assessments of its properties  properties being considered for acquisition  or the properties owned by the partnerships managed by gc may not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  any prior owner or prior or current operator of such properties may have created an environmental condition not known to the company  or an environmental condition may otherwise exist as to any one or more of such properties 
any one of these conditions could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition or ability to service debt  either directly with respect to its properties  or indirectly with respect to properties owned by partnerships managed by gc 
any condition adversely affecting the financial condition of gc could adversely affect the company by diminishing the value of its interest in gc 
moreover  future environmental laws  ordinances or regulations may have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  the current environmental condition of those properties may be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to the company 
environmental assessments and potential liability due to asbestos containing materials environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos containing building materials 
these laws require that asbestos containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and that those who may come into contact with asbestos containing building materials be adequately informed and trained 
they also require that special precautions  including removal or other abatement  be undertaken in the event asbestos containing building materials is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
they also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
all of the properties that the company presently owns have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
some of the phase i environmental assessments recommended further investigations in the form of phase ii environmental assessments  including soil and groundwater sampling 
the company has completed all of these investigations or is in the process of completing them 
certain of the company s properties have been found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
the company believes that these materials have been adequately contained and it has implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
some  but not all  of the properties owned by partnerships managed by gc have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
gc determines on a case by case basis whether to obtain phase i environmental assessments on these properties and whether to undertake further investigation or remediation 
certain of these properties contain asbestos containing building materials 
in each case gc believes that these materials have been adequately contained and has implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program has been implemented for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
potential environmental liability resulting from underground storage tanks some of the company s properties  as well as properties that it has previously owned  are leased or have been leased to owners or operators of businesses that use  store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these businesses include dry cleaners that operate on site dry cleaning plants and auto care centers 
some of these properties contain  or may have contained  underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations create a potential for the release of those substances 
some of the company s properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
several of the company s properties have been contaminated with these substances from on site operations or operations on adjacent or nearby properties 
in addition  certain of the company s properties are on  or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others  including former owners or tenants of the properties  have engaged or may engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
environmental liabilities may adversely affect operating costs and ability to borrow the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws as well as the cost of complying with future legislation may affect the company s operating costs 
in addition  the presence of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances at any of the company s properties  or the failure to remediate those properties properly  may adversely affect its ability to borrow by using those properties as collateral 
the cost of defending against claims of liability and the cost of complying with environmental laws  including investigation or clean up of contaminated property  could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
general risks of ownership of real estate the company is subject to risks generally incidental to the ownership of real estate 
these risks include changes in general economic or local conditions  changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area  the impact of environmental protection laws  changes in interest rates and availability of financing which may render the sale or financing of a property difficult or unattractive  changes in tax  real estate and zoning laws  and the creation of mechanics liens or similar encumbrances placed on the property by a lessee or other parties without the company s knowledge and consent 
should any of these events occur  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
general risks associated with management  leasing and brokerage contracts the company is subject to the risks generally associated with the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses 
these risks include the risk that management contracts or service agreements may be terminated  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be renewed on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing and brokerage activity generally may decline 
in addition  the company s acquisition of properties from partnerships managed by gc or another subsidiary could result in a decrease in revenues to such subsidiary and a corresponding decrease in dividends received by the company from such subsidiary 
each of these developments could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
to maintain the company s status as a reit while realizing income from gc s third party management business  the capital stock of gc is divided into two classes 
all of the voting common stock of gc  representing of gc s total equity  is held by individual stockholders 
nonvoting preferred stock representing the remaining equity of gc is held entirely by the operating partnership 
although the operating partnership holds a majority of the equity interest in gc  it is not able to elect gc s directors 
uninsured losses may adversely affect operations the company  or in certain instances  tenants of the properties  carry comprehensive liability  fire and extended coverage with respect to the properties 
this coverage has policy specification and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  certain types of losses such as from earthquakes and floods may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
further  certain of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity and floods 
should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake or flood  the company may incur losses due to insurance deductibles  co payments on insured losses or uninsured losses 
should an uninsured loss occur  the company could lose some or all of its capital investment  cash flow and anticipated profits related to one or more properties 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
illiquidity of real estate may limit our ability to vary the company s portfolio real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  will tend to limit the company s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and individual agreements with sellers of properties place limits on the company s ability to sell properties 
fifty five of the company s properties were acquired on terms and conditions under which they can be disposed of only in a like kind exchange or other non taxable transaction 
the agreed upon time periods for these restrictions on dispositions vary from transaction to transaction 
potential liability under the americans with disabilities act as of january   all of the company s properties were required to be in compliance with the americans with disabilities act 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that places of public accommodation be made accessible to people with disabilities to the extent readily achievable 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements could require removal of access barriers 
non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government  an award of damages to private litigants and or a court order to remove access barriers 
because of the limited history of the americans with disabilities act  the impact of its application to the company s properties  including the extent and timing of required renovations  is uncertain 
pursuant to lease agreements with tenants in certain of the single tenant properties  the tenants are obligated to comply with the americans with disabilities act provisions 
if the company s costs are greater than anticipated or tenants are unable to meet their obligations  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
development alliances may adversely affect operations the company may  from time to time  enter into alliances with selected developers for the purpose of developing new projects in which these developers have  in the opinion of management  significant expertise or experience 
these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
these development activities also may entail certain risks  including the risk that management may expend funds on and devote time to projects which may not come to fruition  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated 
in addition  the partners in development alliances may have significant control over the operation of the alliance project 
therefore  these investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks such as the possibility that the partner might become bankrupt  have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company s business interest or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to the company s instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives 
consequently  actions by a partner in a development alliance might subject property owned by the alliance to additional risk 
although the company will seek to maintain sufficient control of any alliance to permit its objectives to be achieved  the company may be unable to take action without the approval of its development alliance partners 
conversely  the company s development alliance partners could take actions binding on the alliance without the company s consent 
in addition  should a partner in a development alliance become bankrupt the company could become liable for the partner s share of the project s liabilities 
these risks may result in a development project adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
material tax risks since  the company has operated as a reit under the code 
however  the company may not be able to maintain its status as a reit 
to qualify as a reit the company must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions 
only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company s control 
the company receives nonqualifying management fee income and owns nonqualifying preferred stock in certain subsidiaries 
as a result  the company may approach the income and asset test limits imposed by the code 
there is a risk that the company may not satisfy these tests 
in order to avoid exceeding the asset test limit  for example  the company may have to reduce its interest in its subsidiaries 
the company is relying on the opinion of its tax counsel regarding its ability to qualify as a reit 
this legal opinion  however  is not binding on the internal revenue service irs 
consequences of failure to qualify as a reit if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at corporate rates 
in addition  the company also may be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify 
this would reduce the company s net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability 
in addition  the company would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders 
even if the company continues to qualify as a reit  it will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
possible changes in tax laws  effect on the market value of real estate investments income tax treatment of reits may be modified by legislative  judicial or administrative action at any time 
these changes may be applied to past as well as future operations 
legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 
in addition  the changes might also indirectly affect the market value of all real estate investments  and consequently the company s ability to realize its investment objectives 
additional capital requirements  possible adverse effects on holders of equity the company s ability to continue its growth pattern established in  which was funded largely through the raising of equity capital  depends in large part upon its ability to raise additional capital in the future on satisfactory terms 
if the company raises additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities  or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities  the interests of holders of the company s shares of common stock could be diluted 
likewise  the company s board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights of the preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights which may dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of the company s shares of common stock 
if the company raises additional capital through debt financing  it will be subject to the risks described below  among others 
the company s indebtedness restrictions may adversely affect its ability to incur indebtedness the company s organizational documents limit its ability to incur additional debt if the total debt  including the additional debt  would exceed of the borrowing base 
this debt limitation in the company s charter can only be amended by an affirmative vote of the majority of all outstanding stock entitled to vote on such amendment 
the term borrowing base is defined as the greater of fair market value or total market capitalization 
fair market value is based upon the value of the company s assets as determined by an independent appraiser 
total market capitalization is the sum of the market value of the company s outstanding capital stock  including shares issuable on exercise of redemption options by holders of units of the limited partnership  plus debt 
an exception is made for refinancings and borrowings required to make distributions to maintain the company s status as a reit 
in light of these debt restrictions  it should be noted that a change in the value of the company s common stock could affect the borrowing base  and therefore its ability to incur additional indebtedness  even though such change in the common stock s value is unrelated to the company s liquidity 
limitation on ownership of common stock and stockholder s rights plan may preclude acquisition of control provisions of the company s charter are designed to assist the company in maintaining its qualification as a reit under the code by preventing concentrated ownership of the company which might jeopardize reit qualification 
among other things  these provisions provide that any transfer or acquisition of the company s common or preferred stock that would result in its disqualification as a reit under the code will be void  and if any person attempts to acquire shares of the company s common or preferred stock that after the acquisition would cause the person to own an amount of common stock and preferred stock in excess of a predetermined limit  such acquisitions would be void 
ownership is determined by operation of certain attribution rules set out in the code 
pursuant to board action  the limit currently is of the value of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock the ownership limitation 
the common stock or preferred stock the transfer of which would cause any person to violate the ownership limitation  is referred to as the excess shares 
a transfer that would violate the ownership limitation will be void and the common stock or preferred stock subject to the transfer will automatically be transferred to an unaffiliated trustee for the benefit of a charitable organization designated by the board of directors until sold by the trustee to a third party or purchased by the company 
this limitation on the ownership of common stock and preferred stock may preclude the acquisition of control of the company by a third party without the consent of the board of directors 
if the board of directors waives the ownership limitation for any person  the ownership limitation will be proportionally and automatically reduced with regard to all other persons such that no five persons may own more than of the value of the common stock and preferred stock 
certain other provisions contained in the company s charter and bylaws may also have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for the company and may thereby inhibit a change in control in the company even if a change in control would be in the best interests of the stockholders 
in addition  in july  the board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  the company declared a dividend of rights on its common stock 
the rights issued under the plan will be triggered  with certain exceptions  if and when any person or group acquires  or commences a tender offer to acquire  or more of the company s shares 
the rights plan is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with the board of directors 
however  it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of the company  even if a majority of the company s stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition  and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 
losses relating to consolidation the company was created through the merger of eight partnerships and a corporation the consolidation 
prior to the completion of the consolidation  two lawsuits were filed in contesting the fairness of the consolidation  one in california state court and one in federal court 
the complaints in both actions alleged  among other things  breaches by the defendants of fiduciary duties and inadequate disclosures 
the state court action was settled over the objection of certain parties  and the settlement was approved or review denied by the superior court of the state of california in and for san mateo county  the california state court of appeals  the california supreme court and the supreme court of the united states 
in the federal action  the court in december of deferred all further proceedings pending a ruling in the state court action 
following the final resolution of the state court action  the defendants in january filed a motion to dismiss the federal court action 
as of the date of this report  the plaintiffs had failed to file a timely responsive pleading  so the defendants intend to move for final dismissal 
the company believes that it is very unlikely that this litigation would result in a liability that would exceed the accrued liability by a material amount 
however  given the inherent uncertainties of litigation  there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcomes of these actions will be favorable to the company 
from time to time the company is involved in other litigation arising out of its business activities 
certain other claims and lawsuits have arisen against the company in its normal course of business 
it is possible that this litigation and the other litigation previously described could result in significant losses in excess of amounts reserved  which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
uncertainty due to the board of directors ability to change investment policies the board of directors may change the company s investment policies without a vote of the stockholders 
if the company s investment policies change  the risks and potential rewards of an investment in the shares may also change 
in addition  the methods of implementing the company s investment policies may vary as new investment techniques are developed 
effect of market interest rates on price of common stock the annual yield on the price paid for shares of the company s common stock from distributions by the company may influence the market price of the shares of its common stock in public markets 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of the company s common stock to seek a higher annual yield from their investments 
this may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
shares available for future sale the company cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of its common stock or future conversions or exercises of securities for future sales will have on the market price of its common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect the prevailing market price for the company s common stock 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative information about market risk interest rates the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates obtainable on its mortgage loans receivable and its secured and unsecured borrowings 
the company does not believe that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on the performance or fair value of its portfolio of mortgage loans receivable 
it is the company s policy to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in order to maximize financial flexibility when selling properties and minimize potential prepayment penalties on fixed rate loans  the company has also entered into variable rate debt arrangements 
approximately and of the company s outstanding debt  including amounts borrowed under the credit facility  were subject to variable rates at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the average interest rate on the company s debt increased from at december  to at december  the company reviews interest rate exposure in the portfolio quarterly in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the company does not have any other material market sensitive financial instruments 
it is not the company s policy to engage in hedging activities for previously outstanding debt instruments or for speculative or trading purposes 
the company may enter into forward interest rate  or similar  agreements to hedge specific anticipated debt issuances where management believes the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  the company is entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  the company makes payment in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
at december   the company was not a party to any forward interest rate or similar agreements other than the interest rate cap contract associated with the secured financing loan discussed above 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date 
expected maturity date fair thereafter total value in thousands secured fixed         average interest rate secured variable      average interest rate unsecured fixed    average interest rate unsecured variable     average interest rate the company believes that the interest rates given in the table for fixed rate borrowings approximate the rates the company could currently obtain for instruments of similar terms and maturities and that the fair values of such instruments approximate carrying value at december  a change of in the index rate to which the company s variable rate debt is tied would change the annual interest incurred by the company by  based upon the balances outstanding on variable rate instruments at december
