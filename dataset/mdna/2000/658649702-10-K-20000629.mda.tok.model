item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview north coast is engaged in the acquisition and enhancement of developed producing properties and the exploration  development and production of undeveloped natural gas and oil properties  owned by the company or in conjunction with joint ventures or partnerships sponsored and managed by the company 
north coast derives its revenues from its own oil and gas production  turnkey drilling  well operations  gas gathering  transportation and gas marketing services it provides for third parties 
during the fiscal year ended march   north coast executed successful acquisition and drilling and development activities that resulted in significant increases in its operations  proved reserves and financial results 
well operations increased from  wells operated at march  to  at march  north coast s proved developed natural gas reserves increased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for the fiscal year ended march  and proved developed oil reserves increased to  barrels from  barrels 
the increase in well operations and proved reserves at the fiscal year end resulted from the acquisitions of properties and reserves of environmental exploration and peake energy  inc combined with a successful exploration program and drilling and development activities 
the proved gas reserves developed and undeveloped increased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for fiscal the increase in proved gas reserves was due to the increases mentioned previously for the proved developed reserves 
proved oil reserves developed and undeveloped increased to  barrels for fiscal from  barrels for fiscal north coast recognizes as proved undeveloped reserves only the potential oil and gas which can reasonably be expected to be recovered from drillable locations which it owned or had rights to at fiscal year end which are directly offsetting locations to wells that have indicated commercial production in the objective formation and which north coast fully expects to drill in the very near future 
changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are set forth in note of the company s financial statements 
the above mentioned additions and sales of natural gas  coupled with the development costs associated with undeveloped acreage  create timing differences which are reflected in the other category of the standardized measure 
of the company s total proved reserves  approximately are proved developed and approximately are proved undeveloped based upon equivalent unit mcfs 
proved undeveloped acreage requires considerable capital expenditures to develop 
management believes that a significant percentage of the proved undeveloped reserves should be recovered in future years  although no assurance of such recovery can be given

oil and gas prices have not followed inflation and have fluctuated during recent years as a result of other forces such as opec  economic factors  demand for and supply of natural gas in the united states and within the company s regional area of operation 
oil prices during the company s fiscal year have increased as a result of continued production constraints by members of opec which has reduced the available supply of crude oil to world markets 
natural gas prices have also increased particularly during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march   and more so subsequent to that date 
these increases in price are attributed to lower storage supplies following the winter of and higher natural gas demand for the generation of electricity in the united states

currently  north coast sells natural gas under fixed price contracts  on the spot market and through a fixed price commodity hedge 
the company has positioned itself to take advantage of current market conditions by fixing a greater portion of its gas to contracts of a year or longer at prices substantially higher than were received in recent years 
additionally  the company continues to acquire and construct new pipeline systems to transport natural gas from company wells and third parties
