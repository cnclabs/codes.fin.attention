per diluted share  on net sales of  for the previous fiscal year 
the percent increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in gross shipments within the juvenile  bestseller and basic reference categories to our core customers and  to a lesser extent  increased sales from our international subsidiaries 
we experienced a percent rate of returns from customers in fiscal compared with percent in fiscal this decrease is a result of continued improvement in efficiency and the refinement of our proprietary vmi program with our core customers

gross profit for fiscal reached  an increase of  from the fiscal level 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was percent in fiscal compared with percent in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit margin was primarily a result of increased sell through of proprietary product  reduced markdown expenses  and increased income from publisher incentive programs 
distribution and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  these expenses rose to percent from percent for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to the normally higher operating expenses in our international subsidiaries and the continued investment in our corporate infrastructure 
these infrastructure costs include hiring for key new positions  systems enhancements and facility expansion required to strategically grow our business 
interest and dividend income increased to  in fiscal from  in the previous fiscal year as a result of increased average investment balances 
see liquidity and capital resources 
our combined federal and state effective tax rate decreased to percent in fiscal compared to percent for the prior fiscal year

fiscal compared to fiscal net diluted income for the fiscal year ended march  was  or 
per diluted share  on net sales of  this compares to net income of  or 
per diluted share  on net sales of  for the previous fiscal year 
the percent increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in gross shipments within the bestseller  mass paperback and gift book art and coffee table books categories to core customers as well as sales from our uk subsidiary  aura books  plc  acquired in march we experienced a percent rate of returns from customers in fiscal compared with percent in fiscal consistent with our previous practices  reserves have been established based on management s best estimate of expected future product returns 
gross profit for fiscal reached  an increase of  from the fiscal level 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was percent in fiscal compared with percent in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher income from publisher incentive programs and increased sales from our international subsidiaries  which typically achieve higher gross margins while at comparatively higher distribution and administrative expense levels 
distribution and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  these expenses rose to percent from percent for the prior fiscal year 
this increase primarily reflected the addition of aura books  plc as well as non recurring costs associated with exiting our retail activities 
the retail outlets were originally established as cost recovery vehicles for non returnable residual product from our purchasing and publishing activities 
in fiscal  we continued our efforts to increase the efficiency of the disposition of non returnable product and began to utilize a small team of associates dedicated to selling the remainder product 
based on the success of this relatively low cost  low overhead effort  management decided to phase out the retail stores 
the non recurring costs associated with exiting the retail operations were approximately  interest and dividend income decreased to  in fiscal from  in the previous fiscal year as a result of reduced investment balances 
our combined federal and state statutory tax rate increased from approximately percent in fiscal to approximately percent in fiscal as a result of our higher income level 
the fiscal provision for income tax was percent  with tax exempt interest income offsetting foreign currency exchange losses 
the fiscal provision for income taxes was percent as a result of various adjustments including the tax benefit of a loss carryforward on one of our foreign operations as well as tax exempt interest income offset  in part  by foreign currency exchange losses 
seasonality our net sales and earnings in the third fiscal quarter have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  significantly higher than in any other quarter due to the holiday season 
income from operations during the third fiscal quarter  as a percentage of net sales  is typically higher than in any other quarter because of product sales mix and other economies of scale caused by the higher sales volume 
we expect seasonality in operations to continue 
we experience significant seasonal short term swings in our cash position due to sales seasonality and to differences in timing of payments to our vendors and the receipt of payments from our customers 
cash flow has been historically greatest during the third fiscal quarter due to higher seasonal sales 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended march    of cash was provided by operating activities 
in the prior year   of cash was provided by operating activities 
at march   our cash and investments had increased by  compared to march   primarily due to income from operations offset  in part  by acquisitions  our stock repurchases and the strategic growth of our corporate infrastructure 
trade accounts receivable increased  compared to one year ago primarily due to an increase in net sales  offset  in part  by an improvement in the number of days sales outstanding 
inventories at march  increased  compared to march   due in part to increased sales activity  an approximate percent increase in sku count to address our expanding our customer base  and the timing of returns to publishers of certain titles 
the increase in inventory was offset  in part  by an increase in accounts payable 
the working capital required to finance inventories is directly related to inventory turnover rate and trade credit terms provided by publishers 
trade credit terms from our vendors did not change significantly during fiscal inventory turns increased slightly to times in fiscal from times in fiscal the improvement in inventory turns is a result of the reduced inventory value as a percentage of cost of sales which is related  in part  to the purchasing efficiencies gained from a better understanding of our customers needs through the use of our proprietary vmi software program 
we had available at march  an unsecured bank line of credit with a maximum borrowing limit of million 
the interest rate on bank borrowings is based on the prime rate and libor rates 
the line of credit expires july  and we are currently reviewing terms for renewal 
we did not borrow on our line of credit during fiscal or fiscal we believe that our working capital  cash flows from operations  trade credit traditionally available from our vendors and our million line of credit will be sufficient to finance our current and anticipated level of operations 
although we have no commitments to do so at the present time  we may consider additional strategic acquisitions where deemed appropriate 
such acquisitions  if any  could affect our liquidity and capital resources 
impact of inflation we have been subject to relatively low prevailing inflation rates in all countries in which we operate  with the exception of mexico  during fiscal  and we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices in all countries in which we operate to offset increased costs of merchandise and we expect to be able to continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
while our mexico operations are not a significant part of our overall activities  the continued high rates of inflation in mexico may result in future foreign currency exchange losses 
computer operations and the year during fiscal and fiscal  we developed a plan to address anticipated year issues in connection with our data processing and other activities  including non information technology based systems 
the cost for review  analysis  modification and testing of existing computer programs for both internal and external software approximated  and was expensed as incurred 
due to the fact that we primarily employed outside consultants for year remediation related work  there has not been any deferral of other information technology related projects  nor was there a requirement to hire additional personnel solely for year compliance issues 
we have not experienced any significant year problems

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to changes in interest rates primarily from securities held in our investment portfolio 
fluctuations in interest rates may affect the ending fair value of our investments  anticipated future cash flows  and the realization of earnings from such investments 
our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid short term investments that are typically held for the duration of the respective instrument 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our cash equivalents 
as of march   our investments of approximately  are scheduled to mature within one year and approximately  are scheduled to mature within two years 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions  or transactions to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
accordingly  we believe that  while the securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
we are subject to foreign currency exposure due to the operation of our foreign subsidiaries  which generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated into us dollars 
the primarily currencies to which we have foreign currency exposure are the british pound  mexican peso  and the australian dollar 
we generally view as long term our investments in our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not utilize any hedging transactions against these net investments 
our foreign operations are not a significant part of our overall activities and we believe that the risk associated with our foreign currency exposure is not material on a consolidated basis
