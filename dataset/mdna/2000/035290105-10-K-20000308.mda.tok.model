item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currencies  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company has entered into interest rate agreements which effectively fix or cap the libor component of the interest rate on a portion of its floating rate obligations 
as a result  the interest rate on approximately and of debt obligations at december  and january   respectively  is fixed or capped 
see note  interest rate agreements  and note  debt  of the consolidated financial statements for further detail on interest agreements and debt obligations outstanding 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its derivatives and other financial instruments assuming a percentage point adverse change in interest rates and a percent adverse change in the foreign currency contracts outstanding 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse changes would increase interest expense by million and foreign exchange losses by million 
the effect of the interest change on the fair market value of the outstanding debt is insignificant 
these analyses did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure
