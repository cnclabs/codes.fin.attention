item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general demand for brown paper packaging has historically corresponded primarily to changes in the rate of growth of the manufacturing sector in the us economy 
growth in the us economy generally stimulates demand for packaging products 
historically  the industry s cyclical nature has been driven by the inelasticity of supply due to the capital intensive nature of the industry 
because productive capacity cannot be added quickly  containerboard and unbleached kraft paper inventory levels tend to fall during periods of rising demand  exerting upward pressure on prices 
in periods when capacity exceeds demand  efforts to control inventory levels have been viewed as limited  because containerboard and unbleached kraft paper mills operate most economically near capacity operating levels 
the rationalization of capacity associated with industry consolidation activities and reduced capacity utilization rates over the past several years combined with limited new containerboard capacity additions and stable domestic demand have resulted in relatively balanced industry supply demand conditions 
demand for unbleached kraft paper has declined in recent years due to displacement by plastics 
the company can vary its production of unbleached kraft paper  depending on market conditions  because all four of the company s paper machines that produce unbleached kraft paper also have the capability to produce containerboard 
published prices for linerboard recovered from the cyclical low in fiscal by average year over year increases of approximately percent  percent and percent in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
average grocery sack paper prices remained flat in fiscal from fiscal and increased year over year percent and percent in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
results of operations year ended september  fiscal compared with year ended september  fiscal 
net sales for fiscal were  million  an increase of percent compared with net sales of million in fiscal operating income for fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal fiscal resulted in a net profit of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal sales in fiscal were favorably affected by higher average net selling prices and higher corrugated shipments  which increased net sales by approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
also  the acquisition of s g packaging increased net sales million in fiscal gross margin increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year primarily due to higher prices for the company s products of million net of million of higher containerboard and kraft paper costs 
the higher prices were somewhat offset by higher fiber costs of million and higher energy costs of million 
corrugated shipments increased approximately percent in fiscal to billion square feet compared to billion square feet in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased demand for our products 
multiwall bag shipments increased approximately percent to thousand tons in fiscal compared to thousand tons in the prior year 
total mill production decreased by percent to  tons per day tpd  calculated on the basis of the number of days in the period in fiscal compared to  tpd in fiscal as a result of the company taking market related downtime 
containerboard production decreased approximately percent to  tpd in fiscal compared to  tpd in fiscal unbleached kraft paper production remained relatively unchanged at tpd in fiscal compared to tpd in fiscal average selling prices increased approximately percent for corrugated products and increased approximately percent for multiwall bags in fiscal compared to fiscal average selling prices increased for the company s domestic linerboard  export linerboard and unbleached kraft paper by approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal fiber costs increased primarily due to higher average delivered costs for recycled fiber 
the average delivered cost for occ old corrugated containers and dlk double lined kraft clippings increased approximately percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased global demand 
in contrast  the average delivered cost for wood chips decreased by approximately percent in fiscal compared to the prior year 
selling and administrative costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of selling and administrative costs of s g packaging and management reorganization costs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  emission credits in california with a book value of million were sold for million 
this resulted in a gain of million after deducting costs associated with the sale of approximately million 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher average debt levels increased interest expense by approximately million and higher average borrowing rates increased interest expense by approximately million 
the company recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal the effective tax rate was approximately and percent in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the unusually high tax rate in fiscal was the result of the relatively high level of permanent differences between book and taxable income compared to the low level of pre tax income 
year ended september  fiscal compared with year ended september  fiscal 
net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of percent compared with net sales of million in fiscal operating income for fiscal was million compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal fiscal resulted in a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal  which included a million extraordinary loss per share on the early retirement of debt 
sales in fiscal were unfavorably affected by lower average net selling prices  which decreased net sales by approximately million 
higher corrugated shipments increased net sales by approximately million in the year to year comparison 
gross margin increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year primarily due to lower fiber costs million and higher volume million 
these improvements were offset in part by reduced earnings from the company s chemical subsidiary  as a result of a significant decline in demand for the subsidiary s products in asian markets in the first half of fiscal million 
corrugated shipments increased approximately percent in fiscal to billion square feet compared to billion square feet in fiscal  primarily as a result of opening a new sheet feeder plant in the first quarter of fiscal and increased demand 
multiwall bag shipments decreased approximately percent to thousand tons in fiscal compared to thousand tons in the prior year 
total mill production increased by percent to  tons per day tpd  calculated on the basis of the number of days in the period in fiscal compared to  tpd in fiscal containerboard production increased approximately percent to  tpd in fiscal compared to  tpd in fiscal unbleached kraft paper production increased approximately percent to tpd in fiscal from tpd in fiscal average selling prices were essentially unchanged for corrugated products and increased approximately percent for multiwall bags due mainly to a mix change in fiscal compared to the prior year 
average selling prices decreased for the company s domestic linerboard  export linerboard and unbleached kraft paper  by approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal fiber costs decreased primarily due to lower average delivered costs for recycled fiber and wood chips 
the average delivered cost for occ old corrugated containers and dlk double lined kraft clippings decreased approximately percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased demand 
in addition  the average delivered cost for wood chips decreased by approximately percent in fiscal compared to the prior year 
unusually wet weather in the southern us resulted in higher wood chip costs in fiscal selling and administrative costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to higher information system costs related primarily to the year effort  and increased long term incentive and litigation costs 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher average debt levels increased interest expense by approximately million  while lower average borrowing rates reduced interest expense by approximately million 
the lower average borrowing rates resulted primarily from the refinancing of the company s senior subordinated debentures in the second quarter of fiscal the company recognized a tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the tax benefit decreased in the year over year comparison primarily due to improved operating results in fiscal over fiscal the effective tax rate was approximately percent in both fiscal and fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company issued million principal amount of senior notes due in and million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in and used the proceeds to redeem and retire all of the then outstanding senior subordinated debentures million principal amount due in in conjunction with the retirement  approximately million of deferred financing fees were written off

in the third quarter of fiscal  the company refinanced its bank credit facility establishing a term loan and a new revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with this refinancing  approximately million of deferred financing fees were written off 
this transaction resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  net of an income tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources general the company has historically financed its operations through cash provided by operations  borrowings under its credit agreements and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the company s principal uses of cash are to pay operating expenses  fund capital expenditures and service debt 
the company is currently prohibited from paying dividends and making purchases of additional common stock by the terms of its bank credit agreement and public debt securities 
net cash provided by operations for fiscal was million as compared to net cash used by operations of million for fiscal the improvement was due to an increase of operating income for fiscal capital expenditures of million in fiscal increased by million from fiscal since its inception in  the company has made significant capital expenditures primarily to expand capacity  install advanced papermaking technology  improve product quality  realize operating efficiencies and maintain its existing facilities 
for fiscal  capital spending is expected to be in the range of to million  while capital spending beyond fiscal will be targeted to approximate the company s annual depreciation expense 
capital spending will  however  be adjusted from time to time as market conditions and available cash flows dictate 
in fiscal  the company determined it would be unlikely that its antioch  california unbleached kraft paper mill the east mill  which was closed in fiscal  could be sold as a mill site or that the east mill  or a portion thereof  could be operated economically by the company 
in fiscal  the company incurred approximately million of costs for demolition and asbestos removal and to maintain the east mill 
such costs were net of proceeds from the sale of scrap 
at the end of fiscal no material spending remained for demolition work and the net book value of the east mill was million 
in connection with the acquisition of s g packaging  the company paid smurfit stone million for its percent interest 
in addition  smurfit stone forgave million of its trade receivable for kraft paper sold to s g packaging 
the company repaid  through borrowings on its own revolver  million outstanding on s g packaging s revolving loan facility  which was then terminated 
the company recorded accruals of approximately million to purchase accounting reserves relating to severance and closure costs 
in addition  in the first and second quarters of fiscal the company recorded through income from operations million related to such closure costs in respect of its pre existing ownership of s g packaging 
these costs were associated primarily with the integration of s g packaging s corporate headquarters facility and the closure of the s g packaging facility in yulee  florida 
during fiscal million was expended related to such costs and million was reversed within the purchase price allocation  as the cost of management s plan was less than originally estimated 
the balance of the related reserves at september   was million 
substantially all of the remaining accrual primarily lease termination costs will be expended over the next six months 
liquidity at september   the company had cash and equivalents of million  a decrease of million from september  as cash used in financing and investments exceeded cash provided by operations 
total debt of million decreased by million from million at september  the decrease in borrowings was primarily due to improved earnings from operations and the gain from the sale of emission credits 
in august  the company extended and expanded its trade receivables backed revolving credit facility 
the facility was extended to and the facility was expanded from million to million of which approximately million was available and outstanding at september  in addition  during fiscal  the company and its lenders amended the financial covenants of the bank credit agreement to provide additional financial flexibility 
the company had approximately million of revolver borrowings outstanding and approximately million available under the revolving portion of its credit agreements at september  at september   the company had primary working capital of million  an increase of million from september   due to increased inventories  offset somewhat by increased trade payables  both of which were primarily due to the acquisition of s g packaging 
the rationalization of capacity associated with industry consolidation activities and reduced capacity utilization rates over the past several years combined with limited new containerboard capacity additions and stable domestic demand has resulted in relatively balanced industry supply demand conditions 
during fiscal  published prices of linerboard and grocery sack paper increased by per ton 
subsequently  the company implemented corresponding price increases for its corrugated products in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  average delivered costs for wood chips increased by approximately percent compared to the third quarter of the fiscal year 
average delivered prices for occ and dlk decreased approximately and percent  respectively  in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter of fiscal fiber markets are difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance of the future direction of occ  dlk and wood chip prices 
based on current prices for converted products  current raw material and energy costs and assuming maintenance levels of capital spending  the company believes that cash provided by operations and borrowings available under its credit agreements will provide adequate liquidity to meet debt service obligations and other liquidity requirements over the next to months
