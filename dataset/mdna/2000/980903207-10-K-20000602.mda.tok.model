certain factors that may affect future results the company does not provide forecasts of its future financial performance 
however  from time to time information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases and oral statements which are not historical facts constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements and there can be no assurance that the results set forth in those statements will be achieved 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
because the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from software license fees  the company s quarterly and annual operating results are sensitive to the size  timing and shipment of individual orders  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or the lengthening of the sales cycle either generally or with respect to individual customers 
in addition  the company s continued growth is dependent on achieving broader market acceptance of its products  including the recently introduced wtc productcenter and the growth of the product data management market and the ability of the company to introduce enhancements and additional integrations to its products in a timely manner to meet the evolving needs of its customers 
the company also relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of those rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the segment of the software industry in which the company is engaged is extremely competitive 
certain current and potential competitors of the company are more established and benefit from greater market recognition and have substantially greater financial  development and marketing resources than the company 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are impacted by a variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the timing and shipment of enhancements to the company s products and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  an unanticipated shortfall in revenue in a quarter may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and stock price
