fluctuations in annual and quarterly results may occur as a result of factors affecting demand for the company s products such as the timing of the company s and competitors new product introductions and upgrades and the information technology budgets for companies 
due to such fluctuations  historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
in addition  due to the company s re focus of its business into the esupport business in april and the discontinuation of the sale of its historical products  the company s past performance may not be indicative of future operating results

during fiscal the company initiated significant changes to its business strategy  including the third quarter discontinuation of the marketing for its reachout and replica tape products  in order to focus on positioning the company in the esupport market 
although the company is no longer actively marketing these products  legacy revenues associated with these products are expected to continue throughout fiscal due to the recognition of previously deferred revenues related to product maintenance and license fees and the expiration of return rights for box product sold through the distributor retail channel in addition to residual product royalty revenues 
this change in business direction coupled with a decline in revenues from a major oem partner for royalties associated with the replica tape product contributed to the decrease in revenues in fiscal the decrease in fiscal revenues from those of is due to lower revenues received from royalties related to licenses of previo s data compression technology to operating system vendors 
royalty revenues were million in these royalty revenues were solely from agreements with microsoft and ibm  who were obligated to continue making payments under the licenses at the rate of million per quarter through december  with a final payment of million in the march quarter 
the company expects no further royalty revenues under these agreements with microsoft and ibm 
the decline in fiscal revenues compared to fiscal was further attributable to declining sales of reachout  which had reached a mature phase of the product life cycle 
this decline was partially offset by increased sales of replica tape  primarily due to higher oem revenues 
the company expects current and future revenues to be significantly impacted by the discontinuance of the reachout and replica tape products

gross margins were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margins in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to an increase in customer support capacity as the company prepared for customer needs relative to the new product offering  while at the same time experiencing declining revenues related to the discontinuance of the reachout and replica tape products 
gross margins were also less in fiscal than in fiscal due to increased obsolescence reserves taken for box product inventory  related to the company s discontinuation of sales of the reachout and replica tape products as discussed above 
the decrease in gross margins from fiscal to is due to the elimination of royalty revenues  which carry gross margin 
research and development the cost of product development consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits  overhead and outside contractors 
such expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in product development costs in fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to lower employee and consulting costs related to the reallocation of resources among development facilities in conjunction with the restructuring discussed below 
the decrease in product development costs in fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to lower product localization costs as well as lower employee and consulting costs as discussed above 
the increase in product development expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the company s lower revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company expects to continue to invest in the development of products for which it believes there is a need in the market  however  there is no assurance that product development programs invested in by the company will be successful or that products resulting from such programs will achieve market acceptance 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits of sales  marketing and customer support personnel  and consulting  advertising  promotional and overhead expenses 
these expenses were million in fiscal  million fiscal and million for fiscal the increase in costs in fiscal over those of the prior fiscal year is primarily due to the staffing of the company s enterprise sales organization and increased marketing and market research costs incurred in the development and implementation of the company s new market entry strategy 
the decrease in marketing and sales expense in fiscal from was due to corporate restructurings of these functional areas 
the restructurings refocused sales and marketing efforts towards developing corporate enterprise customers  rather than individual end users 
the increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the company s lower revenues in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal as compared to sales and marketing expenses are expected to remain the company s most significant ongoing operating expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries for administrative and corporate services personnel and legal and other professional fees 
such expenses were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the reduction in spending in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal reflects lower management costs and non recurring costs associated with previo s spin off of its former hi fn subsidiary 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the company s lower revenues in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal as compared to restructuring charges in fiscal  the company charged million to operations  related to two restructurings which occurred during the year 
the first restructuring charge was million and was completed in anticipation of the reorganization related to the december  spin off of the hi fn subsidiary 
primary components of the charge were losses on property and equipment abandonments million and severance and employee related liabilities paid for terminated employees million 
the second restructuring was million and was designed to contain development costs by utilizing offshore facilities for these functions 
the amount charged to restructuring included severance and employee related liabilities paid for terminated employees million and lease termination costs million 
as discussed above  in fiscal  the company reorganized its sales and marketing departments and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the principal components of the charge were losses on property and equipment abandonments million  severance and employee related liabilities million  lease termination costs million and consulting and outplacement related to the terminated employees million 
in fiscal  the company incurred an additional million related to this restructuring 
this additional amount represented severance and employee related liabilities that the company was not permitted to expense until the affected employees were notified of the termination and the company had committed to provide for such costs 
interest and other income interest and other income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal amount includes million related to the redemption of preferred shares of dynanet  inc held by the company which were received in connection with its acquisition of california software  inc in as the shares of dynanet were acquired as an adjunct to the california software acquisition  and at that time the fair value of these shares was not significant  the dynanet shares were recorded at no costs basis  therefore  the entire redemption value is currently treated as other income 
additionally  interest income in fiscal increased from that in fiscal due to higher interest rates and higher average invested cash balances 
the reduction in interest income from fiscal to was primarily due to lower invested balances during the fiscal year  as a result of the completion of the company s stock repurchase program in fiscal income taxes although the company incurred a tax loss for fiscal it did not recognize any significant resultant benefit as its opportunity for net operating loss carrybacks have been depleted 
the nominal net income tax charge recognized for the year is primarily associated with income taxes from foreign source revenues and the related statutory withholdings required by the foreign jurisdiction 
the company continues to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
for fiscal  the company reported a benefit from income taxes of million 
this amount reflects net operating loss carrybacks to be applied to prior periods tax liabilities 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was lower than the statutory federal and state rates due to applicable alternative minimum tax limitations on the company s net operating loss carryback 
for fiscal  the company reported a provision for income taxes of million  which is inclusive of a charge to establish a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets 
before the valuation allowance  the benefit for income taxes was million for an effective tax rate of in fiscal the valuation allowance was recorded as a result of an assessment made of future taxable income as required by accounting standards  made in conjunction with the anticipated spin off of the company s hi fn subsidiary 
the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal and state rates primarily due to non deductible expenses related to the spin off and due to differences in tax rules impacting foreign operations 
quarterly trends fluctuations in quarterly results are expected to be significantly impacted by the cessation of revenues from discontinued product lines  reachout and replica tape 
management does not expect the revenue streams from new product offerings to offset the decrease from the discontinued product lines until the end of fiscal in addition  the company historically has experienced significant fluctuations in its revenues and operating results  including net income loss  and anticipates that these fluctuations will continue 
the company operates with relatively little backlog of its software sales  and the majority of its software revenues each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
consequently  if near term demand for the company s products weakens in a given quarter  the company s operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
in addition  when the company announces enhanced versions of its software products  the announcement usually has the effect of slowing sales of the current version of the product as buyers delay their purchase 
quarterly results have been or may in the future be influenced by the timing of announcements or introductions of new products and product upgrades by the company or its competitors  distributor ordering patterns  product returns  delays in product development and licensing of the company s products and core technology 
in addition  the company s esupport essentials product offering may have a lengthy evaluation period before any purchase is made 
seasonality the software industry has typically experienced some seasonal variations in demand  with sales declining somewhat in the summer months 
the company believes that its software sales are subject to similar seasonal variations which  when combined with the other factors described above  are likely to result in fluctuations in the company s quarterly results 
as a result  historical quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
stock price volatility due to the factors noted above  the company s stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or the investment community in general could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
shortfalls could be caused by shortfalls in revenues  timing of the receipt of technology license fees  and or increased levels of expenditures 
additionally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of the company s stock price 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by million to million at september  from million at september  accounts receivable decreased by million to million at september  from that at september   primarily attributable to previo s discontinuation of its distribution business and the corresponding elimination of distributor receivable balances 
working capital decreased by million to million at september  from that at september   primarily as a result of increases in liabilities largely related to accruals for potential tax liabilities and increases in deferred revenues 
the company believes that existing cash balances and funds provided by operations will be sufficient to finance its working capital requirements for a minimum of the next twelve months 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
the company s foreign currency risks are mitigated principally by maintaining only nominal foreign currency cash balances 
working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of the company s subsidiary in the united kingdom are kept in the local currencies for the european countries in which they do business  with excess funds converted to united states currency and transferred to previo s offices in the united states for investment 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at september   was million 
the company s investment policy is to manage its portfolio of marketable securities in order to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return 
at september   the company s portfolio was primarily invested in high quality commercial paper  typically with maturities of less than six months 
these investments are distributed among several issuers to minimize the credit risk associated with any single institution
