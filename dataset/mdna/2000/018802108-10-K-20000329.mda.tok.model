utility industry outlook as a holding company with significant utility assets  alliant energy competes in an ever changing utility industry 
set forth below is an overview of this evolving marketplace 
electric energy generation  transmission and distribution are in a period of fundamental change in the manner in which customers obtain  and energy suppliers provide  energy services 
as legislative  regulatory  economic and technological changes occur  electric utilities are facing increased numbers of alternative suppliers 
such competitive pressures could result in loss of customers and an incurrence of stranded costs ie  assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable as the result of competitive pricing 
to the extent stranded costs cannot be recovered from customers  they would be borne by security holders 
across the nation  approximately half of the states including illinois have passed legislation or issued regulatory rulings granting customers the right to choose their electric energy supplier 
legislation that would allow customers to choose their electric energy supplier is expected to be introduced in iowa in at the federal level  a number of proposals to restructure the electric industry are currently under consideration 
however  there continues to be a lack of consensus over how restructuring should be implemented and how much control the federal government should have over this process 
until one of the proposals gains significant bipartisan support  there is unlikely to be final federal action to either facilitate or force states to open electricity markets to competition 
alliant energy realized   and of its electric utility revenues in in iowa  wisconsin  minnesota and illinois  respectively 
approximately of the electric revenues were regulated by the respective state commissions while the other were regulated by the ferc 
alliant energy realized   and of its gas utility revenues in iowa  wisconsin  minnesota and illinois  respectively  during the same period 
iesu realized of its electric and gas utility retail revenues in in iowa 
approximately of the electric revenues in were regulated by the iub while the other were regulated by the ferc 
wp l realized of its electric utility revenues in in wisconsin and in illinois 
approximately of the electric revenues in were regulated by the pscw or the icc while the other were regulated by the ferc 
wp l realized of its gas utility revenues in in wisconsin and in illinois 
federal regulation iesu  wp l and ipc are subject to regulation by the ferc 
nepa addresses several matters designed to promote competition in the electric wholesale power generation market 
ferc has issued final rules ferc orders a and a requiring electric utilities to open their transmission lines to other wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity 
in response to ferc orders and a  corporate services  on behalf of iesu  wp l and ipc  has filed open access transmission tariffs that comply with the orders 
in response to ferc orders and a  iesu  wp l and ipc are participating in a regional open access same time information system 
ferc order permits utilities to seek recovery of legitimate  prudent and verifiable stranded costs associated with providing open access transmission services 
ferc does not have jurisdiction over retail distribution and  consequently  the final ferc rules do not provide for the recovery of stranded costs resulting from retail competition 
the various states retain jurisdiction over the question of whether to permit retail competition  the terms of such retail competition  and the recovery of any portion of stranded costs that are ultimately determined to have resulted from retail competition 
in may  ferc issued a nopr concerning the development of rtos 
the proposed rules outline the requirements for utilities to voluntarily turn over control of their transmission system to a regional entity either by leasing the system to an rto or by outright divestiture 
in december  ferc issued order which implemented the proposed rules with minor modifications 
ferc s timeline is to have the rtos in operation by the end of alliant energy is involved with other utilities and industry groups in reviewing order and has submitted a joint petition to ferc seeking further clarification of the operating and ownership limitations that will be imposed on the rtos 
alliant energy s current plans to contribute its wisconsin transmission assets to atc  in exchange for an equity interest  and participate in the midwest iso are expected to comply with the provisions of order alliant energy and the utility subsidiaries cannot predict the long term consequences of these rules on their financial condition or results of operations 
state regulation iowa iesu and ipc are subject to regulation by the iub 
the iub has been reviewing all forms of competition in the electric utility industry for several years 
a group comprised of the iub  alliant energy  midamerican energy company  rural electric cooperatives  municipal utilities and iowans for choice in electricity a diverse group of industrial customers  marketers  such as enron  and a low income customer representative  among others endorsed a bill to allow for such competition that was introduced in the iowa legislature in march the bill was opposed by the oca  which is charged by iowa law with representation of all consumers generally 
while the bill did not pass  by operation of house rules  it was re referred to the house commerce committee and was again inserted into the legislative process in the second regular session of the th general assembly 
as of march   the bill has been approved by both the iowa house and senate commerce committees and will be addressed by the legislature in full 
the bill would allow choice of electric suppliers for all customers on october  it would freeze iesu s and ipc s iowa regulated prices at january levels 
it would allow  however  for investor owned utilities to propose increases due to exogenous factors for example  environmental compliance costs in the generation cost component 
assigned service territories would be maintained for the delivery function 
delivery prices would be regulated  with the option available to propose performance based rate making 
prices for generation and other retail services would not be regulated  except for sos pricing starting october for all residential customers and non residential customers with annual usage of fewer than  kwhs 
pricing for sos would initially be at levels equivalent to prices as they exist today and would remain at such levels until at least december  for sos customers 
the iub would be able to terminate sos if it were to determine several conditions existed  including  most importantly  that effective competition existed such that regulation was no longer necessary 
if the iub continues sos past december   then prices would be based upon competitive bids 
there are no price protections for non residential customers with usage greater than  kwh annually  with the exception of transitional service 
transitional service would exist for no longer than one year  until october   at prices the iub determines to be just and reasonable 
currently existing automatic fuel adjustment clauses for recovery of fuel costs would be eliminated no later than october a nuclear only fuel adjustment would be permitted with increased prices effective if an electric company s nuclear plant is not operational due to exogenous factors 
transition or stranded cost is the difference between the revenues that would have been collected pursuant to an electric company s revenue requirement existing as of january   and market prices for the period through these differences would be afforded recovery in the first twelve months of choice  with   and in each subsequent twelve month period 
effective october   transition cost recovery would end 
in lieu of accepting this transition cost recovery mechanism  an electric utility would be entitled under the proposed legislation to elect to divest itself of its generation assets  including power supply contracts 
in such case  the utility would be given an opportunity to be made whole for recovery of embedded costs with the possibility for shareowners to retain of the amount realized from the sale of the assets beyond the sum of depreciated book value and unfunded decommissioning 
a divestiture plan would be filed with the iub no later than january   with iub approval or modification by july  the utility would have until september  to revoke its election 
costs of start up  including computer systems and employee transition costs  would be recoverable over a ten year period  as approved by the iub 
the difference between regulatory assets and liabilities would be fully recoverable as a delivery charge 
nuclear decommissioning costs would be fully recoverable 
while alliant energy supports the proposed legislation in its current form  it is unable to predict if this legislation will be enacted in  what modifications  if any  may be made to the proposed bill or what actions alliant energy may take in response to the legislation should it be enacted 
in the first quarter of  the iub conducted workshops concerning the unbundling of natural gas rates for all iowa customers as well as allowing choice of the supplier of the natural gas for the small volume natural gas customers 
iesu s and ipc s natural gas costs are a flow through cost item in that they are automatically reflected in future billings to customers 
such collections are reconciled on an annual basis to ensure that they neither over nor under collect their actual gas commodity costs 
consequently  alliant energy does not currently realize any margins or income with respect to its provision of the gas commodity 
alliant energy expects to continue to be made whole for such gas costs if the gas rates are unbundled 
even if alliant energy s gas commodity sales were to decline in a customer choice environment  its margins and income would not be expected to be impacted by such decreases in commodity sales 
the delivery function of alliant energy s gas business in iowa will likely continue to be regulated on a cost of service basis  as currently is the case 
as a result  assuming no significant change in the regulatory posture  the delivery function would continue to generate comparable margins and income to that currently generated  regardless of what entity provides the gas commodity to the customer 
on march   the iub issued an order indicating that the iub prefers to allow each utility to design a tariff in order to remove barriers to a competitive option for small volume customers 
the iub will also seek comments from the utility companies before approving any tariff filings 
wisconsin wp l is subject to regulation by the pscw 
the pscw s inquiries into the future structure of the natural gas and electric utility industries are ongoing 
the stated goal of the pscw regarding natural gas service is to accommodate competition but not create it 
the pscw has followed a measured approach to restructuring the natural gas industry in wisconsin 
the pscw has determined that customer classes will be deregulated ie  the gas utility would no longer have an obligation to procure gas commodity for customers  but would still have a delivery obligation in a step wise manner  after each class has been demonstrated to have a sufficient number of gas suppliers available 
the short term goals of the pscw s electric restructuring process are to ensure reliability of the state s electric system and development of a robust wholesale electric market 
the long term goal is to establish prerequisite safeguards to protect customers prior to allowing retail customer choice 
there are no other restructuring working groups currently active in wisconsin 
in may  the pscw reactivated docket no 
bu with the objective of examining the degree of separation which should be required as a matter of policy between utility and non utility activities involving the various state utilities 
final hearings were held in february and the pscw ruled that utilities can continue to offer non utility services to customers and affiliates and that utilities must continue to fully allocate their costs to such non utility activities 
it is anticipated that there will be legislative proposals introduced in the legislative session on issues dealing with restructuring of the electric utility industry 
it is not possible to predict at this time the scope or the possibility of enactment of such proposals 
reliability legislation was enacted in wisconsin in this legislation included  among other items  a relaxation of the non utility asset limitations included in the wuhca and the formation of a wisconsin transmission company for those wisconsin utility holding companies who elect to take advantage of the new asset cap law 
alliant energy has agreed to contribute wp l s transmission assets to the transmission company american transmission company  or atc in exchange for an equity interest in atc 
wp l made several federal and state regulatory filings and commitments in the fourth quarter of relating to its participation in atc 
atc s sole business will be to provide reliable  economic transmission service to all customers in a fair and equitable manner 
atc will plan  construct  operate  maintain and expand transmission facilities it will own to provide for adequate and reliable transmission of power 
it will provide comparable service to all customers  including alliant energy  and it will support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant 
formation of the company will require federal and state regulatory approvals 
atc will be regulated by ferc for all rate terms and conditions of service 
atc will be a transmission owning member of the midwest iso and will transfer operational control of the transmission systems to the midwest iso 
atc will be a public utility  as defined under wisconsin law  with a board of directors comprised of one representative from each utility having at least a ownership interest in atc 
smaller utilities could combine their transmission assets with others to reach the minimum level for board membership 
in addition  the shareowners of atc will select four at large directors that can not be employed or engaged in energy businesses 
the pscw has not yet determined the exact scope of the assets that must be transferred to the atc 
pending the final determination by the pscw  wp l estimates it will transfer approximately million in plant assets at net book value to the atc when it becomes operational in late alliant energy is also reviewing the possible contribution of iesu s and ipc s transmission assets to atc as well 
alliant energy estimates the net book value of such plant assets to approximate million 
while alliant energy will realize its proportionate share of atc s earnings  it is not yet known what the overall financial impact of alliant energy s participation in atc will be 
minnesota ipc is subject to regulation by the mpuc 
the mpuc established an electric competition working group in april on october   the working group issued a report and recommendations on retail competition 
the mpuc reviewed the report and directed its staff to develop an electric utility restructuring plan and timeline 
the mpuc has recently solicited comments on restructuring principles from stakeholders in the process 
it does not appear that any comprehensive restructuring legislation will be passed in the mpuc has also initiated docket e ci to investigate the appropriate classification of transmission assets in minnesota 
illinois wp l and ipc are subject to regulation by the icc 
in december  the state of illinois passed electric deregulation legislation requiring customer choice of electric suppliers for non residential customers with loads of four mw or larger and for approximately one third of all other non residential customers starting october  all remaining non residential customers will be eligible for customer choice beginning december  and all residential customers will be eligible for customer choice beginning may  the new legislation is not expected to have a significant impact on alliant energy s financial condition or results of operations given the relatively small size of alliant energy s illinois operations 
as of december   no eligible alliant energy customer had selected another electric supplier 
accounting implications each of the utilities complies with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas provides that rate regulated public utilities record certain costs and credits allowed in the rate making process in different periods than for non regulated entities 
these are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and are recognized in the consolidated statements of income at the time they are reflected in rates 
if a portion of the utility subsidiaries operations becomes no longer subject to the provisions of sfas as a result of competitive restructurings or otherwise  a write down of related regulatory assets and possibly other charges would be required  unless some form of transition cost recovery is established by the appropriate regulatory body that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets during such recovery period 
in addition  each utility subsidiary would be required to determine any impairment of other assets and write down any impaired assets to their fair value 
the utility subsidiaries believe they currently meet the requirements of sfas and will continue to monitor and assess this as the various utility industry restructuring initiatives progress 
positioning for a competitive environment alliant energy and its subsidiaries cannot currently predict the long term consequences of the competitive and restructuring issues described above on their financial condition or results of operations 
the major objective is to allow the company to compete successfully in a competitive  deregulated utility industry 
the strategy for dealing with these emerging issues includes seeking growth opportunities  forming strategic alliances with other energy related businesses  continuing to offer quality customer service  initiating ongoing cost reductions and productivity enhancements and developing new products and services 
as competitive forces shape the energy services industry  energy providers are being challenged to increase growth and profits 
because alliant energy expects consumption of electricity and natural gas to grow only modestly within alliant energy s domestic utility service territories  alliant energy has entered several energy services markets that it expects will provide opportunities for new sources of growth 
alliant energy  through its subsidiary resources  has established new distinct platforms to complement its existing non regulated investments  which are designed to meet customer needs 
these platforms and existing investments include investments resources existing investments include an oil and gas production company  a short line railroad  a barge company  an affordable housing company  various real estate joint ventures and an equity stake in an independent telecommunications provider 
international international is a partner in developing  or seeking to develop  energy generation and infrastructure in new zealand  australia  china  mexico and brazil  markets which have been selected because of their growth potential 
industrial services isco is a provider of energy and environmental services designed to maximize productivity for industrial and large commercial customers 
this platform consists of four units energy planning  energy management  energy applications  which provides facilities based and commodities based energy solutions  and rmt  inc  an environmental management and engineering firm with offices throughout the us and the united kingdom 
cargill alliant alliant energy has an energy trading joint venture with cargill that combines the risk management and commodity trading expertise of cargill with alliant energy s low cost electricity generation and transmission business experience 
cargill alliant officially began operations in and has an initial term though october the term automatically renews for successive five year periods unless either party notifies the other at least one year prior to the then expiring term 
mass markets resources is a provider of products and services designed to meet the comfort  security and productivity needs of residential and small commercial customers 
resources currently offers home appliance and furnace warranties and a variety of home energy  safety and security products through its power house catalog 
such products are marketed directly to customers  through the mail with the catalog and over the internet 
resources expects to continue pursuing opportunities in these markets  which it believes has a growth potential as industry deregulation allows more customers to choose their energy suppliers in an open market 
alliant energy believes that each of these platforms provide prospects for growth both individually and collectively as the competitive energy services marketplace evolves 
alliant energy expects that these strategies will contribute significantly to its annual earnings growth target of from its business operations 
resources is expected to contribute of such earnings within the next years 
alliant energy results of operations overview alliant energy s earnings for each of the last three years were as follows in thousands  except per share amounts net income    average number of common shares outstanding    earnings per average common share basic and diluted pre tax merger expenses   the significant increase in alliant energy s earnings compared to was due to increased earnings from non regulated operations of per share of which per share was attributable to sales of mcleod stock  higher electric and natural gas margins from utility operations and lower utility operation and maintenance expenses 
higher depreciation excluding hedge losses in wp l s nuclear decommissioning trust fund and interest expenses partially offset these items 
the results also included approximately million of pre tax merger related expenses per share 
the utility earnings were million per share compared to million per share for the increase in utility earnings resulted primarily from higher electric and natural gas margins and per share  respectively  lower operation and maintenance expenses per share and income realized from weather hedges per share 
higher depreciation excluding hedge losses in wp l s nuclear decommissioning trust fund and interest expenses and per share  respectively and a higher effective income tax rate per share partially offset these items 
the utility results included approximately per share of merger related expenses 
resources reported net income of million per share in compared to a net loss of million per share for the earnings included gains realized from several asset sales  including approximately of alliant energy s investment in mcleod per share  oil and gas properties at whiting per share and certain new zealand electric distribution investments per share 
earnings from alliant energy s electricity trading joint venture per share  improved operating results from whiting per share and improved earnings from alliant energy s other non regulated businesses per share also contributed to the increased earnings 
the results for resources also included merger related expenses per share 
the utility earnings were million compared to million for the decrease in utility earnings resulted primarily from merger related expenses  higher purchased power and transmission costs at wp l  a decrease in retail natural gas sales largely due to milder weather conditions in compared to  a million regulatory asset write off at iesu  increased expenses for year readiness efforts  higher insurance related expenses and increased depreciation expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in retail electricity sales volumes  largely due to continued economic growth within alliant energy s service territory  lower purchased power capacity costs at iesu and ipc  reduced employee benefits costs and lower costs in due to merger related operating efficiencies 
a loss incurred on the disposition of an investment in at iesu also enhanced the earnings compared to resources reported net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the increased loss in was due to merger related expenses  lower oil and gas prices at whiting  continuing expenses for new business development in international and domestic markets  higher interest expense to fund alliant energy s growth and a modest loss from alliant energy s electricity trading joint venture 
a tax benefit realized in from a donation of securities to alliant energy s charitable foundation also contributed to the lower earnings in compared to increased earnings from alliant energy s industrial services businesses as well as gains realized on asset sales partially offset these items 
electric utility operations electric margins and mwh sales for alliant energy for  and were as follows revenues and costs mwhs sold in thousands in thousands residential       commercial       industrial       total from ultimate customers       sales for resale       other    total revenues       electric production fuels expense    purchased power expense    margin    reflects the change from to reflects the change from to electric margin increased million  or  and million  or  for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to separate million annual rate adjustments implemented at wp l in july and march to recover higher purchased power and transmission costs  a favorable million change in estimate of alliant energy s utility services rendered but unbilled at month end based on refinements made to alliant energy s estimation process in and an increase in retail sales of due to more favorable weather conditions and economic growth in the service territory 
partially offsetting these increases were reduced recoveries of approximately million in concurrent and previously deferred expenditures for iowa mandated energy efficiency programs  lower sales to off system and wholesale customers  higher purchased power capacity costs in iowa and million of revenues collected from wp l customers in for a surcharge related to kewaunee 
the recovery for energy efficiency programs in iowa is in accordance with iub orders a portion of these recoveries is offset as they are also amortized to expense in other operation expense 
the lower sales to off system and wholesale customers were primarily due to lower wholesale customer contractual commitments and transmission constraints 
the increase in electric margin for was primarily due to the increased recovery of million of concurrent and previously deferred expenditures for iowa mandated energy efficiency programs  reduced purchased power capacity costs at iesu and ipc  higher sales volumes to retail customers and wp l s reliance on more costly purchased power in the first six months of due to various power plant outages  particularly kewaunee 
the increased sales volumes were primarily due to continued economic growth within the alliant energy service territory 
these increases were partially offset by a lower margin at wp l and a rate decrease implemented at ipc in the lower margin at wp l was due to the regulatory lag associated with the rate recovery of higher purchased power and transmission costs  a rate decrease implemented in and lower off system sales income 
iesu s and ipc s electric tariffs include eac s that are designed to currently recover the costs of fuel and the energy portion of purchased power billings see note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the eac 
gas utility operations gas margins and dth sales for alliant energy for  and were as follows revenues and costs dekatherms sold in thousands in thousands residential       commercial       industrial       transportation other       total revenues       cost of gas sold    margin    reflects the change from to reflects the change from to gas margin increased million  or  and decreased million  or  for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to higher retail sales due to customer growth and more favorable weather conditions in the sales increase was partially offset by decreased recoveries of million from the recovery of concurrent and previously deferred energy efficiency expenditures for iowa mandated energy efficiency program costs in accordance with iub orders a portion of these recoveries is offset as they are also amortized to expense in other operation expense 
refer to interest expense and other for a discussion of income realized from two gas weather hedges at wp l in the decrease in gas margin in was primarily due to a decrease in dth sales  largely due to milder weather  and a rate reduction implemented in april at wp l 
an increase in revenues of million from the recovery of energy efficiency expenditures in iowa and gas cost adjustments at ipc partially offset the sales decrease 
iesu s and ipc s gas tariffs include pga clauses that are designed to currently recover the cost of utility gas sold see note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the pga 
non regulated and other revenues non regulated and other revenues for  and were as follows in millions isco oil and gas whiting steam transportation other the revenues for isco increased significantly in primarily due to the second quarter acquisition of an oil gathering and transportation business in texas and increased demand for environmental and engineering services 
such increases were partially offset by reduced activity in the energy marketing business 
the revenues for isco declined significantly in compared to primarily due to decreased low margin gas marketing activities and the transfer of the electricity trading business to the cargill joint venture in july alliant energy s investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
other operating expenses other operation expenses for  and were as follows in millions utility iesu wp l ipc isco oil and gas whiting transportation other other operation expenses at the utility subsidiaries decreased million in primarily due to the nonrecurrence of million of merger related expenses incurred in  lower energy efficiency expenses of million in iowa  a write off of million of certain employee benefits related regulatory assets at iesu  decreased transmission and distribution expenses  lower operating costs at alliant energy s generating plants  reduced insurance related expenses and lower costs in due to merger related operating efficiencies 
the merger related expenses were primarily for employee retirements million  separations million and relocations million 
these decreases were partially offset by higher costs for employee incentive compensation  energy conservation expense at wp l and employee benefits 
other operation expenses at isco increased million in primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisition of the oil gathering and transportation business and the increased demand for environmental and engineering services  partially offset by lower operation expenses in the energy marketing business 
other operation expenses at isco decreased million in primarily due to the formation of the cargill joint venture 
other operation expenses at the utility subsidiaries increased million in primarily due to the merger related expenses  increased energy efficiency expenses in iowa  the regulatory asset write off at iesu  higher administrative and general expenses at wp l  higher insurance related expenses and increased expenses for year readiness efforts 
the increase was partially offset by reduced employee benefit expenses  reduced energy conservation expense at wp l  lower costs resulting from merger related operating efficiencies and reduced nuclear operation expenses at iesu 
the regulatory asset write off resulted from iesu assessing in the fourth quarter of how certain employee benefit costs were recovered in the rate making process in iowa 
based on such review  iesu concluded it could no longer meet the required probable standard for sfas the decrease in maintenance expenses was primarily due to reduced nuclear and transmission and distribution maintenance expenses 
such decreases were partially offset by increased expenses for alliant energy s year readiness program and higher expenses at alliant energy s fossil fueled generating plants 
maintenance expenses were flat in primarily due to reduced expenses at fossil fueled plants  which were virtually offset by increased maintenance at the nuclear plants 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million and increased million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to reduced earnings in wp l s nuclear decommissioning trust fund offset entirely in miscellaneous  net  lower depletion expense at whiting and the million kewaunee surcharge in at wp l recorded in depreciation and amortization expense with a corresponding increase in revenues resulting in no earnings impact 
these items were largely offset by increases in depreciation expense due to utility property additions 
the increase in was due to utility property additions and the kewaunee surcharge 
interest expense and other interest expense increased million and million in and  respectively  due to higher utility and non regulated borrowings 
also contributing to the increase was higher nuclear decommissioning trust fund interest expense at iesu  which was offset entirely in miscellaneous  net 
contributing to the increase was an adjustment to decrease interest expense in relating to a tax audit settlement at wp l 
the accounting for earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds results in no net income impact 
miscellaneous  net income increases for earnings on the nuclear decommissioning funds at both wp l and iesu 
in accordance with their respective regulatory requirements  the corresponding offset is recorded through depreciation expense at wp l and interest expense at iesu 
alliant energy sold approximately million shares  as adjusted for mcleod s for stock split in july of its investment in mcleod in  resulting in pre tax gains of approximately million 
miscellaneous  net income increased million and decreased million in and  respectively 
the increase was due to the following factors a million of merger related expenses incurred in for the services of alliant energy s advisors and costs related to alliant energy s merger related name change 
b gains of million and million realized from the sales of several oil and gas properties at whiting and certain new zealand electric distribution investments  respectively 
c a million increase in pre tax earnings from alliant energy s electricity trading joint venture 
d million of income realized from weather hedges at wp l 
refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
e these items were partially offset by a decrease of million in earnings on alliant energy s nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
the decrease in miscellaneous  net income was due to the merger related expenses and a modest loss from alliant energy s electricity trading joint venture  partially offset by gains on asset sales in the results also included a loss incurred on the disposition of an investment at iesu

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the changes 
iesu results of operations overview iesu s earnings available for common stock increased million and million in and  respectively 
the increased earnings for were primarily due to million of merger related expenses in  a million regulatory asset write off in  a change in estimate of iesu s unbilled revenues and reduced maintenance expenses 
such increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense  increased administrative and general expenses and a higher effective income tax rate 
the increased earnings for were primarily due to a increase in retail electric sales volumes  largely due to continued economic growth in iesu s service territory  lower purchased power capacity costs  reduced employee benefits costs and lower costs in due to merger related operating efficiencies 
a loss incurred on the disposition of an investment in also improved earnings compared to partially offsetting the higher earnings were merger related expenses  the regulatory asset write off described above  decreased retail natural gas sales resulting from milder weather  increased depreciation and amortization expenses and increased expenses for year readiness efforts

the decrease was primarily due to reduced recoveries of approximately million in concurrent and previously deferred expenditures for iowa mandated energy efficiency programs and increased purchased power capacity costs 
the recovery for energy efficiency programs in iowa is in accordance with iub orders a portion of these recoveries is offset as they are also amortized to expense in other operation expense 
sales for resale decreased significantly in primarily due to various resale customers of iesu selecting another utility as their electricity provider effective in early the loss of such customers has not had a material impact on iesu s electric margins 
sales to retail customers increased primarily due to continued economic growth in iesu s service territory and more favorable weather conditions 
the electric margin also benefited from a favorable million change in estimate of iesu s utility services rendered but unbilled at month end based on refinements made to iesu s estimation process in the increase was primarily due to the increased recovery of approximately million of concurrent and previously deferred expenditures for iowa mandated energy efficiency programs  increases in sales volumes to retail customers due to economic growth in the service territory and reduced purchased power capacity costs 
sales for resale increased significantly for as a result of the implementation of a merger related joint sales agreement during the second quarter of off system sales revenues are passed through iesu s energy adjustment clause and therefore have no impact on electric margin

other operating expenses iesu s other operation expenses decreased million and increased million for and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to million of merger related expenses in  a million regulatory asset write off in  a million decrease in energy efficiency expenses and merger related operating efficiencies realized in the merger related expenses were primarily for employee retirements  separations and relocations 
the regulatory asset write off resulted from iesu assessing in the fourth quarter of how certain employee benefit costs were recovered in the rate making process in iowa 
based on such review  iesu concluded it could no longer meet the required probable standard for sfas such decreases were partially offset by increased costs for employee incentive compensation and higher employee benefit costs 
the increase was primarily due to higher merger related expenses  increased energy efficiency expenses  the regulatory asset write off mentioned above and increased year readiness costs 
these items were partially offset by lower nuclear operation expenses  reduced employee pension and benefit costs and lower costs resulting from merger related operating efficiencies 
maintenance expenses decreased million and million in and  respectively

the increased earnings for were primarily due to million of merger related expenses in  higher electric and natural gas margins  reduced other operation and maintenance expenses and income realized from weather hedges 
such increases were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense excluding hedge losses in wp l s nuclear decommissioning trust fund and higher interest expense 
the decreased earnings for were primarily due to merger related expenses  higher purchased power and transmission costs  higher depreciation and amortization expenses  decreased retail natural gas sales largely due to milder weather  higher insurance related expenses  higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate

cash flows from operating activities at iesu decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in  primarily due to changes in working capital 
cash flows used for financing activities increased million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in  due to increased common stock dividends in as no dividend payments were made in the last three quarters of due to merger related tax considerations 
as a result  the dividend payment in the first quarter of was larger than iesu s historical quarterly payment

future considerations the capital requirements of alliant energy are primarily attributable to its utility subsidiaries construction and acquisition programs  its debt maturities and business opportunities of resources 
it is anticipated that future capital requirements of alliant energy will be met by cash generated from operations  sale of investments and external financing 
the level of cash generated from operations is partially dependent upon economic conditions  legislative activities  environmental matters and timely regulatory recovery of utility costs 
alliant energy s liquidity and capital resources will be affected by costs associated with environmental and regulatory issues 
emerging competition in the utility industry could also impact alliant energy s liquidity and capital resources  as discussed previously in the utility industry outlook section 
alliant energy had certain off balance sheet financial guarantees and commitments outstanding at december  they generally consist of third party borrowing arrangements and lending commitments  guarantees of financial performance of syndicated affordable housing properties and guarantees relating to alliant energy s electricity trading joint venture 
refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
under puhca  certain investments of alliant energy in exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies are limited to of alliant energy s consolidated retained earnings 
alliant energy is pursuing making the necessary regulatory filings requesting an increase in this limitation 
under wuhca  there historically was an asset cap provision that had generally limited non utility assets in a utility holding company to of utility assets 
this provision limited alliant energy s ability to make additional investments in its non utility businesses 
the reliability legislation that was enacted in wisconsin in provides wisconsin utility holding companies significant asset cap relief once they meet certain conditions relating to the formation of a transmission company  as discussed in the utility industry outlook section 
alliant energy believes it has met all such conditions and is now operating under the new law 
under the provisions of the new law  assets related to the provision of various energy related  environmental engineering and telecommunications services are no longer included in the calculation of either utility or non utility assets 
alliant energy expects to pursue various potential business development opportunities  including international as well as domestic investments  and is devoting resources to such efforts 
foreign investments may carry a higher level of risk than alliant energy s traditional domestic utility investments or resources domestic investments 
such risks could include foreign government actions  foreign economic and currency risks and others 
it is anticipated that alliant energy will strive to select investments where the international and other risks are both understood and manageable 
at december   resources had approximately million of investments in foreign entities 
at december   iesu  wp l and ipc did not have any foreign investments 
on february   resources completed a private placement of exchangeable senior notes due  which were issued in the original aggregate principal amount of million 
the exchangeable senior notes have an interest rate of through february  and thereafter 
the exchangeable senior notes are exchangeable for cash based upon a percentage of the value of mcleod class a common stock 
alliant energy has agreed to fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the exchangeable senior notes 
the proceeds will be used to repay commercial paper issued to capitalize resources wholly owned exempt telecommunications company and  indirectly through an internal transfer of assets  to assist in funding the recent investment in brazil  as well as for general corporate purposes 
the exchangeable senior notes may have certain accounting consequences for alliant energy that may affect reported earnings 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  alliant energy records its investment in mcleod stock at its fair value  with changes in fair value  net of income tax effects  recorded directly to the common equity section of the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any such changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings only at the time they are actually realized through a sale 
however  applicable accounting rules require alliant energy to record in its consolidated statements of income any increase or decrease in the settlement value ie  the amount payable upon maturity of the exchangeable senior notes that results from changes in the market value of mcleod stock 
the settlement value of the exchangeable senior notes at any point in time is generally assuming no deferrals of interest payments the higher of a the original principal amount plus accrued interest less cash dividends or other distributions on the mcleod stock  or b the current market value of the shares of mcleod stock attributable to the exchangeable senior notes 
accordingly  any increase or decrease in the settlement value of the exchangeable senior notes will be recorded as subtractions from  or additions to  alliant energy s reported net income 
the market price of the mcleod stock has been volatile and has fluctuated over a wide range since the initial public offering 
a significant increase in the market value of mcleod stock would significantly decrease alliant energy s reported net income 
similarly  a significant decrease in the market value of mcleod stock would significantly increase alliant energy s reported net income  subject to the condition that the settlement value of the exchangeable senior notes will not be reduced below the original principal amount plus accrued interest less cash dividends or other distributions on the mcleod stock 
these increases and decreases in reported investment income in alliant energy s consolidated statements of income will be non cash in nature and will be reflected on alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets as increases and decreases in long term debt 
alliant energy would recognize a non cash charge to net income of approximately million for each share increase in mcleod s stock price above share as relates to the million shares of mcleod stock attributable to the exchangeable senior notes 
this impact on earnings will be mitigated somewhat once alliant energy adopts sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as discussed further below 
alliant energy may choose to adopt sfas early 
see other matters accounting pronouncements for additional information relating to sfas sfas will require alliant energy to split the value of the exchangeable senior notes into a debt component and a derivative component 
any changes in the fair value of the derivative component subsequent to the sfas adoption date will be reflected as an increase or decrease in alliant energy s reported net income 
at the date of initial adoption  sfas provides alliant energy a one time ability to transfer any of alliant energy s available for sale securities  including a portion of its shares of mcleod stock  to the trading category 
at the date of any such transfer from available for sale to trading  alliant energy would recognize in income the appreciation in the shares transferred 
although alliant energy is not required to hold a number of shares of mcleod stock equal to the number of exchangeable senior notes outstanding  if alliant energy does so and if alliant energy elects to make this transfer from available for sale to trading  changes subsequent to the sfas adoption date in the fair value of the shares of mcleod stock so transferred will be reflected as an increase or decrease in alliant energy s reported net income 
changes in the market value of the mcleod stock are expected to at least partially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the exchangeable senior notes  however  there may be periods with significant non cash increases or decreases to alliant energy s net income pertaining to the exchangeable senior notes and the related shares of mcleod stock 
on january   resources acquired a stake in four brazilian electric utilities serving more than  customers for a total investment of approximately million 
as part of this investment  resources acquired a ownership interest in companhia forca e luz cataguazes leopoldina cataguazes  an electric utility 
cataguazes owns a majority stake in cenf  another electric utility company  as well as a majority interest in energisa sa  an energy development company 
as part of the same investment  resources directly acquired a interest in energisa sa itself  which holds majority stakes in two regulated utilities energipe and celb 
as part owner of cataguazes  resources will hold both indirect and direct interests in energisa sa the investment is anticipated to dilute alliant energy s earnings per share by approximately in  with positive contributions to earnings expected in subsequent years 
resources  through its wholly owned subsidiary  international  initially financed the brazil investment with cash made available through the internal transfer of existing non regulated corporate assets 
resources has entered into a shareholders agreement with the brazilian companies  which would allow it to name two directors to the boards of each company and its subsidiaries 
the agreement will also provide resources with a role in selecting each company s management team  along with voting rights relating to critical issues at the brazilian companies and their subsidiaries 
the investment will be accounted for under the equity method 
alliant energy entered into an agreement in november  as amended  with mcleod whereby alliant energy s ability to sell the mcleod stock is subject to various restrictions 
the agreement provides that until december   alliant energy and its affiliates generally may not sell or otherwise dispose of shares of mcleod stock beneficially owned by alliant energy and its affiliates  other than to a subsidiary of alliant energy  without the prior written consent of the board of directors of mcleod 
however  the amended agreement provides that the board of directors of mcleod may permit alliant energy and its affiliates to sell a specified number of shares of mcleod stock per quarter during specified time periods 
in addition  if alliant energy and its affiliates are not provided the opportunity to sell  on an annual basis  an aggregate number of shares of mcleod stock equal to of the shares of mcleod stock owned by alliant energy and its affiliates as of december   then alliant energy may terminate the amended november agreement 
in the first quarter of  the alliant energy board of directors approved a draft agreement and plan of merger to merge iesu and ipc 
the new company will be named interstate power and light company and it is anticipated the merger will be completed by late or early alliant energy expects to be able to achieve cost savings and enhanced customer service from the merger 
financing and capital structure access to the long term and short term capital and credit markets  and costs of external financing  are dependent on creditworthiness 
the debt ratings of alliant energy and certain subsidiaries by moody s and standard poor s are as follows moody s standard poor s iesu secured long term debt a a unsecured long term debt a a wp l secured long term debt aa aa unsecured long term debt aa a ipc secured long term debt a a resources commercial paper a p a unsecured long term debt a a a alliant energy commercial paper b p a a resources debt is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alliant energy 
b iesu  wp l and ipc participate in a utility money pool that is funded  as needed  through the issuance of commercial paper by alliant energy 
interest expense and other fees are allocated based on borrowing amounts 
the pscw has restricted wp l from lending money to non utility affiliates and non wisconsin utilities 
as a result  wp l is prohibited from lending money to the utility money pool but is able to borrow money from the utility money pool 
on november   resources issued million of senior notes due in a private placement 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alliant energy 
the net proceeds from the debt offering have been used to repay outstanding commercial paper  as it becomes due  that has been backed by resources year credit agreement 
other than periodic sinking fund requirements  which will not require additional cash expenditures  the following long term debt in millions will mature prior to december  iesu wp l alliant energy parent resources ipc total depending upon market conditions  it is currently anticipated that a majority of the maturing debt will be refinanced with the issuance of long term securities 
on august   wp l filed an application with the pscw for authority to issue up to million of debentures for the purpose of refinancing existing debt 
approval was granted in february and the senior unsecured debentures were issued in march at a fixed interest rate of  due the amount of short term borrowings authorized by the pscw will be reduced by the same million 
on november   iesu and ipc received authority from the sec under puhca to issue million and million of long term debt securities  respectively 
the companies continually evaluate their future financing needs and will make any necessary regulatory filings as needed 
the various charter provisions of the entities identified below authorize and limit the aggregate amount of additional shares of cumulative preferred stock and cumulative preference stock that may be issued 
at december   the companies could have issued the following additional shares of cumulative preferred or preference stock iesu wp l ipc cumulative preferred    cumulative preference   for interim financing  iesu  wp l and ipc were authorized by the applicable federal or state regulatory agency to issue short term debt at december  as follows in millions iesu wp l ipc regulatory authorization short term debt outstanding money pool at december   there was no short term debt outstanding with external parties at the utility subsidiaries 
in addition to the million of commercial paper alliant energy issued to fund the utility money pool and million of commercial paper at resources  alliant energy had an additional million of short term debt outstanding at december  in addition to providing for ongoing working capital needs  this availability of short term financing provides the companies flexibility in the issuance of long term securities 
the level of short term borrowing fluctuates based on seasonal corporate needs  the timing of long term financing and capital market conditions 
to maintain flexibility in its capital structure and to take advantage of favorable short term rates  iesu and wp l also use proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to finance a portion of their long term cash needs 
alliant energy anticipates that short term debt will continue to be available at reasonable costs due to current ratings by independent utility analysts and credit rating services 
in december  alliant energy  iesu  wp l and ipc filed an application with the sec for approval of a combined accounts receivable program whereby each utility will sell their respective receivables through wholly owned special purpose entities to an affiliated financing entity  which in turn will sell the receivables to an outside investor 
the new program would replace the existing programs for iesu and wp l  and would function the same in most respects 
approvals from the sec and the necessary state commissions are expected in the second quarter of resources is a party to a revolving year credit agreement with various banking institutions 
the agreement extends through october  with one year extensions available upon agreement by the parties 
unused borrowing availability under this agreement is also used to support resources commercial paper program 
a combined maximum of million of borrowings under this agreement and the commercial paper program may be outstanding at any one time 
interest rates and maturities are set at the time of borrowing 
the rates are based upon quoted market prices and the maturities are less than one year 
at december   resources had million of commercial paper outstanding and backed by its year credit agreement with discount rates ranging from 
resources intends to continue issuing commercial paper backed by this facility  and no conditions existed at december   that would prevent the issuance of commercial paper or direct borrowings on its bank lines 
as a result  alliant energy had been classifying this debt as long term 
however  since this agreement expires in october  beginning in october this debt including commercial paper backed by this facility was classified as short term 
in october  resources extended its revolving day credit agreement with various banking institutions through october the unborrowed portion of this agreement is also used to support resources commercial paper program 
a combined maximum of million of borrowings under this agreement and commercial paper backed by this facility may be outstanding at any one time 
interest rates and maturities are set at the time of borrowing 
the rates are based upon quoted market prices and the maturities are less than one year 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  and no conditions existed that would prevent the issuance of commercial paper or direct borrowings under this agreement 
in addition to the aforementioned borrowing capability under resources credit agreements  alliant energy has million of committed bank lines of credit  of which none was utilized at december   available for direct borrowing or to support commercial paper 
commitment fees are paid to maintain these lines and there are no conditions which restrict the unused lines of credit 
from time to time  alliant energy may borrow from banks and other financial institutions on uncommitted as offered credit lines in lieu of commercial paper  and has agreements with several financial institutions for such borrowings 
there are no commitment fees associated with these agreements and there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements at december  alliant energy made a filing with the sec in february under puhca to provide alliant energy with  among other things  broad authorization over the next three years to issue stock and debt  provide guarantees  acquire energy related assets and enter into interest rate hedging transactions 
approval of the filing was received from the sec in august given the above financing flexibility  including alliant energy s access to both the debt and equity securities markets  management believes it has the necessary financing capabilities in place to adequately finance its capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
capital requirements general capital expenditure and investment and financing plans are subject to continual review and change 
the capital expenditure and investment programs may be revised significantly as a result of many considerations  including changes in economic conditions  variations in actual sales and load growth compared to forecasts  requirements of environmental  nuclear and other regulatory authorities  acquisition and business combination opportunities  the availability of alternate energy and purchased power sources  the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief  escalations in construction costs and conservation and energy efficiency programs 
construction and acquisition expenditures for alliant energy for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
alliant energy s anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million  consisting of approximately million for energy related international investments  million in its utility operations and million for new business development initiatives at resources 
the significant increase in construction and acquisition expenditures in international investments relates to resources recent investment in brazil 
see liquidity and capital resources future considerations for information relating to the brazil investment 
alliant energy s anticipated utility construction and acquisition expenditures for is made up of for electric transmission and distribution  for electric generation  for information technology and for miscellaneous electric  gas  water and steam projects 
the level of domestic and international investments could vary significantly from the estimates noted here depending on actual investment opportunities  timing of the opportunities and the receipt of regulatory approvals to exceed limitations in place under puhca 
it is expected that alliant energy will spend approximately billion on utility construction and acquisition expenditures during  including expenditures to comply with nox emissions reductions in wisconsin as discussed in other matters environmental 
it is expected that resources will invest in energy products and services in domestic and international markets  industrial services initiatives and other strategic initiatives during iesu s construction and acquisition expenditures for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
iesu s anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million  of which is for electric transmission and distribution  for electric generation  for information technology and the remaining represents miscellaneous electric  gas  steam and general expenditures 
iesu s levels of utility construction and acquisition expenditures are projected to be million in  million in  million in and million in wp l s construction and acquisition expenditures for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively

wp l s construction and acquisition expenditures are projected to be million in  million in  million in and million in  which include expenditures to comply with nox emissions reductions as discussed in other matters environmental 
alliant energy anticipates financing utility construction expenditures during through internally generated funds supplemented  when required  by outside financing 
funding of resources construction and acquisition expenditures over that same period of time is expected to be completed with a combination of external financings  sales of investments and internally generated funds 
nuclear facilities alliant energy owns interests in two nuclear facilities  kewaunee and daec 
kewaunee  a mw pressurized water reactor plant  is operated by wpsc and is jointly owned by wpsc  wp l  and mg e 
the kewaunee operating license expires in daec  a mw boiling water reactor plant  is operated by iesu which has a ownership interest in the plant 
the daec operating license expires in on april   the pscw approved wpsc s application for replacement of the two steam generators at kewaunee 
the total cost of replacing the steam generators will be approximately million  with wp l s share of the cost being approximately million 
the replacement work originally planned for the spring of is now scheduled for the fall of and will take approximately days 
the delay is attributable to the inability of the steam generator manufacturer to meet the spring delivery schedule 
delays in meeting the delivery schedule did not allow for steam generator replacement to occur prior to the start of the summer weather in therefore  the decision was made to store the steam generators after they are received and wait until the next scheduled refueling outage in the fall of it is anticipated that the delay will not adversely impact the reliability of kewaunee in the interim 
plans to shutdown the plant for a spring refueling remain unchanged 
on july   the pscw approved an agreement between the owners of kewaunee which provides for wpsc to assume the kewaunee ownership share currently held by mg e prior to work beginning on the replacement of steam generators 
on september   wpsc and mg e finalized an arrangement in which wpsc will acquire mg e s share of kewaunee 
this agreement  the closing of which is contingent upon regulatory approval and the steam generator replacement in the fall of  will give wpsc ownership in kewaunee 
after the change in ownership  wpsc and wp l will be responsible for the decommissioning of the plant 
wpsc and wp l are discussing revisions to the joint power supply agreement which will govern operation of the plant after the ownership change takes place 
prior to the july  pscw decision  the pscw had directed the owners of kewaunee to record depreciation and decommissioning cost levels based on an expected plant end of life of versus a license end of life of this was prompted by the uncertainty regarding the expected useful life of the plant without steam generator replacement 
this level of depreciation will remain in effect until the steam generator replacement is completed at which time the entire plant will be depreciated over years using an accelerated method 
in february  alliant energy  nsp  wpsc and wepco announced the formation of the nmc to sustain long term safety  optimize reliability and improve the operational performance of their nuclear generating plants 
combined  the nmc members operate seven nuclear generating units at five plants 
in october  alliant energy received approval from the sec  under puhca  to form alliant energy nuclear llc  whose purpose is solely to invest in the nmc 
such investment has been made and alliant energy nuclear llc now has a ownership interest in the nmc 
in november  the nmc members applied to the nrc to allow the nmc to operate the plants owned or co owned by the four utilities 
applications to the pscw  mpuc and the sec to allow the purchase of operating services were also made at that time 
these approvals are required if the applicable utilities choose to transfer their operating license to  and take operating services from  the nmc 
as presently proposed  the nmc would operate the plants  but the utilities would continue to own their plants  be entitled to energy generated at the plants and retain the financial obligations for the safe operation  maintenance and decommissioning of the plants

rates and regulatory matters ferc in november  as part of its merger approval  ferc accepted a proposal by iesu  wp l  and ipc  which provides for a four year freeze on wholesale electric prices beginning with the effective date of the merger 
in association with the merger  iesu  wp l and ipc entered into a system coordination and operating agreement which became effective with the consummation of the merger 
the agreement  which has been approved by the ferc  provides a contractual basis for coordinated planning  construction  operation and maintenance of the interconnected electric generation and transmission systems of the three utility companies 
in addition  the agreement allows the interconnected system to be operated as a single control area with off system capacity sales and purchases made to market excess system capability or to meet system capability deficiencies 
such sales and purchases are allocated among the three utility companies based on procedures included in the agreement 
the procedures were approved by both the ferc and all state regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over these sales 
iesu in september  iesu agreed with the iub to provide iowa customers a four year retail electric and gas price freeze commencing on the effective date of the merger 
the agreement excluded price changes due to government mandated programs such as energy efficiency cost recovery  the electric fuel adjustment clause and pga clause and unforeseen dramatic changes in operations 
in addition  the price freeze does not preclude a review by either the iub or oca into whether iesu is exceeding a reasonable return on common equity 
refer to the utility industry outlook section for a discussion of legislation introduced in iowa regarding restructuring the electric utility industry 
in the first quarter of  the oca requested certain financial information related to the electric utility operations within the state of iowa for iesu 
iesu is in the process of preparing responses to the data requests 
while iesu cannot predict the outcome of this process  such data requests could lead to an effort by the oca to seek an electric rate reduction for iesu in iowa 
iesu has received similar requests from the oca in the past 
under provisions of the iub rules  iesu is currently recovering the costs it has incurred for its energy efficiency programs 
generally  the costs incurred through july are being recovered over various four year periods 
statutory changes implemented by the iub in allowed iesu to begin concurrent recovery of its prospective expenditures on august  the implementation of these changes will gradually eliminate the regulatory asset that was created under the prior rate making mechanism as these costs are recovered 
wp l in connection with its approval of the merger  the pscw accepted a wp l proposal to freeze rates for four years commencing on the effective date of the merger 
a re opening of an investigation into wp l s rates during the rate freeze period  for both cost increases and decreases  may occur only for single events that are not merger related and have a revenue requirement impact of million or more 
in addition  the electric fuel adjustment clause and pga clause are not affected by the rate freezes 
in february  the pscw issued an order allowing wp l to defer certain incremental costs it incurs after february  relating to the development of the atc 
the retail electric rates are based in part on forecasted fuel and purchased power costs 
under pscw rules  wisconsin utilities can seek emergency rate increases if the annual costs are more than higher than the estimated costs used to establish rates 
in march  wp l requested an electric rate increase to cover purchased power and transmission costs that had increased due to transmission constraints and electric reliability concerns in the midwest 
effective july   the pscw granted a retail electric rate increase of million annually 
in november  wp l requested an electric rate increase to cover additional increases in purchased power and transmission costs 
in early march  the pscw granted a retail electric rate increase of million annually 
if wp l s earnings exceed its authorized return on equity  the incremental revenues collected causing the excessive return are subject to refund 
in december  wp l requested a million retail electric rate increase to reflect higher purchased power costs and to cover transmission costs that have increased due to transmission constraints 
while the most current request is still pending  wp l anticipates receiving an order in the second quarter of in may  the pscw approved the deferral by wp l of certain costs associated with its year program 
in november  wp l filed for rate recovery of the wisconsin retail portion of its year costs 
in accordance with the order received from the pscw  wp l began deferring its year project costs  other than internal labor and associated overheads 
in november  the pscw allowed wp l rate recovery of million of its year program expenditures  but it denied rate recovery of the first million 
these costs were expensed in the pscw s decision has been appealed by certain intervenors in dane county district court and such appeal is pending 
in january  wp l made a filing with the pscw proposing to begin deferring  on january   all costs associated with the epa s required nox emission reductions 
in connection with a statewide docket to investigate compliance issues associated with the epa s nox emission reductions  on march   the pscw authorized deferral of all non labor related costs incurred after march  however  the utilities are not allowed to defer costs of replacement power associated with nox compliance 
wp l requested expedited approval to start construction of nox reduction investments at several generating units operated by wp l and in the third quarter of received approval from the pscw for limited nox related expenditures at one of its generating units 
wp l has also requested recovery of all the nox reduction costs through a surcharge mechanism 
in march  the pscw issued an order approving wp l s nox compliance plans and granted the recovery of costs incurred to comply with epa nox regulations over ten years using a straight line depreciation method 
recovery of such costs will begin with rate changes after the rate freeze expires 
the depreciation lives will be reviewed every two years 
refer to the other matters environmental section for a further discussion of the nox issue 
in rate order ur  the pscw approved new rates effective april  on average  wp l s retail electric rates under the new rate order declined by and retail gas rates declined by 
refer to capital requirements nuclear facilities for a discussion of several pscw rulings regarding kewaunee 
ipc in september  ipc agreed with the iub to provide iowa customers a four year retail electric and gas price freeze commencing on the effective date of the merger 
the agreement excluded price changes due to government mandated programs such as energy efficiency cost recovery  the electric fuel adjustment clause and pga clause and unforeseen dramatic changes in operations 
in addition  the price freeze does not preclude a review by either the iub or oca into whether ipc is exceeding a reasonable return on common equity 
ipc also agreed with the mpuc and icc to four year and three year rate freezes  respectively  commencing on the effective date of the merger 
refer to the utility industry outlook section for a discussion of legislation introduced in iowa regarding restructuring the electric utility industry 
ipc is also recovering its energy efficiency costs in iowa in a similar manner as iesu and began its concurrent cost recovery in october assuming capture of the merger related synergies and no significant legislative or regulatory changes negatively affecting its utility subsidiaries  alliant energy does not expect the merger related electric and gas price freezes to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
other matters year alliant energy had no significant embedded equipment  computer system or other malfunctions during the critical december  to january  date rollover or the february  to february  date rollover 
alliant energy will continue to monitor for any supply chain issues into the second quarter of alliant energy s historical year project expenditures were as follows incremental costs  in millions description total iesu wp l other costs incurred from costs incurred from total in addition  alliant energy estimates it incurred million and million in and  respectively  of costs for internal labor and associated overheads 
alliant energy does not expect to incur any significant incremental costs in on its year readiness program 
refer to liquidity and capital resources rates and regulatory matters for a discussion of the filing wp l made with the pscw for rate recovery of a portion of its year program costs 
labor issues the status of the collective bargaining agreements at each of the utilities at december  was as follows iesu wp l ipc number of collective bargaining agreements percentage of workforce covered by agreements the collective bargaining agreements at alliant energy cover approximately of all alliant energy employees 
in  eight agreements expired and four of these agreements have been ratified and four are still being negotiated three at ipc and one at iesu 
the agreements still being negotiated have been extended and represent of employees covered under bargaining agreements and of total alliant energy employees 
in  two contracts expire representing approximately of employees covered under bargaining agreements and less than of total alliant energy employees 
alliant energy has not experienced any significant work stoppage problems in the past 
while negotiations are continuing  alliant energy is currently unable to predict the outcome of these negotiations 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s primary market risk exposures are associated with interest rates  commodity prices  equity prices and currency exchange rates 
alliant energy has risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and uses derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
interest rate risk alliant energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable rate debt 
alliant energy manages its interest rate risk by limiting its variable interest rate exposure and by continuously monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
alliant energy has also historically used interest rate swap and interest rate forward agreements to assist in the management of its interest exposure 
if variable interest rates were to average higher lower in than in  interest expense and pre tax earnings would increase decrease by approximately million 
comparatively  if variable interest rates had averaged higher lower in than in  interest expense and pre tax earnings would have increased decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates on the variable rate debt and related derivative instruments held by alliant energy as of december  and in the event of significant interest rate fluctuations  management would take actions to minimize the effect of such changes on alliant energy s results of operations 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in alliant energy s financial structure 
commodity risk non trading alliant energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas and oil products it markets 
alliant energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives 
alliant energy s exposure to commodity price risks in its utility business is significantly mitigated by the current rate making structures in place for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
refer to note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
from time to time  wp l utilizes gas commodity swap arrangements for the purpose of mitigating the impact of price fluctuations on gas purchased and injected into storage during the summer months and withdrawn and sold at current prices during the winter months 
the gas commodity swaps in place approximate the forecasted storage withdrawal plan during this period 
therefore  market price fluctuations that result in an increase or decrease in the value of the physical commodity are offset by changes in the value of the gas commodity swaps 
a increase decrease in the price of gas would have an insignificant impact on the combined fair market value of the gas in storage and related swap arrangements in place as of december  and whiting is exposed to market risk in the pricing of its oil and gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile because of seasonal weather patterns  supply and demand factors  transportation availability and price  and general economic conditions 
worldwide political developments have historically also had an impact on oil prices 
periodically  alliant energy utilizes oil and gas swaps and forward contracts to mitigate the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
based on whiting s estimated gas and crude oil sales in  and the swaps and forward contracts in place at december   a increase decrease in gas and crude oil prices for that period would impact alliant energy s pre tax earnings by approximately million 
a increase decrease in prices during would have impacted alliant energy s pre tax earnings by approximately million as relates to the commodity derivative instruments outstanding during commodity risk trading alliant energy is exposed to market risks through its electricity commodity trading business  which is primarily conducted through alliant energy s joint venture with cargill 
the joint venture s trading activities principally consist of marketing and trading over the counter forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
the majority of the forward contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell electricity at fixed prices in the future and require settlement by physical delivery of electricity or are netted out in accordance with industry trading standards 
the market prices used to determine fair values reflect the joint ventures best estimate considering various factors  including closing exchanges and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors 
the joint venture manages the market risks inherent in its trading activities through established trading and risk management policies and tools 
the principal tool utilized is a one day variance covariance value at risk model with assessment adjustments made based on weather  transmission availability  generation outages and other factors 
the estimated one day market value at risk var for the joint venture as of december  and was million and million  respectively  which were calculated with a confidence level 
the low  average and high var in were million  million and million  respectively 
equity price risk alliant energy maintains trust funds at iesu and wp l to fund its anticipated nuclear decommissioning costs 
as of december  and  these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity and debt instruments 
wp l has entered into an equity collar that uses options to mitigate the effect of significant market fluctuations on its common stock investments 
alliant energy s exposure to fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates will not affect its consolidated results of operations as such fluctuations are recorded in equally offsetting amounts of investment income and depreciation wp l or interest iesu expense when they are realized 
at december  and  alliant energy had an investment in the stock of mcleod  a publicly traded telecommunications company  valued at  million and million  respectively 
a increase decrease in the quoted market price at december would have increased decreased the value of the investment at december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of how alliant energy accounts for its investment in mcleod 
at december  and  alliant energy had various investments  accounted for under the cost method of accounting  in publicly traded utility companies in new zealand and australia which were valued at million and million  respectively 
a increase decrease in the quoted market prices at december would have increased decreased the value of the investment at december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
currency risk alliant energy has investments in various countries where the net investments are not hedged  including australia  brazil  china  new zealand  and singapore 
as a result  these investments are subject to currency exchange risk with fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
at december  and  alliant energy had a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of million and million  respectively  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on its consolidated balance sheets that primarily related to decreases in value of the new zealand dollar in relation to the us dollar 
based on alliant energy s investments at december  and  a sustained increase decrease over the next twelve months in the foreign exchange rates of australia  brazil  china  new zealand and singapore would decrease increase the cumulative foreign currency translation loss by million and million  respectively 
refer to notes n and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of alliant energy s derivative financial instruments 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired or substantively modified after december  effective dates noted are as amended by sfas 
alliant energy has organized a cross functional project team to assist in implementing sfas the team consists of both alliant energy employees and a consultant that has been engaged to support the project 
the team has begun to inventory financial instruments  commodity contracts and other commitments with the purpose of identifying and assessing all of alliant energy s derivatives 
although the impact of implementing sfas has not yet been quantified  it could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
alliant energy is analyzing various alternatives relating to the possible early adoption of sfas in sfas may only be adopted on the first day of any quarter prior to the required adoption date 
accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets the staff of the sec has questioned certain of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry  including iesu and wp l  regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in financial statements of electric utilities 
in response to these questions  the fasb has a project on its agenda to review the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets  including decommissioning of nuclear power plants 
if current electric utility industry accounting practices for nuclear power plant decommissioning are changed  the annual provision for decommissioning could increase relative to  and the estimated cost for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation  with recognition of an increase in the cost of the related nuclear power plant 
assuming no significant change in regulatory treatment  iesu and wp l do not believe that such changes  if required  would have an adverse effect on their financial condition or results of operations due to their ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates 
inflation alliant energy  iesu and wp l do not expect the effects of inflation at current levels to have a significant effect on their financial condition or results of operations 
environmental the pollution abatement programs of iesu  wp l  ipc and resources are subject to continuing review and are revised from time to time due to changes in environmental regulations  changes in construction plans and escalation of construction costs 
while management cannot precisely forecast the effect of future environmental regulations on alliant energy s operations  it has taken steps to anticipate the future while also meeting the requirements of current environmental regulations 
the clean air act amendments of act require emission reductions of so  nox and other air pollutants to achieve reductions of atmospheric chemicals believed to cause acid rain 
iesu  wp l and ipc have met the provisions of phase i of the act and phase ii of the act 
the act also governs so allowances  which are defined as an authorization for an owner to emit one ton of so into the atmosphere 
iesu  wp l and ipc are reviewing their options to ensure they will have sufficient allowances to offset their emissions in the future and believe that the potential costs of complying with these provisions of title iv of the act will not have a material adverse impact on their financial condition or results of operations 
the act and other federal laws also require the epa to study and regulate  if necessary  additional issues that potentially affect the electric utility industry  including emissions relating to ozone transport  mercury and particulate control as well as modifications to the pcb rules 
in july  the epa issued final rules that would tighten the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter emissions and in june  the epa modified the pcb rules 
alliant energy cannot predict the long term consequences of these rules on its financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the epa issued a final rule requiring states  including wisconsin  to modify their state implementation plans to address the ozone transport issue 
however  on may   a federal appeals court delayed indefinitely the implementation of the rule 
on march   the federal appeals court affirmed epa s nox rule for the affected states 
however  the court found that the epa had failed to explain how wisconsin contributes significantly to non attainment in any other state thus it has vacated the rule as relates to wisconsin 
given the epa could still appeal this decision  and alliant energy is still reviewing the recent court order  alliant energy is unable to predict the final outcome of this issue 
the implementation of the rule would likely require wp l to reduce its nox emissions at all of its plants to a fleet average of 
lbs mmbtu by wp l is following this issue closely and continues to evaluate various options to meet the emission levels 
based on existing technology  the preliminary estimates indicate that capital investments would be in the range of million to million 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources rates and regulatory matters section for a discussion of a filing wp l made with the pscw regarding seeking rate recovery of these costs 
revisions to the wisconsin administrative code have been proposed that could have a significant impact on wp l s operation of the rock river generating station in beloit  wisconsin 
the proposed revisions will affect the amount of heat that the generating station can discharge into the rock river 
wp l cannot presently predict the final outcome of the rule  but believes that  as the rule is currently proposed  the capital investments and or modifications required to meet the proposed discharge limits could be significant 
on february   the epa issued the final report to congress on the study of hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric utility steam generating units regarding hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric utilities the haps report 
the haps report concluded that mercury emissions from coal fired generating plants were a concern 
however  the epa does not believe it has sufficient information regarding such emissions 
to remedy this lack of information  the epa required iesu  wp l  ipc and all other applicable electric utilities in the us to start collecting information regarding the types and amount of mercury emitted as of january  to better understand mercury emissions  the epa required wp l to conduct stack tests at several of its generating stations 
both stations selected have completed their stack testing 
although the control of mercury emissions from generating plants is uncertain at this time  alliant energy believes that the capital investments and or modifications required to control mercury emissions could be significant 
pursuant to an internal review of operations in  ipc discovered that unit no 
at its generating facility in dubuque  iowa required a clean air act acid rain permit and cems 
ipc has informed its environmental regulators and has installed the cems and obtained the permit 
pursuant to its internal review  ipc also identified and disclosed to regulators a potentially similar situation at its lansing  iowa generating facility 
in the second quarter of  the epa determined that lansing units and are affected units 
therefore  in the third quarter of  ipc installed the cems at both of these facilities and in december ipc submitted its certification to the epa for the lansing facility 
ipc has received a settlement offer from the epa  dated december   to settle the matter for  ipc has since responded with a counter offer and negotiations continue 
on february   whiting received a notice of violation letter from the adeq  citing whiting for flaring sour gas in excess of permit limits and not having a valid permit 
in june  the adeq sent whiting a consent administrative order proposing a voluntary civil penalty of  for whiting s alleged emission violations 
the consent agreement was finalized on november   resulting in a civil penalty of  whiting performing two mitigation projects  installing an air monitor to run for one full year and submitting a title v permit 
wp l has been notified by the epa that it is a prp with respect to environmental impacts identified at the mig dewane landfill superfund site 
wp l is participating in the initiation of an alternate dispute resolution process to allocate liability associated with the investigation and remediation of the site 
management believes that any likely action resulting from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on wp l s financial condition or results of operations 
ipc has been notified by the epa that it is a prp with respect to environmental impacts identified at the missouri electric works  inc mew site in cape girardeau  missouri 
ipc has been served with a complaint filed by the mew site trust fund  the prp group involved in investigating and remediating the site  for response costs incurred by the prp group 
ipc believes that it is not liable as a prp for this site because it did not arrange for the disposal of any waste materials at the site 
ipc has filed an answer to the complaint  discovery is ongoing and settlement discussions continue 
wp l has been notified by monroe county  wisconsin that it is a prp with respect to environmental impacts identified at the monroe county interim landfill in sparta  wisconsin 
wp l has provided a summary of records and documents relating to waste disposal at the landfill to monroe county 
wp l cannot currently estimate what liability  if any  it may have with respect to this site 
a global treaty has been negotiated that could require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from utility plants 
in november  the us signed the treaty and agreed with the other countries to resolve all remaining issues by the end of at this time  management is unable to predict whether the us congress will ratify the treaty 
given the uncertainty of the treaty ratification and the ultimate terms of the final regulations  management cannot currently estimate the impact the implementation of the treaty would have on alliant energy s operations 
the low level radioactive waste policy amendments act of mandates that each state must take responsibility for the storage of low level radioactive waste produced within its borders 
the states of iowa and wisconsin are members of the six state midwest interstate low level radioactive waste compact compact which is responsible for development of any new disposal capability within the compact member states 
in june  the compact commissioners voted to discontinue work on a proposed waste disposal facility in the state of ohio because the expected cost of such a facility was comparably higher than other options currently available 
dwindling waste volumes and continued access to existing disposal facilities were also reasons cited for the decision 
a disposal facility located near barnwell  south carolina continues to accept the low level waste and iesu and wp l currently ship the waste each produces to such site  thereby minimizing the amount of low level waste stored on site 
given technological advances  waste compaction and the reduction in the amount of waste generated  daec and kewaunee each have on site storage capability sufficient to store low level waste expected to be generated over at least the next ten years 
while alliant energy is unable to predict how long the barnwell facility will continue to accept its waste  continuing access to this facility expands alliant energy s on site storage capability indefinitely 
see notes f and g of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of alliant energy s environmental issues 
power supply wisconsin enacted electric reliability legislation in wisconsin reliability act with the goal of assuring reliable electric energy for wisconsin 
the law allows the construction of merchant power plants in the state and streamlines the regulatory approval process for building new generation and transmission facilities 
as a requirement of the legislation  the pscw completed a regional transmission constraint study 
the pscw is authorized to order construction of new transmission facilities  based on the findings of its constraint study  through december  on september   the pscw ordered wp l and two other wisconsin utilities to arrange for additional electric capacity to help maintain reliable service for their customers 
in july  alliant energy and skygen announced an agreement whereby skygen would build  own and operate a power plant in wisconsin capable of producing up to mw of electricity 
under the agreement  alliant energy will purchase the capacity to meet the electric needs of its utility customers  as outlined by the wisconsin reliability act 
a third party filed an appeal to the epa appeals board on the issue of nox mitigation 
in the fourth quarter of  the wdnr issued a revised air permit which was appealed again by the third party 
in march  the epa denied the third party s final appeal which finalizes the air permitting process and allows for construction of the plant 
the epa appeal process resulted in the skygen project being delayed until the summer of alliant energy has made other contractual commitments to ensure an reserve margin in  as required for wisconsin 
part of this effort includes purchased power contracts at higher costs than the skygen power  including purchasing power from portable diesel generators that will be located at various substation locations within wp l s service territory 
these higher costs are included in a rate increase requested by wp l in december as discussed in liquidity and capital resources rates and regulatory matters wp l 
iesu and ipc are currently exploring the possibility of transitioning from the mapp reliability region to main so all of alliant energy will belong to the same reliability region 
alliant energy is unable to predict the outcome of this issue at this time 
alliant energy notes that it will take time for new transmission and power plant projects to be approved and built in wisconsin 
while alliant energy currently expects to meet customer demands in  unanticipated reliability issues could still arise in the event wisconsin experiences unexpected power plant outages  transmission system outages or extended periods of extremely hot weather
