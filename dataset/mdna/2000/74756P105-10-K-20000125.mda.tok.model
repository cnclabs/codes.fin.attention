this statement is effective for the company for periods beginning in fiscal year the company is currently not involved in derivative instruments or hedging activities  and therefore  will measure the impact of this statement as it becomes necessary 
impact of year the term year is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery and equipment as the year is approached and thereafter 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software has historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
the company s state of readiness 
the company established and implemented a formal plan year plan to i test its information technology systems to evaluate year compliance  ii assess the year compliance of its information technology vendors  iii assess its non information technology systems that utilize embedded technology such as micro controllers and iv determine the readiness of third parties such as government agencies  utility companies  telecommunication companies  suppliers and other non technology third party vendors third party vendors 
as of january   the company had not experienced any year related disruptions to its own internal systems nor have any third party vendors experienced any year disruptions that have materially affected their ability to do business with the company 
costs to address the company s year issues 
the company expensed costs associated with its year plan as the costs were incurred except for costs that the company would have otherwise capitalized 
remaining risks presented by year problems 
to operate its businesses  the company relies upon its third party vendors 
the company s ability to conduct its business is dependent upon the ability of its third party vendors to continue to avoid year related disruption 
though the company and its third party vendors do not appear to have suffered any significant year related disruptions as a result of the roll over from to  it is possible that certain year problems may exist but have not yet materialized 
if the company or its third party vendors have not adequately addressed their year issues  the company s business may be materially affected which could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
independent of the company s year plan  the company had previously determined it would replace its point of sale equipment in as many as of its full service dining restaurants

at that time  the franchise fee for new restaurants will increase from  to  for a year agreement and the royalty rate will increase from of sales to of sales  after a transitional period 
for franchise agreements entered into during the transitional period  the royalty rate will be of sales for the first years and of sales for the balance of the term 
for new restaurants  the transitional period will be from july  to june  as of july   the royalty rate will become of sales for the full term of new restaurant franchise agreements

royalties payable under existing franchise agreements are not effected by these changes 
burger king corporation is also offering a voluntary program to incent franchisees to renew their franchise agreements prior to the scheduled expiration date early renewal program 
franchisees that elect to participate in the early renewal program will be required to make capital investments in their restaurants by  among other things  bringing them up to burger king corporation s current image  and to extend occupancy leases 
franchise agreements entered into under the early renewal program will have special provisions regarding the royalty payable during the term  including a reduction in the royalty for a period of time 
the company is currently evaluating which  if any  of its restaurants would be suitable for the early renewal program 
in conducting its evaluation  the company will consider  among other things  the applicable royalty reductions  the nature  extent and resulting impact on sales from the required capital investment as well as the company s ability to extend its occupancy leases  where required 
the company intends to decide which  if any  of its restaurants it will include in the early renewal program by march  impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
increases in labor  food  and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operating procedures or increase menu prices to substantially offset increases in its operating costs 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at the company s restaurants
