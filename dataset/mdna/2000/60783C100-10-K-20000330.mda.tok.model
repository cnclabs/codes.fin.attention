seasonality historically  the company s quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
the company has typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the corresponding increases in manufacturing output required by such seasonality to meet currently foreseeable increases in this seasonal demand 
the company s first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  the company s operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
inflation during the past three years  the company has not been adversely affected by inflation  because it has been generally able to pass along to its customers increases in the costs of labor and materials 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
