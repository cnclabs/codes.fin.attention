item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations until april   the business of varian  inc the company was operated as the instruments business ib of varian associates  inc vai 
ib included the business units that designed  manufactured  sold  and serviced scientific instruments and vacuum technologies  and a business unit that provided contract electronics manufacturing services 
vai contributed ib to the company  then on april   vai distributed to the holders of record of vai common stock on march  one share of common stock of the company for each share of vai common stock outstanding on april  the distribution 
at the same time  vai contributed its semiconductor equipment business to varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc vsea and distributed to the holders of record of vai common stock on march  one share of common stock of vsea for each share of vai common stock outstanding on april  vai retained its health care systems business and changed its name to varian medical systems  inc vms effective as of april  these transactions were accomplished under the terms of an amended and restated distribution agreement dated as of january  by and among the company  vai  and vsea the distribution agreement 
for purposes of providing an orderly transition and to define certain ongoing relationships between and among the company  vms  and vsea after the distribution  the company  vms  and vsea also entered into certain other agreements which include an employee benefits allocation agreement  an intellectual property agreement  a tax sharing agreement  and a transition services agreement 
the consolidated financial statements generally reflect the company s results of operations and cash flows for the year ended september  and for the six month period ended october  the interim consolidated financial results for the six months ended april  were carved out from the interim financial statements of vai using the historical results of operations of ib and include the accounts of ib after elimination of inter business balances and transactions 
the consolidated financial statements also include allocations of certain vai corporate expenses including legal  accounting  employee benefits  insurance services  information technology services  treasury  and other corporate overhead to ib 
these amounts have been allocated to ib on the basis that is considered by management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to or the benefit obtained by ib 
typical measures and activity indicators used for allocation purposes include headcount  sales revenue  and payroll expense 
the company s management believes that the methods used to allocate these amounts are reasonable 
however  these allocations are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would have been or that will be recorded by the company on a stand alone basis 
the company s fiscal years reported are the or week periods which ended on the friday nearest september fiscal year comprises the week period ended on september  fiscal year comprises the week period ended on october  fiscal year comprises the week period ended on october  results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales were million in fiscal year  an increase of from sales of million in fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing segments increased by   and  respectively 
geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases declines of   and  respectively  as compared to fiscal year the significant increase in north america was largely due to the strong sales growth of the electronics manufacturing and vacuum technologies segments 
the decline in sales in europe resulted mainly from the strength of the us dollar versus the european currencies 
the significant increase in the rest of the world was primarily due to the general economic recovery of the asian markets 
gross profit 
gross profit was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the lower gross profit percentage in fiscal year resulted primarily from actions taken as part of an overall reorganization of ib  which included actions to prepare ib to separate from vai and become a stand alone company  other organization changes and a comprehensive product review  which resulted in a decision to accelerate transition from certain older to newer products necessitating the write down of certain excess and obsolete inventories and the lowering of prices to accelerate the liquidation of older products 
the impact of these actions on gross profit in fiscal year is in addition to the impact of the restructuring charges discussed below 
the gross profit margin in fiscal year reflects the revenue shift from the scientific instruments segment to the vacuum technologies and electronics manufacturing segments  which experienced greater sales growth but have lower gross profit margins than the scientific instruments segment 
all three segments experienced higher gross profit margins in fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the higher costs in fiscal year resulted from actions taken as part of the above described reorganization  including costs to move people and equipment to new consolidated locations  writedown of field demonstration equipment following the accelerated transition to newer products  and other higher than normal costs related to the reorganization 
these charges were in addition to the restructuring charges discussed below 
sales and marketing expenses in the fiscal year benefited from the cost savings from the fiscal year restructuring and reorganization activities  the overall leverage of higher sales as well as the effect of the stronger us dollar when translating local currency expenses into us dollars 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percent of sales also resulted from the revenue shift between the segments noted above  as the faster growing vacuum technologies and electronics manufacturing segments had lower operating expenses as a percent of sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to research and development expenses of million representing of sales in fiscal year the decrease in research and development expenses as a percent of sales was the result of the revenue shift between the segments noted above

fiscal year includes million of centralized corporate research  funded by ib while still part of vai 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the improvement in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the company s strategy to control these expenses as sales increase

the percentage of completion for these products ranged from to 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined using estimates of effort  value added  and degree of difficulty of the portion of each project completed as of the acquisition date  as compared to the remaining research and development needed to bring each project to technical feasibility 
an internal appraisal was performed which used the income approach to determine the fair value of the vankel business and its identifiable assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to the in process research and development 
the income approach includes an analysis of the markets  completion costs  cash flows  other required assets  contributions made by core technology  and risks associated with achieving such cash flows 
a risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the projects cash flows to determine the present value of the intangible assets including the in process research and development 
restructuring charges 
during the first half of fiscal year  ib s management approved a program to consolidate field sales and service organizations in europe  australia  and the united states so as to fall within the direct responsibility of management at ib s principal factories in those countries in order to reduce costs  simplify management structure and benefit from the infrastructure existing in those factories

liquidity and capital resources vai cash and debt allocations 
the distribution agreement provided for the division among the company  vsea  and vms of vai s cash and debt as of april  under the distribution agreement  the company was to assume of vai s term loans and receive an amount of cash from vai such that it would have net debt defined in the distribution agreement as the amount outstanding under the term loans and notes payable  less cash and cash equivalents equal to approximately of the net debt of the company and vms  subject to such adjustment as was necessary to provide vms with a net worth as defined in the distribution agreement of between and of the aggregate net worth of the company and vms  and subject to further adjustment to reflect the company s approximately share of the estimated proceeds  if any  to be received by vms after the distribution from the sale of vai s long term leasehold interest at certain of its palo alto facilities  together with certain related buildings and other corporate assets  and the company s obligation for approximately of any estimated transaction expenses to be paid by vms after the distribution in each case reduced for estimated taxes payable or tax benefits received from all sales and transaction expenses 
since the amounts transferred immediately prior to the distribution were based on estimates  these and other adjustments were required following the distribution 
as a result of these final adjustments  the company recorded an increase in stockholders equity of million in the second quarter of fiscal year management believes that no further adjustments are necessary  and that if any are required  they will not have a material effect on the company s financial condition 
as of september   the company had million in uncommitted credit facilities for working capital purposes 
as of september   no amount was outstanding under these credit facilities 
all of these credit facilities contain certain conditions and events of default customary for such facilities

as of september   the company also had other long term notes payable of million with an interest rate of and million with an interest rate of as of october  future principal payments on long term debt outstanding on september  will be million  million  million  million  million  and million during fiscal years      and thereafter  respectively 
based upon rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  the carrying amounts of long term debt and notes payable approximate estimated fair value 
cash and cash equivalents 
the company generated million of cash from operations in fiscal year  which compares to million in fiscal year the primary reason for this increase in cash generated was improved net earnings  tax benefit from deductions for stock option exercises  and a reduction in working capital requirements 
the company used million of cash for investing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million in fiscal year the company used million of cash for the acquisitions of vankel and an electronics manufacturing operation in poway  california and million for capital equipment in fiscal year investing activity in fiscal year was for capital equipment 
the company generated million of cash from financing activities in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year proceeds from stock options represented a significant amount of the financing reduced by scheduled debt payments and the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock under a stock repurchase plan approved in fiscal year the company s current business strategy contemplates possible acquisitions  further stock repurchases and or facility expansions 
any of these activities could utilize cash currently being generated by the company 
the distribution agreement provides that the company is responsible for certain litigation to which vai was a party  and further provides that the company will indemnify vms and vsea for one third of the costs  expenses  and other liabilities relating to certain discontinued  former  and corporate operations of vai  including certain environmental liabilities see environmental matters below 
the company s liquidity is affected by many other factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although the company s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the company s borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for fiscal year environmental matters the company s operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state  and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of the company s operations 
however  the company does not currently anticipate that its compliance with these regulations will have a material effect upon the company s capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
under the distribution agreement  the company and vsea each agreed to indemnify vms for one third of certain environmental investigation and remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs  as further described below 
vms has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  at eight sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling  treatment  or disposal 
vms is also involved in various stages of environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation under the direction of  or in consultation with  foreign  federal  state  and or local agencies at certain current vms or former vai facilities  or is reimbursing third parties which are undertaking such investigation  monitoring and or remediation activities 
for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
as of september   it was nonetheless estimated that the company s share of the future exposure for environmental related investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of september  no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is believed to be more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range  and the company therefore accrued million as of september  as to other sites and facilities  sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate the scope and costs of future environmental activities 
as of september   it was estimated that the company s share of the future exposure for environmental related investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of september  as to each of these sites and facilities  it was determined that a particular amount within the range of estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental liability than any other amount within the range  and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable 
together  these amounts totaled million at september  the company therefore accrued million as of september   which represents the best estimate of its share of these future costs discounted at  net of inflation 
this accrual is in addition to the million described in the preceding paragraph 
at september   the company s reserve for environmental liabilities  based upon future environmental related costs estimated by the company as of that date  was calculated as follows total recurring non recurring anticipated costs costs future costs fiscal year in millions thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount less current portion long term included in other liabilities the amounts set forth in the foregoing table are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates 
the aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation and remediation activities and the large number of sites where such investigation and remediation activities are being undertaken 
lawsuits for recovery of environmental investigation and remediation costs already incurred  and to be incurred in the future  were filed by vai against various insurance companies and other third parties 
following settlements with various insurance companies  vms is still pursuing lawsuits against an insurance company and certain other third parties for the benefit of itself  vsea  and the company 
in addition  an insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of vai s now vms future environmental related expenditures for which the company has an indemnity obligation  and the company therefore has a million receivable in other assets as of september  for the company s share of such recovery 
the company has not reduced any environmental related liability in anticipation of recovery on claims made against third parties 
the company s management believes that its reserves for the foregoing and certain other environmental related matters are adequate  but as the scope of its obligation becomes more clearly defined  these reserves may be modified  and related charges or credits against earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters described herein could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to the company s financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available and its best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events  the company s management believes that the costs of these environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
legal proceedings in the distribution agreement  the company agreed to defend and indemnify vsea and vms for costs  liabilities  and expenses with respect to legal proceedings relating to the instruments business of vai  and agreed to reimburse vms for one third of certain costs and expenses after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs and expenses that are paid after april  and arise from actual or potential claims or legal proceedings relating to discontinued  former  or corporate operations of vai 
from time to time  the company is involved in a number of its own legal actions and could incur an uninsured liability in one or more of them 
while the ultimate outcome of all of the foregoing legal matters is not determinable  management believes that these matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one new common currency the euro 
the euro then began trading on currency exchanges and began to be used in certain business transactions 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro occurs through june beginning january   new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued 
simultaneously  legacy currencies will begin to be withdrawn from circulation with the completion of the withdrawal scheduled for no later than july  because of the company s significant sales and operating profits generated in the european union  the company has initiated a program to identify and address risks arising from the conversion to the euro currency 
these risks include  but are not limited to  converting information technology systems to handle the new currency  evaluating the competitive impact of one common currency due to  among other things  increased cross border price transparency  evaluating the company s exposure to currency exchange risks during and following the transition period to the euro  and determining the impact on the company s processes for preparing and maintaining accounting and taxation records 
the company believes that it is taking appropriate steps to prepare for the euro conversion and to mitigate its effects on the company s business  and that the euro conversion is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
however  the company is still assessing the risks that might arise from the euro conversion and the costs to address those risks  and therefore cannot assure that the euro conversion will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas and sfas require derivatives to be measured at fair value and to be recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
the accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those derivatives would be dependent upon the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas and sfas are effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas and sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year the company does not believe the implementation of sfas and sfas will have a material effect on its financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
sab is effective no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december   and requires companies to report any changes in revenue recognition as a cumulative change in accounting principle at the time of implementation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting changes 
in october  the securities and exchange commission issued sab frequently asked questions and answers which the company is utilizing to determine the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
the company typically hedges its currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies and with anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
as a result  the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s forward exchange contracts have generally ranged from one to months in original maturity  and no forward exchange contract has had an original maturity greater than one year 
forward exchange contracts outstanding as of september   that hedge the balance sheet and certain purchase commitments were effective on september   and accordingly there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with such contracts and the fair value of these contracts approximates their notional values 
forward exchange contracts outstanding as of september  notional value notional sold value purchased in thousands australian dollar  japanese yen  euro  canadian dollar  british pound   total   interest rate risk the company has no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the company invests primarily in short term us treasury securities  and changes in interest rates would not be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
at september  the company s debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
the estimated fair value of the company s debt obligations approximates the principal amounts reflected below on rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
although payments under certain of the company s operating leases for its facilities are tied to market indices  the company is not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with its operating leases 
debt obligations principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity fiscal years thereafter total in thousands long term debt including current portion        average interest rate
