in fiscal year  phoenixnet tm is focusing on an internet security infrastructure product 
on march   the company s majority owned subsidiary  insilicon  closed its initial public offering of million shares 
proceeds  net of issuance costs  to insilicon were approximately million 
the principal purpose of the offering was to increase insilicon s equity capital  to create a public market for its common stock  to facilitate future access to public equity markets  to improve the effectiveness of its stock option plan in attracting and retaining key employees  to provide liquidity to the company and to provide increased visibility of insilicon in the marketplace 
on september   the company owned approximately of insilicon s common stock 
in september  award software international  inc award was merged with a majority owned subsidiary of phoenix 
award was a leading provider of system enabling and management software that includes a suite of bios products for designers and manufacturers of motherboards  pc systems and other microprocessor based or embedded devices 
in the merger  each share of award common stock was exchanged for shares of its common stock an aggregate of approximately million shares of its common stock 
in addition  outstanding award employee stock options and warrants were converted at the same exchange ratio into options and warrants to purchase approximately million and million shares of its common stock  respectively 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests for financial reporting purposes  and was structured to qualify as a tax free reorganization 
all prior period financial statements have been restated as if the merger took place at the beginning of such periods 
also in september  the company completed the acquisition of sand microelectronics sand  a supplier of synthesizable cores for the computer industry 
synthesizable cores are pre packaged circuit descriptions used as building blocks for system level application specific integrated circuits asics 
these asics are used to connect computers and peripheral devices using pci  agp  usb  ieee  irda and other emerging industry standard protocols 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash   shares of its common stock  stock options to purchase approximately  shares of its common stock in exchange for sand stock options  and an earn out agreement of up to million payable through fiscal  subject to the achievement of certain performance objectives 
under the terms of the earn out agreement  the selling stockholders may earn additional purchase price consideration for each of the three years ending september   contingent upon the financial performance of insilicon 
the maximum contingent consideration is million  of which approximately million represents minimum anticipated payments that were recorded as accrued merger costs 
future payments are due subsequent to the end of each of the three fiscal years ending september  and payments in excess of amounts accrued  if any  will be recorded as additional goodwill and amortized over the remaining life of the original goodwill recorded 
approximately  was earned in fiscal year and is scheduled to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal approximately  was earned in fiscal year and paid in fiscal year the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of operations of sand subsequent to the date of acquisition have been included in its consolidated results of operations 
results of operations the following table includes consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended september   and  as a percentage of total revenue revenue license fees services total revenue cost of revenue license fees services amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets stock based compensation merger  acquisition and restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue the company s products are generally designed into personal computer systems  information appliances and semiconductors 
license fee and service revenue by segment for the three years ended september   and were as follows dollars in thousands amount change of consolidated revenue platform enabling    insilicon    phoenixnet tm  n a n a intercompany eliminations  n a n a total revenue    in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded million of revenues from two oem customers relating to volume royalty license agreements 
these agreements were non refundable and due and payable within days 
those amounts were collected within the day period 
these two customers previously purchased on a monthly royalty basis 
as a result of the change in these customers buying strategies  revenues from these two customers are expected to resume in the second half of the fiscal year the company will derive future revenues throughout fiscal year from existing and new customers as well as existing and new products 
the amount of future revenues cannot be quantified at this time 
insilicon revenue increased due to the greater market acceptance of semiconductor intellectual property  the increased acceptance of re use licenses of semiconductor intellectual property to existing customers  and increased service revenue due to increased maintenance revenue from insilicon s growing installed base of customers 
comparison of phoenixnet tm revenues in fiscal to the fiscal is not applicable  since phoenixnet first generated revenues in the second quarter of fiscal platform enabling revenue decreased by million or in fiscal due to declines in average selling prices due to pc price declines  the loss of a significant north american customer due to acquisition and the discontinuation of the pico and pc enhancing division and some of its products 
pico and pc enhancing division provided system software and services for pcs and industrial  hand held and consumer information appliances based on the intel x and unix architectures 
insilicon revenue increased by million or in fiscal due to the acquisition of sand and the continued demand for outsourced circuit ip 
revenue by geographic region for the three years ended september   and was as follows dollars in thousands amount of revenue change of consolidated revenue north america    asia    europe    total revenue    in fiscal  asian revenue increased while north american revenue remained relatively flat and european revenue decreased 
this was due primarily to the outsourcing of system design and manufacturing to asian pc and motherboard manufacturers  insilicon s release of their usb controller  growth in japan pc shipments in the platform enabling segment  and a shift in revenue from the european market to the asian market 
asian revenue in fiscal increased despite lower average selling prices of its bios products than in fiscal partly due to a recent shift in demand for personal computers from desktop to notebook computers 
in fiscal  u 
s 
and european revenue declined while asian revenue increased primarily due to the increased insourcing by u 
s 
and european pc oems of systems and to increased japan pc shipments 
one customer  fujitsu  accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of revenue in fiscal  or service revenue decreased million or in fiscal primarily due to the market shift within the platform enabling segment to asia where a higher proportion of total revenues has historically been generated from license fees  the timing of new processor chip releases from semiconductor chip manufacturers and the shift toward recurring license revenues versus non recurring service revenues  partially offset by increases in insilicon s service revenues due to increased maintenance revenue generated from insilicon s growing installed base of customers 
service revenue was unchanged at of revenue in fiscal and gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the costs of revenue was million and million of amortization of purchased technologies from sand for fiscal and also included in the costs of revenue in fiscal and was a reversal of million of previous year s year yk support cost and million of yk support cost 
for fiscal  and  gross margin as a percentage of revenue before the amortization of purchased technology and yk support costs reversal of yk support costs was  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was due to an increase in license revenues from the platform enabling division and insilicon  especially in asia  as discussed above 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was attributable to an increase in insilicon revenue discussed above 
license fee gross margin as a percentage of license fee revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
service gross margin as a percentage of revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software development costs charged to cost of revenue in fiscal  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses represented  and  respectively 
in fiscal  research and development expenses decreased million or due to the improvement of product and resource management resulting in lower headcount and the movement of research and development centers to asia and japan where costs are lower partially offset by an increase in variable compensation due to the attainment of increased revenue 
in fiscal  research and development expenses decreased million or due to decreased personnel resulting from the consolidation of operations between the company and award and reductions in development spending on pico and pc enhancing products 
the company capitalized approximately million  million and million of internal software development costs in fiscal  and  respectively 
these decreases were due to a higher proportion of costs being incurred on non capitalizable projects 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses represented in fiscal and  and in fiscal in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased million or due primarily to an increase in variable compensation due to the attainment of increased revenue  costs related to sales meetings and an increase in outsourcing of non recurring engineering work 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased million or due to increased branding and marketing activities associated with the establishment of the phoenixnet tm division 
management has made a conscious effort to increase sales and marketing efforts through the reallocation of resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively  and represented  and of total revenue  respectively 
the cost increase in fiscal was primarily due to increases in personnel  especially in the phoenixnet tm segment and insilicon  and increased variable compensation due to higher profitability 
merger  acquisition and restructuring costs merger  acquisition and restructuring charges during the years ended september    and  were as follows years ended september  in thousands out of pocket merger and acquisition costs  severance and other exit costs    asset write offs   in process research and development  charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance benefits associated with the elimination of three management positions 
the charges were related to the streamlining of certain management functions in taiwan and north america 
all terminations have been completed as of september  approximately million of the fiscal restructuring charges were unpaid as of september   which will be paid through fiscal charges the charges in fiscal were related to realigning the business into three operating divisions  the consolidation of certain facilities and operations  and steps to integrate award and sand 
included in the fourth quarter of fiscal was a restructuring charge of million associated with streamlining certain operations  facilities consolidations including closing the office in the united kingdom  and discontinuing or de emphasizing certain products of insilicon 
the restructuring plan included million in severance benefits associated with the elimination of approximately positions in engineering  sales  marketing  and administration from various product divisions  field operations including field engineering and sales  and management primarily in the united kingdom and north america  million of asset write offs mostly capitalized software of the insilicon division  million in facilities abandonment  and million of other business exit costs pursuant to the re organization plan 
the company also reversed million of severance charges from prior restructuring plans as a result of the decision to retain certain positions 
of the terminations  all had been completed as of september  included in the third quarter of fiscal was a restructuring charge of million associated with the discontinuation of the pico and pc enhancing division and severance related to certain management positions 
of the million  million were associated with the write off of pico and pc enhancing related capitalized software  million for severance benefits for a management position  and million for other general administrative expenses 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the facilities consolidations and streamlining certain field operations and other functions  including closing the offices in texas and france 
the restructuring charge included million of severance benefits associated with the elimination of approximately positions in engineering  sales  marketing  and administration from various product divisions  field operations  and general administrative functions  as well as million related to facilities abandonment 
charges included in the fourth quarter of fiscal was a charge of million related to the acquisitions of award and sand 
the charge consisted of million of out of pocket costs  million of asset write offs  million in severance benefits associated with the elimination of positions in north america in various departments  million in facilities abandonment  and a million of in process research and development charge 
included in the third quarter of is a restructuring charge of million related to the severance benefits for eliminating approximately positions in engineering  sales  marketing  and administration from various divisions as a result of the consolidation of certain functions and the elimination of certain management positions 
out of pocket merger and acquisition costs of million in fiscal include legal  accounting and investment banking fees associated with the acquisition of award 
asset write offs of million include the carrying value of assets that were determined to be redundant as a result of either merger or restructuring activities 
as of september   substantially all fiscal restructuring charges have been paid 
the in process research and development charge in fiscal was an allocation of a portion of the purchase price for sand for projects that were not yet capitalizable under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the allocation was based upon an independent appraisal 
the appraised value was determined by estimating the future net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate applied includes a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
if these projects are not successfully developed  future revenue and profitability of its company may be adversely affected 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
stock based compensation the stock based compensation charges in fiscal were mostly due to the granting of options to purchase insilicon stock at exercise prices less than the fair market value of insilicon common stock on the grant date 
interest and other income  net net interest income is primarily derived from cash  short and long term investments and marketable securities 
the income generated each period is highly dependent on available cash and fluctuations in government interest rates 
the average interest rate earned in fiscal was approximately 
in addition  certain trade balances are denominated in foreign currencies  and therefore are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
net interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of which million in was insilicon interest 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to interest received on higher cash balances as a result of proceeds insilicon received from the initial public offering of insilicon stock 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the average cash balances available for investment as a result of cash payments related to the acquisition of sand and stock repurchases 
net other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal to million in  mainly due to the sale of additional shares of xionics document technologies  inc xionics common stock 
the company recorded a gain of million on the sale of  shares all of its remaining ownership interest of xionics common stock in fiscal  as compared to a gain of million on the sale of  shares of xionics common stock in fiscal provision for income taxes the company recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
excluding non deductible in process research and development and transaction costs related to the acquisitions of award and sand in fiscal  its effective tax rate was in fiscal  and the company s effective tax rate excluding non deductible acquisition charges and transaction costs has been lower than the statutory rate due to various federal and state tax credits and lower tax rates imposed on foreign earnings in certain jurisdictions 
insilicon is not consolidated for income tax purposes  as the company owns less than of the voting stock issued and outstanding as of september  new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which the company will be required to adopt for the year ending december  sfas establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
because the company currently holds no derivative financial instruments and does not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab which outlines the staff s position on various revenue recognition issues 
sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 
opinion 
fin clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin was effective july   except requirements regarding certain events that occur after december  or january  but before the effective date should be applied prospectively 
fin will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fluctuations in operating results the tables in part ii  item of this form k include selected unaudited quarterly consolidated data for fiscal and this information was derived from its unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present this information  when read in conjunction with its annual consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
the company s future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of its license fees are subject to a number of factors that make estimating revenue and operating results prior to the end of a quarter uncertain 
while the company receives recurring revenue on royalty based license agreements and some agreements contain minimum quarterly royalty commitments  a significant amount of license fees in any quarter is dependent on signing agreements and delivering the licensed software in that quarter 
generally  the company has experienced a pattern of recording or more of its quarterly revenue in the third month of the quarter 
the company has historically monitored its revenue bookings through regular  periodic worldwide forecast reviews within the quarter 
these reviews keep management informed of areas where additional selling efforts may be needed in order to meet the internal plans and market expectations 
there can be no assurances that this process will result in its meeting revenue expectations 
operating expenses for any year are normally based on the attainment of planned revenue levels for that year and are incurred ratably throughout the year 
as a result  if revenue were less than planned in any period while expense levels remain relatively fixed  its operating results would be adversely affected for that period 
in addition  unplanned expenses could adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses were incurred 
business risks the additional following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating its company and its business 
product development the company s long term success will depend on its ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products timely and cost effectively that meet the needs of customers in present and emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or in enhancing existing products or that new or enhanced products will meet market requirements 
delays in introducing new products can adversely impact acceptance and revenue generated from the sale of such products 
the company has  from time to time  experienced such delays 
the company s software products and their enhancements contain complex code that may contain undetected errors and or bugs when first introduced 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will not contain errors or bugs that will adversely affect commercial acceptance of such new products or enhancements 
the introduction of new products depends on acceptance of e commerce and adoption of digital devices 
protection of intellectual property the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its software products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to its technology 
in addition  copyright and trade secret protection for its products may be unavailable or unreliable in certain foreign countries 
the company has been issued twenty one patents with respect to its current product offerings and has more than sixty five patent applications pending with respect to certain of the products the company markets 
the company maintains an active internal program designed to identify internally developed inventions worthy of being patented 
there can be no assurance that any of the applications pending will be approved and patents issued or that its engineers will be able to develop technologies capable of being patented 
as the number of software patents increases  the company believes that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that its patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by it 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  may be time consuming and expensive to defend  can trigger indemnity obligations owed by it to third parties  and may have an adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
infringement of valid patents or copyrights or misappropriation of valid trade secrets  whether alleged against it  or its customers  and regardless of whether such claims have merit  could also have an adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
importance of microsoft and intel for a number of years  the company has worked closely with leading software and semiconductor companies in developing standards for the pc industry 
the company remains optimistic regarding relationships with these industry leaders 
however  there can be no assurance that leading software and semiconductor companies will not develop alternative product strategies that could conflict with its product plans and marketing strategies 
action by such companies may adversely impact its business and results of operations 
presently  there is little overlap or conflict in the company s product offerings  although these companies now incorporate some functionality that has traditionally resided in the bios 
these leading software and semiconductor companies  in their endeavors to add value  incorporate features or functions provided by the company either in the silicon or in the operating system 
therefore  the company must continually create new features and functions to sustain  as well as increase  its software s added value to oems 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these efforts 
attraction and retention of key personnel the company s ability to achieve its revenue and operating performance objectives will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain technically qualified engineering  sales  marketing and finance personnel 
in particular  approximately to of its employees are involved in engineering efforts 
semiconductor sip and internet products are based on new and emerging technologies that are different from bios technologies 
the available pool of engineering talent is limited for all three operating segments 
accordingly  failure to attract  retain and grow its research and development teams could adversely affect its business and operating results 
all of its executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
the company might not be able to execute its business plan if the company were to lose the services of any of its key personnel 
several of its executives and other employees joined the company only recently and have had only a limited time to work together 
the company s management team might not be able to work effectively together or with the rest of its employees to develop its technology and manage its continuing operations 
dependence on key customers  concentration of credit risk the loss of any key customer and its inability to replace revenue provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
the company s customer base includes large oems in the pc  semiconductor and internet markets  large internet portals and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  the company maintains individually significant receivable balances due from some of them 
if these customers fail to meet guaranteed minimum royalty payments and other payment obligations  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
as of september   its largest receivable balance from any one customer represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
competition the market for its bios products is very competitive  resulting in downward pricing pressure 
in marketing its bios products  the company competes primarily with in house research and development departments of pc manufacturers that may have significantly greater financial and technical resources than ours 
these companies include acer incorporated  compaq computer corporation  dell computer corporation  international business machines corporation and toshiba corporation 
the company also competes for system software business with other independent suppliers  ranging from small  privately held companies to acer softech  a division of acer labs  a major taiwan chip and motherboard supplier 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully with its current competitors or potential new competitors 
there can be no assurance that intense competition in the industry and particular actions of its competitors will not have an adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
due to the competitive nature of the business and the overall price pressures within the pc market  the company expects that prices on many of its products may decrease in the future and that such price decreases could have an adverse impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
the sip industry is very competitive and is characterized by constant technological change  rapid rates of product obsolescence  and frequently emerging new suppliers 
the company s existing competitors include other merchant sip suppliers  such as the mentor graphics inventra division  synopsys  vautomation and zayante  suppliers of asic semiconductors  such as lsi logic  and the asic divisions of ibm microelectronics  lucent  toshiba and nec  and to a lesser degree suppliers of field programmable gate array  or fpga  semiconductors  such as altera  xilinx  actel and quicklogic 
the company also competes with the internal development organizations of large  vertically integrated semiconductor and systems companies  such as intel  motorola  cisco and hp 
in these companies  sip developed for an individual project sometimes is subject to efforts by the company to re use the sip in multiple projects 
companies whose principle business is providing design services as work for hire  such as intrinsix  sican  and tality also provide competition 
in the internet business  there are many distribution vehicles for its partners to reach pc end users  including pc oem companies  pc and hardware registration companies and internet web sites 
many have greater resources than the company 
international sales and activities revenue derived from the international operations of its platform enabling division comprises a majority of total revenue 
there can be no assurances that the company will not experience significant fluctuations in international revenue 
while the major portion of its license fee or royalty contracts are us dollar denominated  the company is entering into an increasing number of contracts denominated in local currencies 
the company has sales and engineering offices in germany  japan  korea and taiwan and uses a software engineering firm in india 
the company s operations and financial results may be adversely affected by factors associated with international operations  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances  political instability in emerging markets  difficulties in attracting qualified employees  and language  cultural and other difficulties managing foreign operations 
volatile market for phoenix stock the market for its stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of its common stock has been  and will continue to be  subject to fluctuations in response to operating and financial results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or customer contracts by the company or its competitors  changes in its or its competitors product mix or product direction  changes in its revenue mix and revenue growth rates  changes in expectations of growth for the pc industry  as well as other events or factors which the company may not be able to influence or control 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the market in which the company does business  companies with which the company competes or relating to it specifically could have an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of its stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many small capitalization  high technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
certain anti takeover effect the company s certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these include provisions under which members of the board of directors are divided into three classes and are elected to serve staggered three year terms 
in addition  in connection with the february sale of shares representing of its outstanding common stock and of a warrant to purchase an additional of the company s then outstanding stocks  the company granted intel corporation certain rights in the event of solicited or unsolicited offers to acquire the company 
rapid change with the internet critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service  potential tax or other government regulation  may affect the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support its software products and the functionality of some of its products 
if the company is unsuccessful in timely assimilating changes in the internet environment in its business operations and product development efforts  its future net revenue and operating results could be adversely affected 
business disruptions while the company has not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of its products  such viruses could be created and deployed against its products in the future 
similarly  experienced computer programmers or hackers may attempt to penetrate its network security or the security of its web sites from time to time 
a hacker who penetrates its network or web sites could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of its services 
the company might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by virus creators and or hackers 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
phoenix reported million consolidated cash in fiscal  of which million was restricted and owned by insilicon 
the company believes that current cash  short term investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating and capital requirements on a short term and long term basis 
in the second quarter of fiscal  insilicon raised net proceeds of approximately million from its initial public offering 
in addition  insilicon has a million revolving line of credit with a commercial bank that expires in january there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at september  in fiscal  the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million worth of outstanding shares of common stock over a month period

the company also repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million and completed the repurchase program in first quarter of fiscal the company has repurchased an additional  shares during the first two months of fiscal at a cost of million 
in fiscal  the board of directors authorized two programs to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock 
under these programs  the company repurchased million shares during fiscal at a total aggregate cost of million 
the programs were completed in first quarter of changes in financial condition phoenix reported million consolidated cash in fiscal  of which million was restricted and owned by insilicon

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s investments are in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  its future investment income may fall short of expectations  or the company may suffer a loss in principal if it is forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its short term investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk international revenues from its foreign subsidiaries were  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international sales are primarily from its foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  its future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to its foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states
