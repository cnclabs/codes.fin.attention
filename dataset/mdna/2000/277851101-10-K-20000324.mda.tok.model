fiscal years   and results of operations the company s results of operations for the first three quarters of continued to be negatively impacted by a sales decline resulting from a vendor contaminated product problem in all five garcia s locations in the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area 
upon discovery  the company immediately dispatched several crisis management teams to the market  which along with the cooperation of the maricopa county health department minimized the impact 
the contaminated product was immediately removed from the menu in all garcia s locations 
no cases of food borne illness were reported outside of the phoenix market 
the company has adequate insurance coverage in place for the actual and anticipated claims made by customers who became ill as a result of the product contamination 
however  at the time that the illnesses occurred  the company did not have insurance coverage for the loss of business income resulting from the related negative publicity 
this coverage has since been added to the company s insurance portfolio 
the company has retained legal counsel to address the issue of settlement or litigation regarding its loss of revenues  business income and reputation resulting from the vendor contamination 
in addition  the company was adversely impacted by slower sales in its mall based units in the second and third quarters of the company also incurred substantial expenses related to its ufoc franchise agreement and the development of a franchise program which should be one time expenses in the third and fourth quarters of during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented an aggressive advertising campaign system wide and cost cutting measures at all levels  which has resulted in increased sales in its garfield s and higher levels of controllable profit in garcia s

the increase was primarily due to the introduction of a new menu design  a successful television advertising campaign during the fourth quarter of  the success of continued radio and newspaper advertising and the implementation of a mall employee rewards program in selected locations 
continuing royalties were  in   in and  in the decrease in is a result of the company s acquisition of three franchised garfield s restaurants 
the increase in from  is primarily due to the opening of a new franchised garfield s during the first quarter of  and a full year of royalties being recognized from two franchised garcia s which joined the system as a result of the famous acquisition in november  partially offset by decreased royalties related to three formerly franchised garfield s which were acquired by the company in july other income during was  as compared to  in during  the company was paid a fee of  to terminate an agreement under which the company managed a carlos murphy s restaurant owned by an independent third party

garfield s costs of sales as a percentage of food and beverage sales increased in to from in garcia s costs of sales as a percentage of food and beverage sales decreased to in from in and in from in this decrease is primarily due to the implementation of the company s purchasing techniques in these restaurants and increased vendor rebates 
garfield s costs of sales as a percentage of food and beverage sales decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to continued menu development  increased vendor rebates  and improved store level food and beverage cost controls 
garfield s labor costs as a percentage of food and beverage sales increased in to from in this increase is primarily due to increased kitchen labor and restaurant level management salaries and incentive compensation 
the increase in kitchen labor is primarily due to an increase in the federal minimum wage in late labor costs for garcia s as a percentage of food and beverage sales decreased to in from in labor costs for garfield s increased in to of food and beverage sales compared to in operating expenses which include labor costs as a percentage of food and beverage sales were in  in  and in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of food and beverage sales in compared to and is due primarily to the addition of the garcia s  carlos murphy s and casa lupitas which generally have higher labor costs than garfield s due to more labor intensive kitchen operations

pre opening costs the company expenses pre opening costs as incurred 
during each of the three years in the period ended december   the company incurred and recognized as expense the following amounts for restaurant pre opening costs relative to the corresponding number of restaurants opened total pre opening costs    restaurants opened average pre opening costs per restaurant opened    total pre opening costs as a percentage of food and beverage sales the increase in pre opening costs reflect delays experienced relative to two new restaurants opened in and management expects future pre opening costs to be lower 
under the company s policy of expensing pre opening costs as incurred  income from operations  on an annual and quarterly basis  could be adversely affected during periods of restaurant development 
however  the company believes that its initial investment in the restaurant pre opening costs yields a long term benefit of increased operating income in subsequent periods 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position no 
sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires start up costs to be expensed as incurred 
sop was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier application is encouraged 
the adoption of sop did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations  as the prescribed accounting treatment is consistent with the company s current accounting policy regarding pre opening costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in in  general and administrative expenses decreased from in the higher absolute levels of general and administrative expenses from to are related primarily to additional personnel costs and related costs of operating the company s expanding restaurant group 
the company anticipates that its costs of supervision and administration of company and franchise stores will increase at a slower rate than revenue increases during the next few years 
provision for impairment of long lived assets the company s restaurants are reviewed on an individual restaurant basis for indicators of impairment  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its restaurants may not be recoverable 
the company s primary test for an indicator of potential impairment is operating losses 
in order to determine whether impairment has occurred  the company estimates the future net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of its restaurants and the eventual disposition  as of the date of determination  and compares such estimated future cash flows to the respective carrying amounts 
those restaurants  which have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows  are deemed impaired 
the carrying value of these restaurants is adjusted to an estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows attributable to such restaurants using a discount rate equivalent to the rate of return the company expects to achieve from its investment in newly constructed restaurants 
the excess is charged to expense and cannot be reinstated 
considerable management judgment and certain significant assumptions are necessary to estimate future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions used by the company in evaluating its assets for impairment include  but may not be limited to estimations of future sales levels  costs of sales  direct and indirect costs of operating the assets  the length of time the assets will be utilized and the company s ability to utilize equipment  fixtures and other moveable long lived assets in other existing or future locations 
in addition  such estimates and assumptions include anticipated operating results related to certain profit improvement programs implemented by the company during  and  as well as the continuation of certain rent reductions  deferrals  and other negotiated concessions from certain landlords 
actual results could vary significantly from management s estimates and assumptions and such variance could result in a change in the estimated recoverability of the company s long lived assets 
accordingly  the results of the changes in those estimates could have a material impact on the company s future results of operations and financial position 
during  the company recorded a  provision for impairment of long lived assets related to four locations 
during  the company recorded a  provision for impairment of long lived assets related to one location 
in the normal course of business  management performs a regular review of the strength of its operating assets 
it is management s plan to continue to make such decisions to close under performing restaurants and or dispose of other assets it considers in the best long term interest of the company s shareholders 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased in to  of food and beverage sales compared to  of food and beverage sales in and  of food and beverage sales in the increase in expense in compared to is primarily attributable to the increase in net assets subject to depreciation and amortization in versus as the result of the famous acquisition and the openings and acquisitions of additional restaurants in the expense increase in versus relates principally to the increase in net assets subject to depreciation and amortization because of the opening additional restaurants and the remodeling of existing restaurants 
interest expense interest expense during each of the three years in the period ended december   was  in   in  and  in additionally  the company has capitalized approximately   and  of interest costs during  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in compared to is due principally to the company s purchase of  shares for a total of  in february the increase in interest expense in compared to is attributable to an increase in the average borrowing balances under the company s revolving credit agreements and the increase in the company s long term debt as a result of the famous acquisition 
income taxes the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which uses an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was  in the provision for income tax was   respectively  for and at december   the company has recorded a benefit for its deferred tax assets of approximately  management believes that  of the assets will be recognized through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences with the remainder to be recognized through realization of future income 
it is management s opinion  based on the historical trend of normal and recurring operating results  present store development and forecasted operating results  that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the approximately  in the future income before provisions for income taxes in the next three years necessary to recognize the deferred tax assets not otherwise offset by reversing taxable temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards do not begin to expire until and general business tax credits until while management of the company is not presently aware of any adverse matters  it is possible that the company s ability to realize the deferred income tax assets could be impaired if there are significant future exercises of non qualified stock options or if the company were to experience declines in sales and or profit margins as a result of loss of market share  increased competition or other adverse general economic conditions 
management intends to evaluate the reliability of the net deferred tax asset at least quarterly by assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
net income per share amounts in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  earnings per share  which requires the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share eps 
basic eps includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
the weighted average common shares outstanding for the basic eps calculation were  and  in and  respectively 
eps for was anti dilutive 
diluted eps is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive common stock equivalents 
the sum of the weighted average common shares and common share equivalents for the diluted eps calculation were   and  in  and  respectively 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas in the fourth quarter of impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food and beverage products  labor and real estate can affect the company s operations 
over the past few years  inflation has had a lesser impact on the company s operations due to the lower rates of inflation in the nation s economy and the economic conditions in the company s market area 
management believes the company has historically been able to pass on increased costs through certain selected menu price increases and increased productivity and purchasing efficiencies  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
management anticipates that the average cost of restaurant real estate leases and construction costs could increase in the future which could affect the company s ability to expand 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s working capital ratio decreased to 
to compared to to at december  as is customary in the restaurant industry  the company has consistently operated with negative working capital and has not historically required large amounts of working capital 
historically  the company has leased the vast majority of its restaurant locations

in addition  the company expended approximately  for the famous acquisition in november the famous acquisition was financed primarily through a term loan with a bank described below 
during  the company expects to construct and open up to five new garfield s and three garcia s 
the company believes the cash generated from its operations and borrowing availability under its credit facility described below  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s net capital expenditures and working capital requirements through in november  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank to hedge its risk exposure to potential increases in libor 
this agreement has a term of five years and an initial notional amount of  the notional amount declines quarterly over the life of the agreement on a seven year amortization schedule assuming a fixed interest rate of 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  the company pays interest quarterly on the notional amount at a fixed rate of  and receives interest quarterly on the notional amount at a floating rate of three month libor plus 
in april  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
in july  an additional  shares were authorized for repurchase 
as of december    shares had been repurchased under this plan for a total purchase price of approximately  no additional shares have been repurchased subsequent to december  in february  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares of its common stock from astoria capital partners  lp  montavilla partners  lp  and microcap partners lp sellers for a purchase price of per share or an aggregate purchase price of  the shares purchased from the sellers represented of the outstanding common stock of the company  prior to the transaction 
in connection with this transaction  the company entered into a new credit facility with a bank in the aggregate amount of  of which a maximum of  is available to the company under a revolving line of credit and  was available to the company under a term loan 
certain proceeds of the term loan approximately million were used for the stock purchase from the sellers 
the balance of the proceeds under the term loan approximately million and the proceeds under the revolving line of credit were used to retire indebtedness under the company s existing loan agreement 
the revolving line of credit has a two year term and initially bears interest at a floating rate of three month libor plus initially  which is reset quarterly 
the term loan also provides for an initial floating rate of interest equal to three month libor plus and requires quarterly installments of principal and interest in the amount necessary to fully amortize the outstanding principal balance over a seven year period  with a final maturity on the fifth anniversary of the note 
the term loan converts to a five year amortization schedule if the company s debt coverage ratio  as defined in the loan agreement  exceeds a certain level 
also  the floating interest rate on both facilities is subject to changes in the company s ratio of total loans and capital leases to net worth 
under the terms of these notes  the company s minimum floating rate is libor plus and the maximum floating rate is libor plus 
borrowings under this loan agreement are unsecured 
the loan agreement does contain certain financial covenants and restrictions 
as of the date of this report  the company is in compliance with these covenants and restrictions 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive or embedded computer chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company estimates that approximately  was spent to solve the year issue 
the company experienced no material effects or losses due to this issue 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of the date of this report  the company has an available revolving line of credit in the amount of  as well as outstanding borrowings under a term loan of approximately  both loans bear interest at floating rate of three month libor plus as of the date of this report
