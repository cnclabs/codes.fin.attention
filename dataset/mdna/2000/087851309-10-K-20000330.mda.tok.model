item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general governmental regulation and reimbursement healthcare system reform and concerns over rising medicare and medicaid costs continue to be high priorities for both the federal and state governments 
in august  the president signed into law the balanced budget act of the act in which congress included numerous program changes directed at balancing the federal budget 
the legislation changed medicare and medicaid policy in a number of ways  including i the phase in of a medicare prospective payment system pps for skilled nursing facilities effective july  see below  ii establishment of limitations on part b therapy charges per beneficiary per year  iii a reduction in part b therapy costs for the period from january  through july   at which time reimbursement for these services became based on fee schedules established by the health care financing administration hcfa of the department of health and human services hhs  iv development of new medicare and medicaid health plan options  v creation of additional safeguards against healthcare fraud and abuse  and vi repeal of the medicaid boren amendment payment standard 
the legislation also included new opportunities for providers to focus further on patient outcomes by creating alternative patient delivery structures 
pps  which became effective for the company on january   significantly changed the manner in which its skilled nursing facilities are paid for inpatient services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
in year one for the company  medicare pps rates were based on facility specific medicare costs as adjusted for inflation and was federally determined based upon the acuity level as measured by which one of resource utilization grouping rug categories a particular patient is classified of medicare patients served in the company s skilled nursing facilities 
the direct impact of pps and other provisions of the act was a decrease in the company s net operating revenues of approximately  as compared to unless a nursing facility provider chooses to be reimbursed at of the federally determined acuity adjusted rate as allowed under bbra as discussed below i in year two  medicare pps rates will be based on facility specific costs as adjusted for inflation and on the federally determined acuity adjusted rate  ii in year three  medicare pps rates will be based on facility specific costs as adjusted for inflation and on the federally determined acuity adjusted rate  and iii in year four and thereafter  medicare pps rates will be based entirely on the federally determined acuity adjusted rate 
in november  the president signed into law the balanced budget refinement act of bbra which refines the act and will restore approximately billion in medicare funding for skilled nursing providers over the next three years 
the provisions of bbra include i the option for a skilled nursing provider to choose between the higher of current law  as described above  or of the federally determined acuity adjusted rate effective for cost reporting periods starting on or after january   ii a temporary increase of in the federal adjusted per diem rates for rug categories covering extensive services  special care  clinically complex  and high and medium rehabilitation  for the period from april  through september   at which time  if hcfa has not recalculated the necessary refinements to the overall rug iii system  the increase will be extended until such time as the calculations are completed  iii a increase in the federal adjusted per diem rates for all rug categories for each of the periods october  through september  and october  through september   iv a two year moratorium on implementing the two part b  therapy limitations contained in the act  effective january  through january   v a retroactive provision that corrects a technical error in the act denying payment of part b services to skilled nursing facilities participating in pps demonstration projects  and vi exclusion from the medicare pps rates of ambulance services to and from dialysis  prosthetic devices  radioisotopes and chemotherapy furnished on or after april  the company has elected to move to a federally determined acuity adjusted rate on approximately of its nursing facilities effective january  the company currently estimates an increase in its net operating revenues of approximately  related to the impact of bbra however  no assurances can be given as to what the actual impact of bbra will be on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  future federal budget legislation and federal and state regulatory changes  including refinements to the rug iii system expected from hcfa by october   may negatively impact the company 
the company s future operating performance will continue to be affected by the issues facing the long term healthcare industry as a whole  including the maintenance of occupancy  its ability to continue to expand higher margin businesses  the availability of nursing  therapy and other personnel  the adequacy of funding of governmental reimbursement programs  the rising cost of patient care liabilities  the demand for nursing home care and the nature of any additional healthcare reform measures that may be taken by the federal government  as well as by any state governments 
the company s ability to control costs  including its wages and related expenses which continue to rise and represent the largest component of the company s operating and administrative expenses  will also significantly impact its future operating results 
patient care liabilities general liability and professional liability costs for the long term care industry  especially in the state of florida  have become increasingly expensive and unpredictable 
the company and most of its competitors have experienced increases in both the number of claims and the size of the typical claim 
this phenomenon is most evident in the state of florida  where well intended patient rights statutes tend to be exploited by plaintiffs attorneys  since the statutes allow for actual damages  punitive damages and plaintiff attorney fees to be included in any proven violation 
statistics show that florida long term care providers i incur three times the number of general liability claims as compared to the rest of the country  ii have general liability claims that are approximately higher in cost than the rest of the country  and iii incur of the cost for general liability claims for the country  but only represent approximately of the total nursing facility beds 
insurance companies are exiting the state of florida  or severely restricting their capacity to write long term care general liability insurance  since they cannot provide coverage when faced with the magnitude of losses and the explosive growth of claims 
although the company s overall general liability costs per bed in florida are lower than the industry average in florida  these costs are still severely out of line with the rest of the country and continue to escalate 
the company s provision for insurance and related items decreased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  primarily due to a loss portfolio transfer transaction that significantly increased insurance costs during the fourth quarter of despite such decrease year over year  the company  as well as other nursing home providers with significant operations in florida  are experiencing substantial increases in patient care and other claims  evidencing the negative trend surrounding patient care liabilities 
the company is taking an active role in lobbying efforts to reform tort laws in the state of florida 
in addition  community outreach programs are being used to communicate care levels and caregiver dedication in each of its facilities 
there is significant media and legislative attention currently being placed on these issues  and the company is hopeful that there will be certain reforms made in the current statutes 
however  there can be no assurances made that legislative changes will be made  or that any such changes will have a positive impact on the current trend 
year remediation in  the company began a major systems initiative to upgrade or replace all of its integrated financial application software to facilitate the adoption of a new standard chart of accounts 
as part of that major initiative  the company took the necessary steps to upgrade or replace the applications with year compliant releases of the software whenever possible 
for those purchased software applications where the year release was not available  the upgrades to the compliant releases were addressed as part of the year project the yk project 
the company utilized both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total amount expended on the yk project was approximately   expensed and  capitalized for new systems and equipment 
the company does not expect to incur material expenditures in the future related to the year issue 
the company did not experience any disruptions in  or failures of  normal business activities attributable to the year issue and does not anticipate any such disruptions in the future

the provisions of the settlements were consistent with the company s expectations as previously reported and included the planned disposition of nursing facilities operated by a single subsidiary of the company  which will continue to operate and staff the nursing facilities until new operators are found 
under the civil settlement agreement  the company will reimburse the federal government  as follows i  which was paid during the first quarter of  and ii  to be withheld from the company s biweekly medicare periodic interim payments in equal installments over eight years 
because this obligation does not bear interest  the company is required to impute interest over the eight year period
