item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were organized in as a unit of celanese corporation  a chemical company 
our initial mandate was to apply biotechnology to the production of fine and specialty chemicals 
following the merger of celanese corporation with american hoechst corporation  we were spun off as an independent company 
in july  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and commenced the development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
we discontinued the biotreatment operations in to focus on our targeted small molecule cancer and immunology compound development programs and our biocatalytic chiral chemistry program 
since  our revenues have been generated primarily through research and development relating to  and supply of  chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and  to a lesser degree  from agrochemical research and development contracts 
however  as we developed our cancer and immunology programs  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus 
accordingly  on january   we completed the sale of our chiral intermediate business to cambrex corporation for million 
the terms of the sale provided for a payment of million at closing and an additional amount of future royalties not to exceed the net present value on the date of contract of million  with a guarantee of certain minimum payments beginning in the third year after closing 
in late september  we commenced sales of our first commercial product  thalomid 
we have sustained losses in each year since our inception in in  we had a net loss of million and at december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further commercialize and develop thalomid  develop our oncology and immunology programs and expand our chiral business 
based on these expenditures  it is likely that losses will continue for at least the next six months 
subject to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe that there are significant market opportunities for the products and processes under development by us 
to address these opportunities in a timely and effective manner  we intend to seek out collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties 
we have entered into agreements covering the manufacture and distribution for us of certain compounds  such as thalomid  and the development by us of processes for producing chirally pure crop protection agents for license to agrochemical manufacturers 
this development is performed through celgro corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary 
we have established a commercial organization to sell thalomid and we currently employ persons in this capacity 
we intend to develop and market our own pharmaceuticals for indications with accessible patient populations 
for drugs with indications for larger patient populations  we anticipate partnering with other pharmaceutical companies 
we also anticipate partnering with companies for the development and commercialization of our chirally pure pharmaceutical and agrochemical products 
we expect that these arrangements typically will include milestone payments  reimbursement of research and development expenses and royalty arrangements 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones and our ability to control costs 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenues 
total revenues in increased significantly to approximately million from million in the increase resulted from our first full year of product sales of thalomid in of approximately million compared with million of thalomid sales in the sales of thalomid reflected only a partial year of sales  starting from the launch date at the end of the third quarter 
revenue from research contracts increased to million in from  in and included a milestone payment of  related to attenade 
the revenues increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this was due to product sales of approximately million of thalomid which was approved in by the fda and a decrease in research contracts of approximately 
million due to completion of a contract at the end of with a major agrochemical company 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in was approximately million compared with approximately  in the cost of goods sold in both years does not reflect raw material or formulation and encapsulation costs of thalomid  as these costs were charged as research and development expenses prior to receiving fda approval 
there was no cost of goods sold in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were slightly lower at approximately million compared with approximately million in increased spending for clinical trials  primarily for attenade  was offset by a decrease in regulatory consulting fees  university research program spending  and spending for thalomid capsules which was charged as research and development expense prior to receiving fda approval in july of research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million for the our chiral pharmaceutical program primarily for clinical trials and preclinical toxicology studies and approximately  relating to the our immunotherapeutic program  primarily for clinical trials for potential new nda filings for thalomid 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by over  from approximately million to approximately million 
the increase was primarily in sales and marketing expenses  approximately million  warehousing and distribution expenses  approximately million  and expenditures relating to medical affairs and drug safety costs  approximately  all to support the commercialization and distribution of thalomid 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this was primarily due to sales and marketing expenses  million  in anticipation of the thalomid product launch as well as post launch selling activities 
other increases were primarily related to the necessary infrastructure costs required to support the commercial operations including medical affairs and drug safety costs of  information systems development cost and additional finance personnel   and other administrative expenses such as legal  consulting and investor relations of approximately  interest income and interest expense 
interest income for of  was slightly down from  in as average cash balances were approximately the same in both years 
interest income for increased by to approximately  from approximately  in the increase was due to higher average cash balances in interest expense in was significantly higher than  at approximately million compared with approximately  in the higher interest expense resulted from the interest on the three convertible notes which were issued in september  january and july interest expense for increased to approximately  from  due primarily to the interest expenses associated with the convertible notes issued in september loss from continuing operations 
the loss from continuing operations decreased in compared with  to approximately million from approximately million 
the decreased loss resulted from the higher gross profit on thalomid sales and an income tax benefit of million from the sale of a portion of our new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards  offset by increased selling  general and administrative costs and higher interest expense 
the loss from continuing operations increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the increase was due primarily to spending related to the launch of thalomid and ongoing research programs in chiral pharmaceuticals and immunotherapeutics as described above 
loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations decreased to  in from  in due to the fact that the chiral intermediate business was sold in early january the company recorded a gain on the sale of the chiral intermediate assets of approximately million in liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our working capital requirements primarily through private and public sales of our debt and equity securities  income earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of such securities  and revenues from research contracts and product sales 
as of december   we have raised approximately million in net proceeds from three public and three private offerings  including our initial public offering in july we also issued convertible notes in september  january  and july with net proceeds aggregating approximately million 
our net working capital at december  increased significantly to approximately million primarily cash and cash equivalents from approximately million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to the cash received from the issuance of the convertible notes in and as well as collection of receivables on sales of thalomid 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million in while marketable securities increased by million from this reflects the receipt of funds from the issuance of the convertible notes and collection of receivables from sales of thalomid 
we expect that our rate of spending will increase as the result of increased clinical trial costs  increased expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products currently in development  increased costs related to the commercialization of thalomid and increased working capital requirements 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
proceeds from the transaction net of expenses  were approximately million 
these funds plus the increasing revenues from sales of thalomid should fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements  including the recognition of non refundable fees received upon entering into arrangements 
we are in the process of evaluating this sab and the effect it will have on our future consolidated financial statements and future revenue recognition policy
