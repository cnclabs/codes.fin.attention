item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company is the largest producer of oriented polypropylene opp films in north america 
consumer product companies worldwide use aet s opp films in labeling  packaging and overwrap applications that often require special attributes such as high gloss  vivid graphics  exceptional clarity and barriers to moisture  light and air to preserve freshness 
the company generally sells its film products to converters  which are companies specializing in processes such as laminating multiple films or other materials together and printing graphics and text to form the final label or packaging material for end users 
for the purposes of the discussion that follows  the fiscal years ended september   and are referred to as  and  respectively 
all dollar amounts are in thousands 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of the company s sales represented by certain income and expense items in its income statements years ended september sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating profit loss interest expense  net net loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales for fiscal of  were  or percent higher than sales of  due to a percent increase in opp films sales volume combined with higher average selling prices 
fiscal represents the first year since where average selling prices increased  as the industry began passing on a portion of higher raw material costs and industry overcapacity continued to ease 
average annual opp films industry demand growth of approximately percent continued to absorb excess industry capacity and should encourage more favorable pricing beginning in sales outside the united states comprised percent of total sales  and operating profit for sales outside the united states was percent of total operating profit 
excluding temporary plant shutdown costs  gross profit for was  an increase of  or percent from the level of  while gross margin declined from percent of sales to percent of sales due to significantly higher raw material costs 
the cost of polypropylene resin  the company s primary raw material  rose unexpectedly as a result of the dramatic increase in the price of crude oil 
polypropylene resin prices increased over percent in the past twelve months and percent in the past eighteen months  and only a small portion of these resin cost increases were successfully passed on to the company s customers in the form of price increases  due to the excess capacity that still existed in the opp films industry 
the company held firm on a recent price increase  losing some sales volume 
therefore  the company shut down all opp films operations for one week in september  resulting in million of unabsorbed fixed costs incurred in the quarter 
research and development expense decreased by to  or percent of sales in  due primarily to differences in timing of research and development spending between and the continued development and commercialization of high end films is core to the company s strategy  and the company intends to continue investing approximately to percent of sales in research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  in represented percent of sales compared with  or percent of sales in as the company held operating expenses to relatively constant levels despite significant increases in volume manufactured and sold during the year 
this resulted in a percent increase in operating profit from to net interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates on the credit facility in income tax as a percentage of before tax income was percent for and percent for the lower percentage reflects the benefit of tax planning and is expected to remain at this level for at least the next two years 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales for of  were  or percent lower than sales of  due to the divestiture of certain non core businesses in the third quarter of adjusted for these divestitures  sales increased in fiscal by  or percent  as compared with fiscal  as a result of opp films unit volume growth of percent  offset in part by significantly lower average selling prices compared with due to industry overcapacity 
demand for opp films continued to grow  but industry overcapacity continued to exist in the marketplace 
sales outside the united states comprised percent of total sales  and operating profit for sales outside the united states was percent of total operating profit 
gross profit for was  or percent of sales  exclusive of  in plant shutdown costs 
gross profit increased  or percent from the level of  or percent of sales  adjusted for the aforementioned divestitures 
despite a dramatic decline in selling prices due to industry overcapacity  gross margin increased due to extensive productivity improvement programs and continuing improvement in sales mix brought about by the effectiveness of the research and development and sales efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for from  in  an increase of  reflecting the company s investment in expanded sales reach and the infrastructure necessary to handle over percent more capacity 
during the first fiscal quarter of  the company terminated acquisition discussions with two of the largest european based worldwide opp films producers 
we were unable to reach a mutually agreeable price at which the company would acquire either of these businesses  given the deterioration in the european opp films market caused by the major industry wide overcapacity in that region 
costs associated with both of these acquisition projects and related due diligence efforts were  or  after taxes  and were recorded as non operating expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced a restructuring of its covington  virginia manufacturing operation  including the shutdown of two older  less efficient production lines and the elimination of approximately full time manufacturing and plant administrative positions  of which were hourly and the remainder of which were salaried 
the company recorded an  charge in the fourth quarter of for this restructuring  comprised of approximately  for costs associated with operating leases related to idled equipment   of severance related costs and  in other charges  primarily related to idling the equipment 
implementation of this plan targeted eliminating a total of positions and the shutdown of the production lines 
during the company paid out on leases related to idled equipment   in severance related costs and  in other restructuring costs  resulting in an accrued restructuring balance of  at september  of this balance   represents lease costs  the majority of which are classified as long term liabilities 
all aspects of the plan were completed early in fiscal net interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily as a result of interest capitalized in associated with a capacity expansion project which was completed in march income tax as a percentage of before tax income or loss remained constant for and liquidity and capital resources aet maintains a credit agreement with a group of lenders to provide bank financing 
this credit agreement  as amended and restated  is a  revolving credit facility the credit facility with a final maturity on the earlier of i november   if the aet senior notes are not refinanced prior to such date  or ii january  the credit facility is secured by all the assets of aet 
it includes covenants which limit borrowings based on certain asset levels  require aet to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and specified interest coverage and leverage ratios  restrict payment of cash dividends to stockholders  and establish maximum capital expenditure levels 
it also contains other covenants customary in transactions of this type 
at september   aet had  outstanding under its credit facility and another  in letters of credit  leaving  available for borrowing 
the company also has  of revenue bonds outstanding  which are due november  on september   the company and its banks amended the credit facility  increasing the total amount available for borrowing from  to  and modifying certain covenant requirements 
the company plans to refinance the  senior notes which mature on april   in the latter half of fiscal or early fiscal if the notes are not refinanced by november   the  credit facility matures 
otherwise  the credit facility matures on january  an inability to refinance the senior notes prior to november  would have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition and liquidity of the company in fiscal operating activities in used  in cash  which was the result of  of net income before depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenditures  and a  net increase in other working capital items 
the net increase in working capital resulted primarily from a  increase in inventory  an  increase in accounts receivable  a  increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  interest paid during amounted to  including capitalized interest 
additions to property  plant and equipment were  and were funded in part by borrowings under the credit facility  with the balance funded by available cash flow 
inflation management regularly reviews the prices charged for its products 
when market conditions allow  price adjustments are made to reflect changes in demand or product costs due to fluctuations in the cost of materials  labor and inflation 
the costs of raw materials make up a significant portion of aet s costs and have historically fluctuated 
there can be no assurance  however  that future market conditions will support any correlation between raw material cost fluctuations and finished product films pricing  as evidenced by the market dynamics in the second half of fiscal when the price of polypropylene resin significantly increased due to the rising price of crude oil 
during that period  aet was only able to pass on a portion of the cost increase to customers due to overcapacity in the opp films market 
seasonal nature of certain opp markets certain of the end use markets for the company s opp films are seasonal 
for example  demand in the snack food  soft drink and candy markets is generally higher in the spring and summer 
as a result  sales and net income are generally higher in those periods  although actual results can be influenced by numerous factors  such as raw material costs  competitive prices and other matters discussed in this report 
new accounting pronouncements information related to new accounting pronouncements is included in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks related to the timely development and acceptance of new products  fluctuations in raw materials and other production costs  the loss of one or more significant customers  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the timely completion of capital projects  the success of the company s efforts to access capital markets on satisfactory terms  and to acquire  integrate and operate new businesses and expand into new markets  as well as other risks detailed in exhibit of the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission

short term and long term debt the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements  while long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at september   the company had no short term debt outstanding and had long term debt outstanding of  million  of which million was outstanding on its revolving credit facility which has a variable interest rate  based on either libor or prime rates
