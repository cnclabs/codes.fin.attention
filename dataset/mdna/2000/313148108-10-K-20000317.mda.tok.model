overview was a year of solid growth and strong financial performance for farmer mac  notwithstanding challenges brought about by the natural cycle of the economics of agriculture and the lessening of mortgage placement activity due to rising interest rates 
diluted earnings per share were for  a percent increase over diluted earnings per share on a fully taxable equivalent basis  marking the fourth consecutive year during which farmer mac achieved significant increases in profitability 
for the same period  net income on a fully taxable equivalent basis rose from million in to million in the year s record earnings were driven by a percent increase in the amount of loans purchased and guaranteed by farmer mac  to billion 
that volume increase was largely attributable to greater use of swap and long term standby transactions  which aggregated million by year end 
purchases of loans through the cash window and in farmer mac ii also increased  from million in to million in notwithstanding this  cash window purchases in the latter half of the year were lower than the same period a year earlier  reflecting the dampening effect upon new mortgage demand of rising interest rates and the wait and see attitude of farmers  brought about by commodity price volatility and delays in government agricultural program changes 
recently introduced products  such as the long term standby purchase commitment and part time farm loans  enabled farmer mac to continue to enlarge its base of active program users in all sectors of the agricultural mortgage industry during  thereby expanding its service to farmers and ranchers 
as a simpler alternative to swaps  long term standby purchase commitments expand opportunities for lenders who customarily hold loans in portfolio  notably farm credit system institutions  to obtain the capital and diversification benefits of the farmer mac guarantee 
expansion of the part time farm program prompted interest in farmer mac among mortgage bankers and other national and regional lenders  thereby substantially increasing the number of lending outlets offering our products 
this made farmer mac loans more accessible to farmers  ranchers and rural residents in all regions of the nation and positioned the corporation for growth in and beyond 
the increase in business volume lifted total revenues by percent during the principal factors contributing to higher revenues were net interest income from spread on portfolio retention of cash window purchases  and guarantee fees on the higher cumulative amount of guarantees outstanding 
net interest income was up million  from million in to million in  as farmer mac guaranteed securities and loans held by farmer mac increased by million  guarantee fee income grew percent to million  as outstanding guarantees increased by percent to billion 
during the same period  operating expenses increased by only percent 
the quality of mortgages covered by farmer mac s guarantee remained good  despite continued stress in some segments of the us agricultural economy in at year end  farmer mac i loans purchased or guaranteed after changes to our statutory charter in placed farmer mac in the position of first loss guarantor post act loans showed a modest increase in delinquency rates of days or longer  to percent of the principal amount of all post act loans  compared to percent at the end of external percent first loss interests mitigate farmer mac s credit exposure to pre act loans 
farmer mac anticipates fluctuations in the delinquency rate from quarter to quarter  with higher levels likely in the first and third quarters of each year  due to the semiannual payment characteristics of most farmer mac loans 
although farmer mac experienced loan losses resulting in net charge offs to the reserve for the first time ever in  with losses totaling thousand  that amount was well within loss reserves  which totaled million at the end of the year 
it is anticipated that delinquencies may increase again in  due to both the aging of the guarantee portfolio and pressures on farm profits due to soft worldwide demand for core agricultural commodities 
nevertheless  based on united states department of agriculture usda or the department reports of strong agricultural income figures for  evidence of continuing strength in agricultural land values in most regions of the country  and anticipated federal financial support for agricultural producers again in  farmer mac believes overall agricultural mortgage credit quality will be good and there will be sound business development opportunities in a considerable number of the opportunities will likely come from swap and long term standby transactions  as lenders become more attentive to issues of liquidity and portfolio diversification 
in addition to growth in profitability and business volume  other significant developments in included o in june  farmer mac s class a and class c common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange and  in july  farmer mac announced a three for one stock split of its class c stock 
the class c common stock split and the concurrent stockholder approved elimination of the previous three to one dividend and liquidation preferences applicable to the class c stock were effective on august  and simplified the reporting of earnings per share 
o in november  the fca issued a proposed risk based capital regulation for farmer mac 
the public comment period on the proposed rule ends on june  the proposed risk based capital rule and stress test computer model is currently under review by farmer mac and other interested parties  and our evaluation of the stress test has already identified several specific issues for comment 
while we cannot predict when and how the proposed risk based capital regulations will affect farmer mac  the fca has stated that the corporation s capital level currently exceeds both the statutory minimum capital and the proposed risk based capital requirements 
as we continue to advance farmer mac s business in and beyond  certain factors and conditions remain likely to constrain our progress 
many institutions that dominate agricultural lending today have an organizational bias toward retaining loans in portfolio rather than selling them  notwithstanding corporate finance and capital planning benefits they might realize through participation in farmer mac s programs 
some lending institutions subsidize their agricultural mortgage loan rates by price averaging with non mortgage loans  or by low return use of equity  both of which reduce the relative competitiveness of farmer mac s loan rates 
although farmer mac has grown steadily stronger during the last four years  that growth has depended  and will continue to depend  upon ongoing increases in the volume of loans covered by its guarantee 
farmer mac s current share of the agricultural mortgage market remains relatively small  due to the gradual nature of market penetration in a mature market 
based upon our dramatic growth rates in the years since  this implies a significant ongoing opportunity for expansion of business volume 
over the long term  our strategy for realizing farmer mac s business development and profitability goals is to prompt agricultural mortgage lenders  be they traditional or non traditional  to continue to expand their use of our guarantee through market oriented programs and products that clearly benefit the nation s farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners

net interest yield remained unchanged in  averaging percent in both and net interest income totaled million in the million increase from to was due to growth in the average balance of interest earning assets and a basis point increase in net interest yield 
the increase in the balance of interest earning assets was due to an increase in non program assets as a result of farmer mac s expanded debt issuance program begun in early  and an increase in program assets as a result of retention of loans purchased through the farmer mac i cash window during the later half of the increase in net interest yield was attributable to the increase in the average balance of non interest bearing funding as a result of the million stock issuance that occurred in late other income 
other income  which is comprised of guarantee fee income  gain on issuance of ambs and miscellaneous income  totaled million for  compared to million for during  total outstanding guarantees increased by percent 
similarly  guarantee fee income  the largest component of other income  increased to million from million the prior year  an increase of percent

miscellaneous income totaled thousand for  compared to thousand for miscellaneous income includes fees and hedging gains and losses related to program activities  which will fluctuate from period to period due to various factors including the level of program activity and delinquencies 
other income increased slightly from million in to million in  as an increase in guarantee fee income was largely offset by a decrease in gain on sale of ambs 
guarantee fee income increased from million in to million in due to a corresponding increase in the outstanding balance of guaranteed securities

income tax expense totaled million in  compared to an expense of thousand in and a benefit of thousand in during and  farmer mac recognized million and million  respectively  of previously unrecognized tax benefits  which related primarily to net operating losses incurred in prior years 
excluding previously deferred tax benefits  farmer mac would have reported income tax expense of million and million and net income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of million and million for and  respectively 
farmer mac expects its effective tax rate in to approximate percent due to the effects of non deductible expenses and a higher statutory tax rate applicable to higher levels of income

business volume 
the following table sets forth information regarding the volume and balance of loans purchased or guaranteed by farmer mac for the periods indicated in thousands purchase and guarantee volume farmer mac i cash window    swap transactions   ltspc  total farmer mac i volume    farmer mac ii    total loans purchased or guaranteed    ambs issuances retained   sold   swap transactions   total ambs issuances    outstanding balance of loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac at december    during  the volume of loans purchased or guaranteed by farmer mac increased percent  bringing the outstanding balance of loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac to billion 
the increase in loan volume was driven by swaps and long term standby purchase commitments ltspc see risk management credit risk management for a description of ltspc  which totaled million during swaps and ltspc typically involve seasoned loans  while cash window transactions usually represent acquisitions of newly originated loans 
although cash window purchases increased during the year  purchase volume in the later half of decreased compared to the same period in as a result of rising interest rates and economic stress in the agricultural sector  which has reduced agricultural mortgage demand 
during  farmer mac issued million of ambs  most of which were retained by farmer mac in contrast to and when most or all ambs were sold to capital market investors 
the decrease in ambs sold to capital market investors  and corresponding increase in retained ambs  was due to market conditions that have favored retention of ambs 
indicators of future purchase and guarantee volume  particularly cash window activity  include outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i loans and the total balance of loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased 
most purchase commitments entered into by farmer mac are mandatory delivery commitments 
if a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver the loans required thereunder within the specified time period  farmer mac requires the seller to pay a fee to extend or cancel the commitment 
at december   outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i loans totaled million  compared to million at december   while loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled million at december   compared to million at december  not all of these loans are purchased  as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller 
while significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market for agricultural mortgages  farmer mac continues to face the challenges of establishing a new market where none previously existed 
acceptance of farmer mac s programs is increasing among lenders  reflecting the competitive rates  terms and products offered and the advantages farmer mac believes its programs provide 
for farmer mac to succeed in realizing its business development and profitability goals over the longer term  agricultural mortgage lenders  whether traditional or non traditional  must continue expanding their use of farmer mac s programs and products 
balance sheet review assets 
at december   total assets were billion compared to billion at december  the increase in total assets was primarily due to growth in program assets  which increased million during to a total of billion 
during  farmer mac purchased million of farmer mac i and ii loans and purchased million of ambs from capital market investors 
during the same period  non program assets were unchanged  totaling billion at december  and the remaining growth in total assets was due to increases in the balance of interest and guarantee fees receivable  which increased in proportion to the growth of program assets and total guarantees  and prepaid expenses and other assets 
prepaid expenses and other assets grew by million due to i capital expenditures to enhance farmer mac s risk management systems  ii an increase in the deferred tax assets balance as a result of growth in the reserve for losses and the change in the unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale see note to the financial statements  and iii growth in medium term note issuance costs  which are classified as other assets  as a result of increased issuances of longer term debt to fund retention of ambs 
other assets also included property acquired through foreclosure real estate owned or reo  which totaled million at december  there was no reo at december  liabilities 
total liabilities increased from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase in liabilities was primarily due to growth in notes payable  which corresponded to the growth in on balance sheet program assets 
the remaining increase in total liabilities was due to increases in accrued interest payable  as a result of the increase in outstanding notes payable  and the reserve for losses see risk management credit risk management

capital 
at december   stockholders equity totaled million  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to net income earned during at december  and december   farmer mac s regulatory required minimum capital was million and million  compared with actual regulatory capital of million and million  respectively see liquidity and capital resources capital requirements 
off balance sheet guarantees 
at december   outstanding off balance sheet guarantees totaled billion  compared to million at december  for further information regarding off balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities  see risk management credit risk management 
risk management interest rate risk management 
interest rate risk is the risk that interest rate changes could materially affect the value  or future earnings  of farmer mac 
farmer mac is exposed to two primary sources of interest rate risk a farmer mac i and ii securities and other assets held for investment  and b loans 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets held for investment because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities 
this risk is primarily related to farmer mac i and ii securities because of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities thereby increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches 
cash flow mismatches in a changing rate environment can reduce the value or earnings of the corporation if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower yielding investments when farmer mac s funding costs cannot be correspondingly reduced  or if assets repay more slowly than expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher cost debt 
yield maintenance provisions associated with many of the loans underlying farmer mac i securities reduce  but do not eliminate  this risk 
yield maintenance provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment to farmer mac when they prepay their loans 
this payment is calculated such that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  it should generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not been prepaid 
none of the loans underlying farmer mac ii securities have yield maintenance provisions 
fixed rate loans without yield maintenance provisions represented percent of the total balance of loans underlying on balance sheet farmer mac i and ii securities at december there is less interest rate risk related to farmer mac s portfolio of non program assets because it consists entirely of investments that mature or reprice within one year 
however  farmer mac does invest in certain adjustable rate investments that limit or cap the amount the investment coupon rate can increase 
such capped investments totaled million at december farmer mac s primary strategy to manage interest rate risk related to farmer mac i and ii securities and other assets held for investment is to fund them with liabilities that have similar durations  or average cash flow patterns over time  and provide flexibility to accommodate changing prepayment rates in changing interest rate environments 
to achieve the desired funding objective  farmer mac uses a mix of short term discount notes and callable and non callable medium term notes see note to the financial statements 
by using a mix of liabilities that includes callable debt  the duration of the liabilities will tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the duration of the assets the rate of change in the duration of an asset or liability to a change in interest rates is referred to as convexity 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to capped adjustable rate investments by purchasing interest rate contracts that effectively uncap the investments see note to the financial statements 
farmer mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans  including loans committed to be  but not yet  purchased 
when farmer mac commits to purchase a qualified loan  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loan and the time it either a sells ambs backed by the loan  or b issues debt to retain the loan in its portfolio although issuing debt to fund the loans as an investment does not fully mitigate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities  as discussed above 
as of december   the balance of loans committed or purchased and not yet sold or funded as retained investments totaled million 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans  and the debt to be issued to fund the loans as retained investments  through the use of forward sale contracts involving gse debt securities and futures contracts involving us treasury securities 
at december   the total notional balance of gse forward sale contracts and treasury futures contracts was million and million  respectively 
farmer mac primarily uses gse forward sale contracts since such instruments reduce farmer mac s interest rate exposure to changes in both treasury rates and ambs and debt spreads 
for further information regarding off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  see note to the financial statements 
farmer mac has established policies and implemented interest rate risk management procedures to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk 
the primary methodology used by management to monitor farmer mac s interest rate risk exposure is measuring the sensitivity of farmer mac s market value of equity mve to changes in interest rates 
this and other risk measures are reviewed regularly by management s asset liability committee and the finance committee of the board of directors to ensure compliance with farmer mac s interest rate risk policy limits 
the simulation of mve involves generating multiple paths for future interest rates starting from a base yield curve and then discounting the estimated cash flows under those rate paths to arrive at the estimated fair value of farmer mac s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
farmer mac uses a commercially developed model to perform the mve analyses 
the analysis  which is based on farmer mac s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments  and does not assume any new business  measures the change in mve under seven interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate scenarios include a base case in which the base yield curve is equal to the current yield curve  and six parallel and instantaneous shocks to the base yield curve plus and minus  and basis points 
inherent in the mve sensitivity analysis presented is the assumption that interest rate changes occur as instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve  in reality  such shifts are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
in addition  actual future market conditions may differ materially from those assumed in the analysis 
for example  actual loan prepayments and farmer mac ambs and debt spreads may differ significantly from those assumed in the analysis 
accordingly  the results of the mve sensitivity analysis should not be viewed as a projection of future results 
the following schedule summarizes the results of farmer mac s mve sensitivity analysis at december  and percentage change in mve from base case december  interest rate scenario bp bp bp bp bp bp at december   farmer mac was in compliance with established policy limits for interest rate risk 
credit risk management 
farmer mac s primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages 
farmer mac is exposed to credit risk on loans it holds  as well as on loans backing securities issued to third parties because of farmer mac s guarantee of the timely payment of principal  including any balloon payments  and interest on the securities 
farmer mac is also exposed to credit risk on loans it has committed to purchase through ltspc transactions 
the ltspc transaction  which is a variation on a swap transaction  permits a lender to segregate a pool of loans in its portfolio and transfer the credit risk on those loans to farmer mac  in return for the payment to farmer mac of fees on the outstanding balance of the segregated loans approximating what would have been farmer mac s guarantee fee had the loans been exchanged with farmer mac in a swap transaction 
loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac can be divided into three groups a pre act farmer mac i loans  b post act farmer mac i loans  and c farmer mac ii loans 
for pre act loans  farmer mac s credit risk exposure is mitigated by subordinated interests 
before farmer mac incurs a credit loss  full recourse must first be taken against the subordinated interest 
the act eliminated the subordinated interest requirement 
as a result  farmer mac assumes percent of the credit risk on post act farmer mac i loans 
farmer mac mitigates the credit risk related to pre and post act loans through the application of its underwriting and appraisal standards and by requiring collateral in the form of the real estate see business farmer mac i underwriting and appraisal standards 
in response to the increased credit risk related to post act loans  farmer mac increased the guarantee fee rate and lowered the loan to value requirements for post act loans relative to those previously required for pre act loans 
farmer mac s credit exposure on farmer mac ii loans is covered by the full faith and credit of the united states by virtue of the usda guarantee of the principal and interest on all guaranteed portions 
farmer mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure to pre act farmer mac i loans because of the subordinated interests  or to farmer mac ii loans because of the usda guarantee 
the outstanding principal balance of loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac is summarized in the table below 
december  in thousands farmer mac i loans post act   pre act   farmer mac ii loans   farmer mac continually assesses its credit risk exposure related to post act farmer mac i loans by monitoring agricultural economic conditions and evaluating the credit quality of those loans 
despite adverse trends in agricultural economic conditions in and continuing into  particularly low commodity prices  reduced export demand and weather related problems in certain areas of the country  farmer mac believes that the credit quality of the post act farmer mac i loans remains good  based on farmer mac s credit underwriting  appraisal and diversification standards 
farmer mac s diversification standards limit its credit exposure in a particular geographic region or commodity to a percentage of the total principal amount of all loans outstanding  considering the credit quality of the loans in that particular geographic region or commodity group based on the borrower s loan to value  debt service coverage  equity to asset and working capital to current asset ratios 
the following tables set forth the loan to value based on current loan balance  geographic and commodity distributions of the post act farmer mac i loans as of december  and for information regarding loan to value  commodity and geographic distributions of all farmer mac i loans  see note to the financial statements 
distribution of post act loans at december  by original loan to value ratio to to to to to to total weighted average loan to value ratio by geographic region mid north mid south northeast northwest southeast southwest total by commodity crops livestock permanent plantings part time farms total regions are defined in note to the financial statements 
as of december   farmer mac s highest geographic concentration was in the northwest region as a result of several guarantee transactions involving seasoned loans 
this loan concentration is mitigated by the lower loan to value ratios associated with the loans in those transactions 
the weighted average loan to value ratio based on current loan balance of all outstanding loans from the northwest region at december  was approximately percent 
farmer mac s largest commodity concentration at december  was crops  however this group consists of several specific commodities  including cotton  feed grains  vegetables and other crops  none of which comprised more than percent of the total portfolio 
the effectiveness of farmer mac s underwriting  appraisal and diversification standards is reflected primarily through the level of defaulted loans and related credit losses 
at december   post act farmer mac i loans that were days or more past due referred to as non performing or impaired loans totaled million  or percent of the total principal amount of all post act loans 
the balance of non performing loans at december  was million  or percent of all post act loans 
the increase in the delinquency rate of the post act farmer mac i loans from december  to december  was due to the growing number of loans that are approaching their anticipated peak default years and adverse conditions affecting the agricultural economy 
the following table segregates the post act delinquency rate at december  by year of origination  geographic region and commodity 
post act delinquency rates by year of origination prior to by geographic region mid north mid south northeast northwest southeast southwest by commodity crops livestock permanent plantings part time farms regions are defined in note to the financial statements 
while the billion farm disaster package enacted by congress last fall resulted in high levels of farm income during and agricultural land values remained stable  low commodity prices and weak demand for us agricultural products are projected to continue through farmer mac anticipates that delinquencies may increase again in due to both the growing number of loans held or securitized by farmer mac that are gradually approaching their anticipated peak default years and the continuing stress expected in the agricultural economy  unless there is further federal support for farmers 
nevertheless  based on strong agricultural income figures reported by the us department of agriculture for  continued strong agricultural land values in most regions of the country and anticipated federal financial support for agricultural producers again in  farmer mac believes that overall credit quality and sound business development opportunities remain strong 
the primary determinant of the loss that may be incurred on non performing loans is loan to value 
the following table illustrates the distribution of non performing loans at december  by loan to value based on current loan balance and appraised value at the date of initial guarantee by farmer mac distribution of post act delinquencies by loan to value ratio to to to to to total farmer mac maintains a reserve to cover credit losses incurred on post act loans underlying farmer mac i securities and ltspcs 
at december   farmer mac s reserve for loan losses totaled million  compared to million at december  farmer mac s provision for losses was million for  compared to million for during  farmer mac acquired properties through foreclosure resulting in net charge offs to the reserve for losses of thousand 
some of the property was disposed of during  while the other property  which was acquired in december  continued to be held by farmer mac at year end 
the cost basis in the property held by farmer mac at december  was million 
no charge offs were recognized in the reserve as a percentage of outstanding post act farmer mac i loans was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
management evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses on a quarterly basis and considers a number of factors  including historical charge off and recovery activity noting any particular trends in preceding periods  trends in delinquencies  bankruptcies and non performing loans  trends in loan volume and size of credit risks  current and anticipated economic conditions  the condition of agricultural segments and geographic areas experiencing or expected to experience particular economic adversities  particularly areas where farmer mac may have a geographic or commodity concentration  the degree of risk inherent in the composition of the guaranteed portfolio  the results of its quality control reviews  and its underwriting standards 
to a lesser extent  farmer mac is also exposed to institutional credit risk related to i issuers of agvantage bonds and other investments held by farmer mac  ii sellers and servicers  and iii interest rate contract counterparties 
agvantage bonds are general obligations of the agvantage issuers and are secured by collateral in an amount ranging from percent to percent of the bond amount 
in addition to requiring collateral  farmer mac mitigates credit risk related to agvantage bonds by evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of the agvantage issuers 
outstanding agvantage bonds totaled million at december  the credit risk inherent in the investment portfolio is mitigated by farmer mac s policy of investing in highly rated instruments and by establishing concentration limits  which reduce exposure to any one counterparty 
farmer mac s policy limits the dollar amount of investments with one counterparty  excluding government sponsored enterprises gses and agencies of the us government  to the lesser of percent of farmer mac s stockholders equity or million  and requires the counterparty to be rated in one of the three highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization 
as of december   farmer mac had investments comprised of commercial paper  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities outstanding with counterparties totaling million  of which exceeded percent of farmer mac s stockholders equity the cumulative balance of investments to such counterparties totaled million  but no one of which exceeded percent of its stockholders equity 
in addition  at december   farmer mac held million of securities issued by gses or agencies of the us government and million in money market investment accounts  with the maximum amount held in any one money market investment fund at any time during being approximately million 
the short term nature of the investment portfolio also limits its credit risk 
at december   percent of the investment portfolio  excluding gse and agency investments  consisted of short term highly liquid investments 
farmer mac manages institutional credit risk related to sellers and servicers by requiring such institutions to meet certain standards and by monitoring their financial condition and servicing performance 
credit risk related to interest rate contracts is discussed in note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the funding needs of farmer mac s business programs are driven by the purchase of qualified loans  payment of principal and interest on farmer mac guaranteed securities and the maturities of debt 
farmer mac s primary sources of funds to meet these needs are issuances of debt obligations  principal and interest payments on mortgages underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and net operating cash flows 
because of farmer mac s regular participation in the capital markets and its status as a gse  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
farmer mac also maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents  comprised of commercial paper and other short term investments  to draw upon as necessary 
at december  and  farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
capital requirements 
the act  as amended by the act  establishes three capital standards for farmer mac minimum  critical and risk based 
the minimum capital requirement is expressed as a percentage of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations  with the critical capital requirement equal to one half of the minimum capital amount 
higher minimum and critical capital requirements were phased in over a transition period  which ended on january   when the highest level of minimum capital became applicable 
the act does not specify the required level of risk based capital 
it directs the fca to establish a risk based capital test for farmer mac  using stress test parameters set forth therein 
for a discussion of risk based capital  including the potential impact of future risk based capital requirements on farmer mac of regulations currently proposed by the fca  see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards risk based capital 
certain enforcement powers are given to the fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with the capital standards 
see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards enforcement levels 
as of december  and  farmer mac was classified as within level i the highest compliance level 
the following table sets forth farmer mac s minimum capital requirement as of december  and based on the fully phased in requirements
