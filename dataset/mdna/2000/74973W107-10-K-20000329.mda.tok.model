item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following information contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  and are subject to the safe harbor created by that act 
such forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements regarding the future availability and prices of raw materials  competition in the titanium industry  demand for the company s products  the historic cyclicality of the titanium and aerospace industries  uncertain defense spending  long term supply agreements  the ultimate determination of pending trade petitions  global economic conditions  the company s order backlog and the conversion of that backlog into revenue  labor relations  the impact of year compliance  and other statements contained herein that are not historical facts 
because such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these and other risk factors are set forth below in the outlook section  as well as being described in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec over the last months  copies of which are available from the sec or may be obtained upon request from the company 
overview historically  a majority of the us titanium industry s output has been used in aerospace applications 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the fluctuations in performance of companies engaged in the titanium industry 
over the past years  titanium mill products shipments registered a cyclical peak of million pounds in and a low of million pounds in in the last several years  commercial aerospace markets have shown a significant increase in demand although reflected a reduction over prior years while military aerospace markets have stabilized at reduced build rate levels 
in the period  most major commercial airlines reported stronger operating profits and  during this same period  aircraft manufacturers increased build rates 
as of december   the leading manufacturers of commercial aircraft  boeing commercial airplane group and airbus industrie  reported an aggregate of  planes under firm order and deliverable over the next five years 
the comparable backlogs as of december  and were  and  planes  respectively 
the company estimates that total industry shipments of titanium mill products in were million pounds  down from million pounds in because of the ongoing asian financial crisis  production difficulties at its manufacturing facilities and uncertain global economic conditions which affected the demand for commercial aircraft  boeing commercial airplane group has recently made a number of announcements reducing its forecasted production rates on a number of aircraft models in the time frame 
boeing and airbus industrie  through direct purchases and their families of subcontractors  consume the majority of titanium mill products produced for aerospace needs 
these companies and their subcontractors exercise considerable purchasing power in the industry 
aerospace contractors have announced delivery delays and rescheduling resulting from the boeing announcements and  therefore  a need to adjust inventory requirements downward from peak levels 
the reduction of commercial aircraft build rates will impact the overall demand for titanium mill products for at least the next two to three quarters 
based on currently available information  the company anticipates that the us titanium industry s total shipments will decrease in from levels  although  the amount of decrease cannot be accurately predicted 
if worldwide economic conditions cause commercial airlines to cancel or delay aircraft  titanium demand and pricing could come under further pressure 
in recent years  the company has devoted significant resources to developing new markets for titanium in the oil and gas and geothermal energy production industries 
in addition to designing and fabricating the world s first all titanium high pressure drilling riser in  the company has also produced significant quantities of seamless titanium pipe for use in geothermal energy applications 
the company also supplied titanium stress joints for use in a production riser system located in the gulf of mexico 
in an effort to expand on these successes  and reach other offshore application markets  in october the company acquired the assets of weld tech of houston  texas 
weld tech fabricates oil and gas components such as production manifolds  connectors and riser systems used in offshore oil and gas production 
additionally  the company formed a new subsidiary  rti energy systems  inc  which engineers  designs and markets offshore riser systems  stress joints  drill pipe and components 
rti intends to build on its capabilities in these areas 
rti s strategy is to build on its leading position in the worldwide titanium industry while maintaining a strong financial condition and stringent quality  safety and environmental standards 
rti is emphasizing higher margin products in its traditional markets  while continuing to develop new markets and products such as seamless tubulars for oil and gas and geothermal energy production

outlook because of the asian financial crisis  production difficulties at its manufacturing facilities and uncertain global economic conditions which affects the demand for commercial aircraft  boeing commercial airplane group recently made a number of announcements reducing its forecasted production rates on a number of aircraft models in the time frame 
aerospace contractors have announced delivery delays and rescheduling resulting from the boeing announcements and  therefore  a need to adjust inventory requirements downward from peak levels 
the extent or duration of this inventory adjustment period  or the amount of excess inventory in the procurement pipeline is unknown 
the company has experienced some order cancellations  and in addition volume and pricing of incoming orders has shown some softening particularly in forging products such as ingot and bloom 
demand and pricing for the company s core value added products  alloy sheet and plate  while softening somewhat  remain relatively strong 
the reduction of commercial aircraft build rates will impact the overall demand for titanium mill products for at least the next two to three quarters 
however  increased military spending should result in increased military aerospace demand 
based on currently available information  the company anticipates that the us titanium industry s total shipments will decrease in from levels although the amount of decrease cannot be accurately predicted 
if worldwide economic conditions cause commercial airlines to cancel or delay aircraft  titanium demand and pricing could come under further pressure 
on january   rmi entered into an agreement with boeing commercial airplane group whereby rmi would supply boeing and its family of commercial suppliers with up to million pounds of titanium products annually 
the agreement  which began in  has an initial term of five years and  subject to review by the parties in the fourth year  could be extended for an additional five years 
under the accord  boeing receives firm prices in exchange for rmi receiving a minimum volume commitment of million pounds per year 
if volumes drop below the minimum commitment  the contract contains provisions for financial compensation 
in accordance with the agreement rmi presented a demand notice of approximately million to boeing commercial airplane group for such compensation since shipments amounted to only  pounds 
rmi has not yet received any of the proceeds related to this claim  nor has it accrued the effect of the expected revenues 
in another accord  rmi  through its french affiliate  reamet  was chosen by aerospatiale as the major supplier of the titanium flat rolled products required for its airbus programs beginning in and extending through requirements are principally for flat rolled products  including value added cut to size shapes 
during the second quarter of  rmi was designated the sole supplier of titanium mill products for the air force f fighter being built by lockheed martin and boeing 
the new contract began in and will continue through the life of the program with approximately aircraft forecast to be produced by the year revenues over the life of this contract could potentially total million 
rmi was also selected by military aircraft producers boeing and northrop as the principal supplier of titanium alloy plate and alloy sheet including just in time  cut to size products  for the c transport and the f a hornet programs 
the hornet program includes the new e f version which utilizes considerably more titanium than earlier c d models 
the agreement began in may and runs through april rmi is also the principal supplier of alloy sheet to bf goodrich aerospace aerostructures group  which designs and manufactures engine nacelle systems for large commercial and military aerospace applications 
rmi has contracts with construcciones aeronauticas sa casa of spain and daimler benz aerospace ag of germany for their alloy plate and sheet requirements in connection with the airbus and eurofighter programs 
all three contracts  with potential revenues totaling million  began in and extend for a minimum of three years 
as a result of softening aerospace demand  and the aerospace inventory adjustments referred to above  the company s total order backlog as of december  was approximately million  compared to million at december  the backlog includes amounts for the company s newly acquired subsidiaries  new century metals and weld tech engineering services lp on april   a strike by the united steelworkers of america that began on october  was settled by negotiation 
the niles plant is the company s largest production facility 
operations at the plant were conducted by nonstriking personnel at a rate of approximately of normal production levels while negotiations continued 
the cost of the strike  including lost shipments  was estimated to have been between to million per month 
fourth quarter and first quarter results were adversely impacted by the effects of the work stoppage 
second quarter results were also effected as the strike extended until april  and startup and retraining time delayed the resumption of full operations until july liquidity and capital resources net cash flows from operating activities totaled million in compared to million in the change in net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   compared to the comparable period was due primarily to reduced income partially offset by reduced spending on working capital compared to working capital amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in working capital results primarily from the repayment of the ncm note payable in january the company s working capital ratio was to at december  compared to to at december  during and  the company s cash flow requirements for capital expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations and borrowing under the company s million unsecured credit facility 
cash flow requirements for the acquisitions made in were provided through a combination of cash from operating activities and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
no acquisitions were made in the company anticipates that it will be able to fund its working capital requirements and its capital expenditures from funds generated primarily by operations 
on september   rti filed a universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission 
the registration would permit rti to issue up to million of debt and or equity securities at an unspecified future date 
the proceeds of any such issuance could be utilized to finance acquisitions  capital investments or other general purposes  however  rti has no immediate plans to do so 
capital expenditures gross capital expenditures for the years ended december  and amounted to and million  respectively 
included in spending was million on the galt alloys expansion  million related to a new  ton press at ncm  million for a new machine shop at the company s houston facility  approximately million for process improvements in niles  ohio and million on the company s enterprise resource planning erp software system 
rti anticipates that current capital spending plans can be funded using cash provided from internally generated sources 
capital spending for is budgeted at approximately million 
after completing an evaluation of future information technology needs and growth  together with expanding requirements for additional decision making tools  the company decided to install an erp software system 
in the erp system was installed at the company s largest domestic operations  and will eventually be installed at all domestic and foreign operations 
the company spent million in approximately million is budgeted for credit agreement rti entered into an unsecured credit agreement  dated september  the credit facility  to replace rmi s then existing credit facilities 
this agreement provides for million five year and million one year borrowings  on a revolving basis  of up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base equal to the sum of of qualifying accounts receivable and of qualifying inventory 
total borrowings are subject to a maximum leverage test in accordance with the agreement 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company  at its option  will be able to borrow at a a base rate which is the higher of pnc bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  or b libor plus a spread ranging from to determined by the ratio of the company s consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under this credit agreement and  under these covenants  had additional borrowing capacity of approximately million 
at december   million was outstanding under the facility 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations as well as various health and safety laws and regulations that are subject to frequent modifications and revisions 
while the costs of compliance for these matters have not had a material adverse impact on the company in the past  it is impossible to predict accurately the ultimate effect these changing laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
at december   the amount accrued for future environment related costs was million 
based on available information  the company believes its share of potential environmental related costs  before expected contributions from third parties  is in a range from million to million  in the aggregate 
the amount accrued is net of expected contributions from third parties which does not include any amounts from insurers of approximately million  which the company believes are probable 
the company has received contributions from such third parties for a number of years as partial reimbursement for costs incurred by the company 
as these proceedings continue toward final resolution  amounts in excess of those already provided may be necessary to discharge the company from its obligations for these projects 
the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters could individually  or in the aggregate  be material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  management believes that the company will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these matters could be resolved unfavorably 
new accounting standards the fasb issued sfas no

requires all derivatives to be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and be measured at fair value 
changes in such fair value will be recognized in income immediately if the derivatives are deemed not to be effective hedges 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently assessing the financial effect of the adoption of sfas no 
year compliance this is a year readiness disclosure as that term is defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act of beginning in january of  the company began to aggressively manage its computer software and hardware to insure that the year date change would not adversely impact its business 
the company made certain investments in its application software to ensure the company was year compliant 
in addition  the company monitored the compliance efforts of entities with which it interacts 
the company began modification of its internally developed proprietary software in noninformation technology systems such as process control devices and other automated equipment which may have contained imbedded chips that could have been affected by the year problem were identified and modified during the company contacted its key vendors  suppliers and service providers to monitor their compliance efforts 
a follow up was made with those third parties not responding to the company s original request 
to the extent necessary  the company identified alternative suppliers 
a survey of the company s customers to assess their year readiness was performed 
the company spent million to inventory  assess  modify and test both its information and noninformation technology requirements 
these costs do not include the enterprise resource planning software 
following a thorough evaluation and review of its existing and future information technology requirements  rti invested in a packaged enterprise resource planning erp software system which replaced much of the company s existing business systems 
initially  the erp system was installed at the company s largest domestic operations 
eventually  all domestic and foreign operations will be converted to the new system 
the erp system is certified year compliant 
the system replaced certain existing software which was not restructured to address the year end change at december  the company spent approximately million for consulting  software and hardware in conjunction with the enterprise resource planning software 
of that amount  million was spent in  and million was spent in the company expects to spend an additional million in the company believes that its year compliance efforts were successful  that its ability to manufacture and distribute its products was not impaired by year issues  and that it will not incur liability for breach of contract or other harm arising out of any failure of its erp system to be year compliant 
work stoppage rmi and the united steelworkers reached an agreement on a four and a half year agreement after a six month strike which ended april  the new agreement provided the union with increases in wages and pensions while in turn they agreed to significant changes in work rules 
operations during the strike were conducted by management and salaried personnel at a rate of approximately of normal production levels 
the cost of the strike including the effect of lost shipments was estimated at to million per month from january through june of startup and retraining costs were incurred from mid april through june 
the effect of the work stoppage for the entire fourth quarter was also estimated at to million per month

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk and price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies used in its manufacturing operations 
the company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available 
the majority of the company s raw material purchases for titanium sponge and titanium tetrachloride are made under long term contracts with negotiated prices 
the company s long term debt is based on rates that float with libor based rates or bank prime rates and the carrying value approximates fair value 
the company is also subject to foreign currency exchange exposure for operations whose assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company does not use forward exchange contracts to manage these risks  which are considered to be minimal 
the majority of the company s sales are made in us dollars  which minimizes exposure to foreign currency fluctuation
