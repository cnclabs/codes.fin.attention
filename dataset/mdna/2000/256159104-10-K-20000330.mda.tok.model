license revenues decreased by to million in  increased by to million in  and by to million in  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
in  license revenue was adversely impacted by a general industry slowdown in customer license sales for enterprise software applications 
in addition  the company experienced a weakness in customer demand and difficulty in closing large license contracts with customers in the first half of the growth in license revenues from to was due to an increase in the number of licenses sold  reflecting increased acceptance of the company s edms family of products  as well as an increase in the number of customers who purchased additional product licenses  and the expansion of the company s sales organization 
the decreases in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues in both and are due to increased service revenue  as discussed below 
for the years ended december    and license revenue from xerox and certain xerox affiliates  as systems integrators  accounted for   and of total license revenues  respectively 
the loss of a major customer or any reduction or delay in orders by such customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
also  the company s strategy to provide customers with whole solutions could result in software licenses being bundled with services 
therefore  with certain future transactions  the delivery of services may delay recognition of license revenue 
service revenues increased by to million in  by to million in  and by to million in  representing   and  of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in absolute dollars was attributable to a larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance  training and support services and increases in the company s professional services staff in conjunction with the company s focus to expand solution offerings to customers 
the increase in service revenue as a percent of total revenue was mainly due to a decrease in total license revenue 
the company markets its products through its direct sales force and its indirect channel partners

revenue from all indirect channel partners comprised   and  of license revenues in   and  respectively 
revenue from indirect partners for any period is subject to significant variations

international revenue represented   and  of license revenues in   and  respectively 
the increase in international revenue as a percent of license revenue in  was primarily due to an enterprise wide sale to a single global customer in the amount of million in europe  as well as a decrease in overall domestic license revenue 
in addition  sales in asia continue to grow as a result of growth in the sales force  resulting in increased revenue from asia as a percentage of total international revenue 
the company classifies license revenue as domestic or international based upon the billing location of the customer 
in many instances  especially with large purchases from multinational companies  the customer has the right to deploy the licenses anywhere in the world 
thus  the percentages discussed herein represent where licenses were sold  and may or may not represent where the products are used 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of international revenue are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance

the increase in cost of license revenue was related to a continued shift in the mix of products being sold 
the company currently carries more third party products and is selling a greater number of those products than it had in the same periods in the prior year
