factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business factors affecting the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
overview jd edwards develops  markets  and supports enterprise and supply chain computing solutions that enable customers to translate ideas into practical realities quickly and efficiently using idea to action tm software 
the company s integrated applications deliver e business solutions that give customers control over their front office  manufacturing  logistics distribution  human resources  finance  and customer service management processes for the consumer products  industrial  and services industries 
jd edwards enables idea to action with activera tm solutions  a collection of tools and technologies that extends jd edwards oneworld tm and worldsoftware tm enterprise business software and its supply chain planning solutions 
activera allows customers to change their software quickly and easily during and after implementation 
the company has developed and marketed enterprise software solutions for over years  principally for operation on as r and other ibm mid range systems and more recently for multiple computing environments  including windows nt r  unix r  and os r that are java tm and html enabled 
the company also provides implementation  training  and support services designed to enable customers to rapidly achieve the benefits of the company s solutions 
its operations are primarily in the united states  europe  africa  canada  asia  and latin america 
the company distributes its products and services through both direct and indirect sales channels 
currently  the company has direct sales and consulting offices located throughout the world 
the company also has more than business partners  including sales and consulting partners with offices throughout the world providing an indirect distribution channel to target certain markets or geographic areas 
generally  operating margins are higher on domestic revenue than on international revenue 
additionally  operating margins are generally higher in the geographic areas where the company s operations are more established than in the geographic areas where the company is investing new resources 
international revenue as a percentage of total revenue ranged between and for each of the past three fiscal years 
during the fiscal year ended october   the company s results of operations reflected an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million for fiscal the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for fiscal included in the net losses were expenses for in process research and development ipr d charges and amortization of acquired intangibles totaling million 
the losses in the fiscal period were primarily a result of a decline in license revenue for the fiscal year along with increased operating expenses compared to last year 
total costs and expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  or an increase of excluding charges related to the company s two acquisitions during fiscal during fiscal  external market  competitive  and internal factors significantly impacted the company s results 
specifically  a slowing of enterprise resource planning erp software purchases  resulting from companies focusing on their year preparations  affected the company s performance 
management also believes that many companies had purchased erp systems prior to in anticipation of the year to remain competitive  the company has increasingly focused on the rapid expansion of e business  supply chain  and front office solutions  other changes in the competitive environment  and continued advances in technology 
the company completed acquisitions of two privately held companies  numetrix  ltd 
numetrix  and the premisys corporation  in fiscal these investments further extended the company s supply chain and customer relationship management solutions as well as its ability to compete for business beyond the traditional erp market 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  and  accordingly  operating expenses were impacted in fiscal subsequent to the consummation dates of the acquisitions primarily as a result of ipr d charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets  as well as normal operating expenses 
recent agreements with third parties impacted the fiscal results and may impact future operating results 
in may  the company signed an agreement with siebel systems  inc siebel  which extends its customer relationship management offering to include the mobile sales professional 
the company expanded its procurement solutions by providing an intranet and internet based business to business electronic commerce solution for operating resources through an agreement with ariba  inc ariba  also signed in may in december  the company further invested in its future business to business solutions through agreements with tradex technologies tradex  specializing in digital marketplaces and trading communities 
also in december  the company signed reseller agreements with extensity  inc extensity to offer internet application solutions for e business employees 
furthermore  recent product alliances with companies such as iet intelligent electronics  xrt cerg finance  and armstrong laing group  together with a package supply chain solution with ibm global services and synquest  inc  extend the company s solutions in e business  customer relationship management  knowledge management  and supply chain management 
activera capabilities are expected to be enhanced through an agreement signed in november with proforma corporation proforma for business process modeling to improve customers ability to react to changing business needs 
in january  the company announced a new business initiative for application hosting  jde 
sourcing  that will work with third party hosting infrastructure providers for data center and network services 
these partnerships and investments enable the company to deliver a fully integrated end to end supply chain solution 
through the end of the fiscal year  license revenue from products of the premisys corporation  numetrix  siebel  and ariba was minimal and there can be no assurance that the company s investments in these partnerships will meet the expectations set by management 
fiscal results were also impacted by internal changes such as an investment at the beginning of the fiscal year in hiring and training sales account executives  marketing consultants  and vertical marketing support personnel 
the company also realigned its sales force along vertical industries effective in the first quarter of fiscal for the remainder of fiscal  the company focused on controlling expenses by closely reviewing headcount additions and added personnel only in critical positions 
in addition  controls over discretionary expenses were tightened throughout the company 
while operational changes affected the company s productivity and financial results  these were investments for the long term  from which management believes the company will benefit in the future 
due to the deterioration of economic conditions in the asian markets  particularly in japan  and in certain other geographic regions  the company continues to closely monitor its investments in international areas to ensure that such opportunities are deemed appropriate and are consistent with the company s overall future growth strategies 
the company made some personnel changes and reduced some layers of management through a voluntary reduction in force program in japan 
during the fiscal year ended october   a significant portion of the company s operating losses were a result of operations in asia 
consistent with its historical results  the company expects that during fiscal it will continue to recognize a relatively small percentage of its revenue from asia and other specific geographic areas that are currently being impacted by adverse economic conditions 
with the worldwide performance of the company continuing to be negatively impacted by certain economic conditions and the global market focus on year issues  risks associated with these international investments may not be mitigated by the broad geographic diversity of the company s operations 
as a result  the company s investments in certain international areas have had and may continue to have a material negative impact on its future financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that quarterly results in fiscal were not consistent with historical trends primarily due to the impact of the year on customers buying patterns 
however  the company has experienced and expects that it will continue to experience a high degree of seasonality in the future 
historically  a disproportionately greater amount of the company s revenue and an even greater proportion of net income for any fiscal year were recognized in its fourth fiscal quarter 
in the fourth quarter of and  the company recognized and of total revenue and and of license fee revenue  respectively 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  the company s operating margins historically have been significantly higher in its fourth fiscal quarter than in its other quarters 
the company believes that such seasonality is primarily the result of both the efforts of the company s direct sales force to meet or exceed fiscal year end sales quotas and the tendency of certain customers to finalize sales contracts at or near the end of the company s fiscal year 
because total revenue  operating margins  and net income historically were greater in the fourth quarter  any shortfall from anticipated revenue  particularly license fee revenue  in the fourth quarter would have a disproportionately large adverse effect on the company s operating results for the fiscal year 
the company s first quarter revenue historically has slowed during the holiday season in november and december  and its total revenue  license fee revenue  service revenue  and net income for its first fiscal quarter historically have been lower than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
for example  total revenue  license fee revenue  service revenue  and net income in the first quarter of fiscal decreased    and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to the seasonal factors described  the company s first quarter of fiscal may be impacted by continuing issues related to the year the company is actively addressing its future operating plans and  given the uncertainty and changes in the market  has taken the steps previously described to remain competitive in the future 
the continuing uncertainty in the traditional erp market that is attributed to a number of factors  including global economic conditions  issues surrounding the year  and strong competitive forces  could reduce the growth in the company s license fee revenue 
this uncertainty has made forward looking projections of future revenue and operating results even more challenging 
the first quarter of fiscal is particularly uncertain due to the changing millennium and the fact that it overlaps with the fourth quarters of several competitors 
there can be no assurance of the level of revenue growth  if any  that will be achieved or that the company s financial condition  results of operations  and market price of the company s common stock will not be adversely affected by unfavorable factors 
revenue recognition 
the company licenses software under non cancelable license agreements and provides related services  including consulting  training  and support 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which provides guidance on recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes sop further guidance was published during in sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
additionally  the aicpa issued technical questions and answers on financial accounting and reporting issues related to sop during and may issue additional interpretations related to sop in the future 
the company applied the provisions of sop on a prospective basis for new software transactions entered into from the beginning of fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations and did not have a significant impact on its licensing or revenue recognition practices 
however  there can be no assurance that additional guidance pertaining to the new standards will not result in unexpected modifications to the company s current revenue recognition practices that could materially adversely impact the company s future license fee revenue  results of operations  and financial condition 
consulting  implementation  and training services are not essential to the functionality of the company s software products  are separately priced  and are available from a number of suppliers 
revenue from these services is recorded separately from the license fee 
the company recognizes license fee revenue when a non cancelable  contingency free license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  fees from the arrangement are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
revenue on all software license transactions in which there are undelivered elements other than post contract customer support is deferred and recognized once such elements are delivered 
typically  the company s software licenses do not include significant post delivery obligations to be fulfilled by the company  and payments are due within a month period from the date of delivery 
where software license contracts call for payment terms in excess of months from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
revenue from consulting  implementation  and training services is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from agreements for supporting and providing periodic upgrades to the licensed software is recorded as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably over the support service period 
such unearned revenue includes a portion of the related arrangement fee equal to the fair value of any bundled support services 
the company does not require collateral for its receivables  and reserves are maintained for potential losses 
sop provides additional guidance regarding software revenue recognition and is required to be adopted as of the beginning of the company s first quarter of fiscal the company has determined that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue except for gross margin data year ended october  revenue license fees services total revenue costs and expenses cost of license fees cost of services sales and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of acquired software and other intangibles acquired in process research and development total costs and expenses operating income loss other income expense  net 
income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes 
net income loss gross margin on license fee revenue gross margin on service revenue fiscal years ended october  and total revenue 
total revenue increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the revenue mix between license fees and services was and  respectively  for fiscal compared to and  respectively  for fiscal the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was from growth in services revenue while license fee revenue declined  resulting in a significant change in revenue mix 
management believes the slowed growth was primarily due to companies purchasing erp systems prior to in anticipation of potential systems issues associated with the year during fiscal  the company experienced sequential declines in quarterly license fee revenue in the first and second quarters 
however  sequential quarterly growth in license fees again was realized in the third and fourth quarters 
the growth in services revenue  which typically trails license fee revenue  also was impacted  slowing from growth in fiscal to in fiscal there can be no assurance that the company s revenue will not continue to be adversely affected by increased market focus on year compliance  economic conditions  or other factors 
geographically  the revenue mix shifted moderately toward international for fiscal compared to last year 
the geographic areas defined as the united states  europe  the middle east  and africa emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively  for fiscal comparatively  for fiscal  the united states  emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively 
management believes this geographic shift in revenue may have been caused by companies in the united states preparing earlier and more aggressively for the year as compared with companies in other parts of the world 
license fees 
license fee revenue decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to fewer transactions and a decline in the average transaction size as compared to last year 
the decrease in the average transaction size was experienced with both new and existing customers and due to a number of factors  including a larger portion of licenses for the windows nt platform  which typically include fewer users than licenses for the unix or as platforms 
the percentage of license activity from new customers declined to in fiscal compared to last fiscal year 
however  the company expanded the number of its customers by compared to the end of fiscal to over  at october  customers have increasingly accepted the oneworld applications available for windows nt and unix platforms in addition to the as platform 
as an indication of oneworld s growing acceptance on non as platforms  of license activity was from customers using the windows nt or unix platforms in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the remaining portion of license activity was generated by customers using either worldsoftware or oneworld for the as the company expects that an increasing portion of the company s total future license fee revenue will be generated from customers using windows nt  unix platforms  or other web enabled computing environments 
as previously discussed in the overview of the company s results of operations  the company has experienced increased uncertainty in its business due to external market and competitive factors  as well as a slower than anticipated realization of benefits from internal operational changes 
management invested in its capacity to achieve future license revenue growth by substantially expanding its direct sales force during the fourth quarter of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company realigned the sales force along vertical industries and increased resources in vertical marketing support 
while these additions to the sales force and the change to a vertical market focus contributed to sequential growth in license fees in the last two quarters of fiscal  there can be no assurance that the company s license fee revenue  results of operations  and financial condition will not continue to be adversely affected in future periods as a result of a continued focus in the market on year readiness  global economic conditions  and intensified competitive pressures  or that the company s operational investments for the long term will be successful 
services 
services revenue grew to million for fiscal from million for the year ended october  this increase was due to higher revenue from consulting  the largest component of services  and higher maintenance revenue 
the increase in consulting revenue was primarily due to prior period license fee revenue  which resulted in demand for implementation services 
maintenance revenue increased during the current year compared to last year  primarily as a result of the company s growing installed base of customers and consistent maintenance renewal rates for existing customers 
training revenue  which typically trails the fluctuations in license fee revenue  decreased during fiscal compared to last year  primarily due to the decrease in license fee revenue 
as a percentage of total revenue  services revenue increased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
this was primarily due to the timing of services revenue in relation to license fee growth in prior periods 
given the decline in license fee activity in fiscal in relation to a year ago  demand for services may decline in future periods 
the continued focus by companies on year readiness may severely impact consulting and training services in the first quarter of fiscal  and maintenance renewal rates also may be adversely affected 
in any fiscal year  total services revenue is dependent upon license transactions closed during the current and preceding periods  the growth in the company s installed base of customers  the amount and size of consulting engagements  the number of company and business partner consultants available to staff engagements  the number of customers referred to alliance partners for consulting and training services  the number of customers who have contracted for support and the amount of the related fees  billing rates for consulting services and training courses  and the number of customers attending training courses 
there can be no assurance that the company s services revenue will continue to grow or that the results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected in future periods 
historically  the company has been the primary service provider for its customers  either directly or through subcontracted services from its business partners 
the subcontracted consulting and training services revenue from business partners increased for fiscal over the prior year  while direct services increased in the current fiscal year over fiscal the services revenue generated through subcontracted work accounted for for fiscal of the company s consulting and training services revenue compared to for fiscal in addition to subcontracting a substantial portion of its services work to business partners  the company is continuing to pursue a strategy of relying on third party alliance partners to contract directly with the company s customers under a referral arrangement for oneworld implementations and related services 
the company established additional alliances during fiscal to achieve this objective  and several existing alliance partners began providing significantly more resources to implement oneworld compared to last fiscal year 
however  migration to this services model has been slower than originally anticipated 
while the number of transactions involving the alliance partners who contracted directly with the company s customers increased during fiscal compared to last year  the number of implementations referred to alliance partners to date under this arrangement remains relatively limited 
to the extent the company is successful in establishing this strategy and in generating license fee revenue  consulting revenue as a percentage of total revenue is likely to gradually decrease as compared to the previous fiscal year 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its strategy 
cost of license fees 
cost of license fees includes business partner commissions  royalties  amortization of internally developed capitalized software  documentation  and software delivery expenses 
the total dollar amount for the cost of license fees decreased to million for the year ended october   from million last year primarily due to lower license revenue and resulting decreases in royalty expenses and business partner commissions 
however  royalties are expected to increase in future quarters as a result of royalties associated with revenue resulting from the agreements with siebel  ariba  proforma  tradex  and extensity 
amortization of internally developed capitalized software costs decreased in fiscal compared to the last year as certain software development costs were fully amortized during fiscal the capitalized oneworld costs will be fully amortized after the first quarter of fiscal business partner costs may represent a larger percentage of revenue compared to the previous year if the company is successful with certain expanded sales channel initiatives and business alliances that would increase expenses and could reduce gross margins 
software delivery expenses also may increase in future periods primarily due to the opening of a software reproduction and distribution facility located in dublin  ireland  in the second quarter of fiscal accordingly  the total cost of license fees is likely to increase in future periods 
gross margin on license fee revenue varies from quarter to quarter depending upon the revenue volume in relation to certain fixed costs  such as the amortization of internally developed capitalized software development costs  and the portion of the company s software products that are subject to royalty payments and the amounts negotiated for such royalties 
the gross margin on license fee revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal year primarily due to lower royalty expense and business partner commissions 
due to the expected increase in royalties and software delivery expenses  as well as possible increases in other costs  it is likely that the gross margin on license fee revenue will decline in future periods 
cost of services 
cost of services includes the personnel and related overhead costs for services  including consulting  training  and support  as well as fees paid to third parties for subcontracted services 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to subcontracted business partner service costs and increased personnel expenses to support the implementation and consulting services demand  as well as an increase in the number of customer support staff 
during fiscal  a larger percentage of consulting and training services revenue was generated through subcontracted work  which increased the related costs compared to last year 
the gross margin on services revenue dropped to for fiscal compared to for fiscal due to the slowing in license fee growth  the utilization rates for the company s consulting organization declined in fiscal compared to fiscal generally  the gross margin on maintenance revenue is higher than on consulting and training revenue  and any change in the mix in types of services will affect the gross margin on total services revenue 
in particular  the extent to which the company is successful in establishing its strategy of relying on alliance partners to contract directly with the company s customers for oneworld implementations and related services will affect gross margin on services revenue 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its strategy 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists of personnel  commissions  and related overhead costs for the sales and marketing activities of the company  together with advertising and promotion costs 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in expense in fiscal was primarily the result of additional personnel and increased advertising and promotion costs for the company s expanded marketing activities 
the total number of sales and marketing personnel increased as of october   compared to a year ago  primarily as the result of the company adding personnel in direct sales and support positions through the first quarter of fiscal to meet the company s future sales goals  to support the new vertical industry sales force alignment  and to address the windows nt and unix market growth opportunities from the oneworld version of its application suites 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for the support and administrative functions of the company 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended october   from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the total dollar amount of expense increased primarily due to an increase in general and administrative personnel to support the larger number of total company employees in fiscal year compared to last year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased primarily due to the lower than expected license fee revenue in fiscal research and development 
research and development expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for product development  enhancements  upgrades  documentation and translations  quality assurance  and testing 
research and development expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to a increase in the number of personnel compared to the end of the last year 
this increase in personnel includes approximately employees from the company s acquisitions of the premisys corporation and numetrix 
development resources primarily were devoted to enhancements of both the company s worldsoftware and oneworld application suites during both fiscal and the company ceased capitalizing oneworld development costs during fiscal  and there were no software development costs capitalized during fiscal or the company anticipates that future research and development expenses will increase in subsequent periods due to a number of development projects 
the company is continuing its ongoing internal product enhancements in e business and other areas and its integration of modules such as sales force automation and advanced planning and scheduling  utilizing third party development alliances  such as siebel and ariba  for certain development projects 
amortization of acquired software and other intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles was related to the acquisitions of numetrix in june and the premisys corporation in february acquired intangible assets consist of core software  in place workforce  customer base  and goodwill 
amortization expense for the fiscal year ended october   related to the software  in place workforce  customer base  and goodwill was million  million  million  and million  respectively 
in process research and development 
ipr d expenses were in connection with the acquisitions of numetrix in june and the premisys corporation in february ipr d consists of those products that are not yet proven to be technically feasible but have been developed to a point where there is value associated with them in relation to potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses are believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned values were expensed immediately upon the closing dates of the acquisitions 
aggregate ipr d expenses were million for fiscal no such charges were incurred in fiscal numetrix is a provider of internet enabled supply chain planning software  including demand planning  production scheduling  and distribution applications  for medium and large manufacturing companies 
the numetrix product suite is being integrated with the company s existing enterprise application solutions to link customers  suppliers  and trading partners in collaborative enterprise networks 
numetrix software modules will also continue to be sold separately 
the numetrix acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the company retained an independent appraiser to assist with assigning fair values to the intangible assets 
specifically identified intangible assets include developed technology  in process technology  in place workforce  and the existing customer base 
the valuations relied on methodologies that most closely related the fair market value assignment with the economic benefits provided by each asset and the risks associated with the assets 
in valuing both the developed and in process technology  an income based approach was determined to best quantify the economic benefits and risks 
the economic benefits were quantified using projections of net cash flows and the risks by applying an appropriate discount rate 
as of the acquisition date  numetrix had completed a substantial amount of research and development on a new discrete scheduling product that represents a strategic product designed to address the market for discrete factory planning for middle market companies 
also underway was the development of a new demand planning module and a new collaborative enabler 
numetrix also was developing major revisions and enhancements of almost all of the modules of its product suite as of the date of acquisition 
following is a description of the specific nature of each of the new in process development projects acquired the most significant in process technology is being designed to offer an operational level  discrete planning and scheduling solution targeted at the middle market 
numetrix s current solution in the market relies on process scheduling rather than discrete scheduling  and a large technical difference exists between the two types of scheduling 
process scheduling is used by manufacturers in industries  such as paper products and processed foods  with significant capital investment in the machinery compared to the investment in raw material products 
these types of industries require production and scheduling systems to coordinate with the interruptible nature of the manufacturing process 
in comparison  discrete scheduling is utilized in industries with non interruptible processes with emphasis on the product materials rather than the machinery  such as computer component manufacturing 
the two types of scheduling employ different data models  and users in each case require different operating parameters from production scheduling solutions 
as of the valuation date  the beta release was scheduled for september  and the development was estimated to be nearly complete 
this project continues to progress  however  the beta release was postponed until fiscal a new demand planning module was being designed to enhance enterprise wide collaborative forecasting and to address forecast reconciliation 
this application is intended to be marketed as a component of both the numetrix product suite and the new discrete product 
new features of this product include a full forecasting graphical interface that allows for manipulation of variables and inputs to optimize demand planning 
as of the valuation date  numetrix was analyzing requirements for the product and had not begun to write code 
the first scheduled release was planned for the middle of calendar as of the acquisition  date  this module was less than complete 
the project is postponed pending further evaluation by management 
another in process technology  a collaborative enabler  is designed to efficiently interface the messaging architecture among applications to allow real time  alert driven collaboration 
the product automatically detects changes to data in other applications and instantaneously processes the impact of the changes among applications 
it is designed to integrate into the numetrix product suite solution and offers a more cost effective solution for messaging optimization as compared to the current technology 
the initial product release was scheduled for the middle of calendar  and as of the acquisition date the technology was estimated to be complete 
the company has not changed the product schedule since the acquisition date 
both the developed technology and in process development valuations were based primarily on an income approach that examined all projected revenue and expenses attributable to the assets over the economic life of each 
a variation of the income approach that applies a percentage of completion calculation was also used to value in process technology  and this method was used for recording the fair value of in process development 
in this approach  the research and development costs to complete the in process technology are not deducted as an expense 
however  the net cash flows are multiplied by the percentage of completion of the technology 
the percentage of completion was based on the development expense spent as of the valuation date as a percentage of the total required development expense for each new product and each new release of the existing products 
the basis of the financial projections used in the valuation analysis were management projections of the revenue and expenses likely to be realized by numetrix 
projected revenue was split between developed  in process  and future technology to be developed subsequent to the valuation date 
the classification of each research and development project as complete or under development was made in accordance with the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 sfas no 
and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
all expenses associated with those revenues were deducted  including cost of goods sold  sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
allocations of revenue and expenses between developed  in process  and future technology were based on the development schedule of new products and new versions of existing products and the estimated lines of code needed to complete each in process product phase as provided by numetrix 
unless otherwise appropriate  these expenses were allocated to developed  in process  and future technology in the same ratio as the revenue 
an economic rent for use of other assets was deducted  including the in place workforce  working capital  fixed assets  trademarks  and customer base 
a royalty rate for the proprietary distributed object messaging architecture doma was deducted where appropriate for applications relying on this existing technology 
income taxes were deducted at the estimated effective tax rate for the company 
an appropriate discount rate was applied to the projects to calculate the net present value of the developed and in process technology over their economic lives 
the valuations used a discounted cash flow analysis of financial projections over the estimated useful lives of the existing technology 
after the end of the projection period  no further revenue was assumed  and no residual value of the technologies was used 
the projected revenue stream by product developed  in process  and future was determined by the existing lines of software code and incremental lines of code for future releases of each product 
the discount rate was based on the weighted average cost of capital method and was determined to be for numetrix 
this same rate was used for valuing the ipr d due to the level of risk  which was considered the same as that for the company as a whole 
a discount rate of was used for developed technology due to the lower level of risk 
financial projections used to value the intangibles included breakdowns of revenue from license fees  implementation and consulting services  and maintenance  along with costs of the revenue components  major operating expense categories  and income taxes for the current fiscal year through numetrix s fiscal year ending february  based on historical data provided by management of numetrix regarding the rate at which the code base for developed technology would become obsolete  the expected replacement and augmentation of existing software code for each product  as well as the rate at which replacement technology would be developed  the projection period was deemed appropriate 
significant changes were not anticipated from historical pricing or gross margins 
management anticipates solid revenue growth consistent with historical and projected results of competitors as well as general market expectations for the supply chain management space and especially web enabled applications  such as those currently and expected to be offered by numetrix 
also  the discrete scheduling product currently under development targets the much larger market of mid sized manufacturing companies in addition to the company s traditional market of fortune customers 
operating expenses are also expected to increase significantly but  as a percentage of revenue  are projected to fall closer in line with industry averages consistent with the major erp providers  including jd edwards  oracle  and sap 
accordingly  the operating margin is expected to be at a break even point in the current fiscal year and gradually increase through numetrix s fiscal year ending february  the appraisal resulted in a value of million for ipr d and million for developed technology 
the premisys corporation provides visual configuration software and consulting services 
at the date of acquisition  the premisys corporation was developing major enhancements to its customworks product  such as functionality to address setup complexities and quoting 
additionally  the premisys corporation and jd edwards began developing an interface between customworks and oneworld under a product alliances partner agreement entered into by the two companies in august technology acquired in the company s purchase of the premisys corporation is currently being fully integrated with oneworld  furthering enhancements to the jd edwards supply chain solution 
the percentage completion variation of the income approach also was used to value the ipr d from the premisys corporation acquisition based on projected revenue and expenses likely to be realized 
however  both a replacement cost approach and market approach also were considered and provided further support for the valuation 
the percentage of completion for the in process technology was based on the development expense spent as of the valuation date as a percentage of the total required development expense 
the financial projections include revenue from license fees  implementation and consulting services  and maintenance  along with costs of the revenue components  major operating expense categories  and income taxes for the current fiscal year through fiscal year charges for other assets also were deducted  including a royalty for the core technology  fixed assets  working capital  and other intangibles 
income taxes were deducted at the estimated effective tax rate for the company 
a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for the level of risk associated with the development projects 
this rate was used over the economic life to calculate the net present value of million for the developed and million for the in process technology 
the assumptions in the valuation reflect management s anticipation of solid revenue growth consistent with the historical and projected results of competitors  as well as general market expectations for the supply chain management space and front office applications such as customworks 
operating expenses also are expected to increase significantly but are projected to gradually fall in line with industry averages consistent with the major erp providers  including jd edwards  oracle  and sap 
accordingly  the operating margin in the financial model is expected to grow over the next two years  but then gradually decline as the developed and in process products mature 
if the company is unable to complete the in process development projects within the expected schedule  future revenue and earnings could be materially impacted as management believes supply chain solutions such as those offered by numetrix and the premisys corporation are integral to its ability to remain competitive in the extended erp market 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments  interest expense  foreign currency gains and losses  and other non operating income and expenses 
interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher yields on invested funds 
interest income is expected to decline in future periods as a result of lower cash and investment balances due primarily to the cash outlay for the numetrix acquisition 
other income also increased due to proceeds from a legal judgement received during the second quarter of fiscal net of hedging activities during the current year  foreign currency losses decreased to  for fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an improved hedging program 
during late fiscal  the company broadened its foreign exchange hedging activities to help offset the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
such hedging activities cannot completely protect the company from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which the company conducts business  the volatility of currency rates  and the constantly changing currency exposures 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
the company uses hedging instruments to mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
the hedging instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of generally three months or less in term 
all contracts are entered into with major financial institutions 
gains and losses on these contracts are recognized as non operating income or expense in the period in which the gain or loss is recognized from the settlement or translation of the underlying assets and liabilities 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
provision for benefit from income taxes

the total revenue increase in fiscal was due to growth in both software license transactions and services  with higher growth in license fees than services 
the revenue mix between license fees and services was and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for fiscal the company increased the number of large license transactions and the number of new customers as compared to fiscal  expanding its installed base of customers by compared to the end of fiscal to approximately  at october  geographically  the overall growth was led by strong performance in emea  with a increase in total revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal the geographic areas defined as united states  emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively  for fiscal comparatively  during fiscal  the united states  emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively 
license fees 
license fee revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing an increase of 
the growth was primarily due to increases in the volume of license transactions  the number of new customers added during the year  and the number of large license transactions 
the oneworld version of application suites expanded the company s target market to include customers using windows nt and unix platforms in addition to those using the as platform 
the portion of license fee revenue generated from customers using either windows nt or unix platforms increased to in fiscal from in fiscal services 
service revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing an increase of 
the company continued to experience increased demand for services in fiscal compared to the previous year 
the increase in total service revenue was led by higher revenue from consulting  the largest component of services  although training and support revenue also increased 
consulting revenue increased primarily due to the increase in license transactions and the demand for implementations  as well as the expanded capacity from both internal personnel and business partner resources 
support revenue increased primarily as a result of the company s growing installed base of customers 
training revenue increased primarily due to the increase in license transactions  expanded capacity  additional personnel resources  and an increase in prices for certain courses 
as a percentage of total revenue  services revenue remained higher than license fee revenue due to the continued increases in demand and the company s ongoing commitment to provide consulting and training services that complement its software products 
the company subcontracted a portion of its consulting and training services to third parties 
the portion of such service revenue generated through subcontracted work accounted for in fiscal compared to in fiscal in addition to subcontracting out some of its service work to business partners  the company put a strategy in place during the previous fiscal year to utilize third parties to contract directly with its customers to implement the oneworld version of its applications suites 
during fiscal  new business alliances were established to achieve this objective  and several existing alliance partners provided significantly more resources to implement oneworld  however  through the end of fiscal the company had referred only a limited number of its implementations to such third parties 
the transition to this referral strategy had a limited impact on the fiscal results due to direct service contracts currently in place and established relationships with existing customers 
cost of license fees 
cost of license fees increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of costs in fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the volume of license transactions closed through business partners  resulting in higher commissions to the business partners 
the overall increase in costs compared to fiscal was partially offset by the company s renegotiation of certain royalty agreements effective in fiscal  which lowered royalty expense compared to fiscal amortization of capitalized software development costs was relatively consistent at million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal capitalized software costs primarily relate to the oneworld applications and will continue to be amortized through the first quarter of fiscal the gross margin on license fee revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margin on license fee revenue varies depending upon the revenue volume in relation to certain fixed costs such as the amortization of software development costs  the volume of license transactions closed through business partners  internal terms  and the proportion of the company s software products that are subject to royalty payments 
the fiscal results were positively impacted by the overall increase in license fee revenue volume and lower royalty expense on complementary third party software products licensed through the company in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the dollar amount increase was primarily due to additional personnel and subcontracted service costs to support the growth in demand for implementation and consulting services  as well as an increase in customer support staff 
during fiscal  the company invested additional resources for training its personnel and business partners on the oneworld applications and related computer platforms 
as a result  the gross margin on service revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
increased license fee revenue impacted sales and marketing expenses during fiscal by driving higher sales commission expense as compared to fiscal the increase in the total dollar amount of expense was also the result of additional personnel and increased advertising and promotion costs for the company s expanded publicity activities 
the total number of sales and marketing personnel increased as of october   compared to a year ago 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased primarily as a result of outside costs associated with the company s marketing  promotion  and advertising placement activity in fiscal as compared to the previous year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the total dollar amount of expense was higher in fiscal primarily due to an increase in personnel and subcontracted services to facilitate the growth in the company s operations 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined primarily as a result of the growth in revenue volume and increased efficiencies within support functions to effectively manage the overall growth in the company s operations 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal in addition  no software development costs were capitalized in fiscal  while million was capitalized in fiscal total research and development expenditures were higher in fiscal primarily due to a increase in personnel  together with increases in related facilities and equipment costs 
development resources were primarily devoted to enhancements of both the company s worldsoftware and oneworld application suites during both fiscal and capitalized software development costs in fiscal primarily consisted of oneworld development costs  which the company ceased capitalizing during the first half of fiscal following the release of the version in late calendar as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenditures  including capitalized software development costs in fiscal  were relatively consistent at in fiscal and in fiscal other income expense 
interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to interest earned on the investment of proceeds from the company s ipo completed in september foreign currency losses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies

expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased in the fourth quarter due to seasonally higher license fee revenue 
gross margin on license fee revenue has varied quarterly from to within the last eight quarters due to fluctuations in license volume and the mix of fixed and variable costs of licenses 
gross margin on service revenue has moderately declined primarily due to lower utilization and investments in resources for training personnel and business partners 
the company s service revenue may be severely impacted in its first fiscal quarter of fiscal by a lack of demand resulting from year preparations by customers as well as lower maintenance renewal rates once the year activities have subsided 
additionally  service revenue is usually lower in the first quarter due to the holiday season in november and december 
based on all of the foregoing  the company believes that future revenue  expenses  and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result  quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
furthermore  the company believes that in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to the company s business or generally  the market price of the company s common stock likely would be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term and long term investments  and a million unsecured  revolving line of credit that can be utilized for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of october   the company had working capital of million  and no amounts were outstanding under the company s bank line of credit 
short term deferred revenue and customer deposits totaling million are included in determining this amount 
the short term deferred revenue primarily represents annual maintenance payments billed to customers that is recognized ratably as revenue over the support service period 
without the short term deferred revenue and customer deposits  working capital would have been million  and including long term investments working capital would have been million 
the company calculates accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso on a gross basis by dividing its accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by revenue for the quarter multiplied by days 
calculated as such  dso was days as of october   compared to days as of the previous fiscal year end 
the company s dso can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors  including the concentration of transactions that occur toward the end of each quarter and the variability of quarterly operating results 
see factors affecting the company s business  operating results and financial condition quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
the company generated operating cash flow of million for fiscal and million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in operating cash flow was due primarily to the fiscal net loss before acquired ipr d and cash payments for accrued liabilities  somewhat offset by collections of accounts receivable 
the company utilized cash for investing activities of million in fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
net cash payments totaled million for the numetrix acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal the company purchased the premisys corporation for a net cash payment of million and shares of jd edwards common stock valued at million during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal and  the primary investing activity was the purchase of short and long term debt and equity securities with cash from the ipo 
during each of these fiscal years  the company purchased furniture  fixtures  and equipment that were necessary to support its expanding operations 
in fiscal and  the company s cash utilized for investing activities was offset in part by million and million  respectively  of proceeds from the sale of assets 
financing activities provided million in cash from exercised common stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity  and the company issued a total of million shares of common stock during fiscal in september  the company completed its ipo of million shares of common stock  of which million were issued by the company  generating net proceeds of million 
the company did not have other significant net financing activities for the past three fiscal years 
the company utilized its bank line of credit for working capital and other general corporate purposes during fiscal but repaid all amounts borrowed within that fiscal year 
in august  the company authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock under a share repurchase plan 
the plan is designed to partially offset the effects of share issuances under the stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on several factors  including the level of stock issuances under the stock plans  the price of jd edwards stock  general market conditions  and other factors 
stock repurchases may be effected from time to time at management s discretion through forward  put and call transactions  or open market purchases 
the company leases its corporate headquarters office buildings constructed on land owned by the company 
the lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of a bank  and a syndication of banks have collectively financed up to million in purchase and construction costs through a combination of equity and debt 
the company guarantees the residual value of each building up to approximately of its original cost 
the company s lease obligations are based on a return on the lessor s costs 
management has elected to reduce the interest rate used to calculate lease expense by collateralizing up to of the financing arrangements with investments consistent with the company s investment policy 
the company may withdraw the funds used as collateral at its sole discretion  provided it is not in default under the lease agreement 
at october   investments totaling million were designated as collateral for these leases 
in december  the company committed to cash outlays totaling approximately million to be paid during the first or second quarter of fiscal for certain strategic investments and other agreements 
additional cash outlays related to these arrangements totaling approximately million may be made either at the company s option or are contingent upon certain future events 
management believes its cash and cash equivalents balance  short term and long term investments  amounts available under existing credit facilities  and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next months 
additionally  the company also may continue to use a portion of its short and long term investments to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to those of the company or to acquire treasury stock 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes  in which case the company may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to the company and would not result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
impact of the year issue the year issue is a result of computer systems and other electronic equipment using software processors or embedded chips that use only two digit entries in the date code field and may not be able to distinguish whether means or the potential for system errors and failures involves substantially all aspects of the company s internal operations  including computer systems  voice and data networks  and the infrastructure of its facilities 
to address the company wide internal year readiness activities  the company established a corporate readiness program during fiscal to coordinate efforts already then underway in the information technology it and software development departments and to expand the program to include all business functions and geographic areas 
the program addressed internal operational and financial risks as well as those associated with business partners and other third parties 
status reports on this program have been periodically presented to the company s senior management and to the audit committee of the board of directors 
state of readiness 
the company completed a readiness program to assess the company s internal state of readiness and to direct preparations for the year issues related to the current versions of its proprietary software products had been addressed prior to inception of the corporate readiness program  and management believes the product to be generally year compliant 
the company encouraged its customers to migrate to current product versions that are year ready and provided regular correspondence regarding year preparations to its customers in the last several months leading up to the new year 
the company s internal business operations are significantly dependent upon the proprietary software products it licenses to customers 
to date  no business interruptions associated with these applications have been experienced and none are currently anticipated 
following is the six step process followed in the readiness program awareness make all levels of the organization aware of year issues 
inventory obtain detailed lists of specific issues from representatives in every area of the company s operations 
assessment complete a detailed inventory review to determine and prioritize areas of exposure  identify mission critical processes and systems  initiate certification of year compliance for vendors suppliers landlords  and establish contingency plans 
resolution decide which systems to replace  retrofit  or retire  initiate conversion to systems that are year ready 
testing obtain assurance that conversions were completed properly and that the systems and processes will function correctly  finalize contingency plans 
deployment implement new or modified systems and processes back into normal production  implement contingency plans where appropriate 
costs 
the company estimates that when calculations are final  the direct costs to remediate year issues will total approximately million and does not anticipate such costs will have a material impact on its results of operations 
as the company has now completed its readiness program  future costs to monitor any additional potential problems are expected to be minimal 
the estimated costs include the budget for the company s corporate readiness programs  it and non it costs  including legal expenses  expenses associated with a field readiness task force  equipment purchases  and maintenance provided over the weekend of the actual date change to the year such costs do not include an estimate for labor  overhead  or other resources that are associated with the impact of year compliance but are not directly involved in the project and also not expected to have a material impact 
management believes that customers and potential customers purchasing patterns have been affected in a number of ways  and the current slowing in license fee growth may be primarily due to such changes 
many companies already have expended significant resources to upgrade their systems 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those the company offers 
additionally  it is possible that certain of the company s customers purchased support contracts only to ensure that they are year ready and then will cancel such contracts 
many customers may have deferred purchasing year ready products as long as possible  accelerated purchasing such products  switched to other systems or suppliers  or purchased the company s products only as an interim solution 
although the company currently offers software products that are designed and have been tested to be ready for the year  there can be no assurance that the company s software products contain all necessary date code changes 
furthermore  it has been widely reported that a significant amount of litigation surrounding business interruptions will arise out of year issues 
it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the company may be affected by such litigation 
the company mailed information regarding the year issue along with a questionnaire to its customers in march to assist them in preparations for the century change as well as to help the company assess its customer service demands 
based upon the number of responses received and the number of customers that originally licensed recent product versions  the company estimated that a significant majority of its customer base is currently operating with a version of its software applications that is year ready 
however  the company could be faced with an inability to meet the demand for services to upgrade its existing installed base of customers or to meet increased demand from potential customers who still need to address their year issues 
factors outside the company s control could cause significant disruptions to business activities and affect the company s operations in the year  such as the failure of its third party business partners  suppliers  government entities  customers  and others to adequately prepare 
additionally  third party software and computer technology used internally may materially impact the company if not year compliant 
the company s operations may be at risk and a material adverse impact to the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition could result if any third parties failed to adequately address the problem or if software conversions result in system incompatibilities with these third parties 
contingency plans 
as part of the six step process previously outlined  specific contingency plans were developed in connection with the assessment and resolution to the mission critical risks identified 
such planning was complicated by the risk of multiple year problems and the fact that many of the company s risks reside with third parties who may not have successfully addressed their own risks 
however  the company established certain contingency plans for both it and non it systems for identified mission critical functions 
such plans included backup power for the company s facilities  explicit manual workaround procedures  additional staffing at critical times  and the identification of key contacts worldwide who are responsible for addressing specific issues and implementing such plans 
euro in january  a new currency called the ecu or the euro was introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all participating emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
during the next two years  business in participating emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in these emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
although the company currently offers software products that are designed to be euro currency enabled  and management believes it will be able to accommodate any required euro currency changes  there can be no assurance that the software will contain all the necessary changes or meet all of the euro currency requirements 
if the company s software does not meet all the euro currency requirements  its business  operating results  and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the company has not had and does not expect a material impact on its results of operations from foreign currency gains or losses as a result of its transition to the euro as the functional currency for its subsidiaries based in emu countries

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of its operations  the company is exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory  or credit risks  are not included in the following assessment of the company s market risks 
foreign currency exchange rates 
operations outside of the us expose the company to foreign currency exchange rate changes and could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
during fiscal  of the company s total revenue was generated from its international operations  and the net assets of the company s foreign operations totaled of consolidated net assets as of october  the company s exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which it conducts business 
the company operates outside the us primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  africa  asia  canada  and latin america 
these foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or  more recently  the euro as their functional currency as revenue is generated and expenses are incurred in such currencies 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
such hedging activities cannot completely protect the company from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which the company conducts business  the volatility of currency rates  and the constantly changing currency exposures 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its exposures from foreign net asset and forward foreign exchange contracts as of october   and its exposure from anticipated foreign revenue in fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in foreign currency rates from the fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition for the next fiscal year 
interest rates 
investments  including cash equivalents  consist of us  state  and municipal bonds  as well as domestic corporate bonds  with maturities of up to months 
all investments are classified as held to maturity as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and accordingly are carried at amortized cost 
additionally  the company has lease obligations calculated as a return on the lessor s costs of funding based on libor and adjusted from time to time to reflect any changes in the company s leverage ratio 
changes in interest rates could impact the company s anticipated interest income and lease obligations or could impact the fair market value of its investments 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its interest rate exposures and its exposure from anticipated investment and borrowing levels for fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in interest rates from the fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of investments and would not materially impact the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition for the next fiscal year
