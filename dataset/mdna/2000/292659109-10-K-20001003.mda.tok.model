item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company has continued to invest to further advance its technologies 
these investments in its technologies have led to historic new strategic alliances over the past nine months with texaco inc  nv bekaert nv and its us based subsidiary bekaert  intel corporation  general electric company  lockheed martin space electronics and communications and china s rare earth high tech co 
ltd 
of baotou steel company rare earth high tech 
according to generally accepted accounting principles as practiced in the united states gaap  the company was required to report these investments as a loss 
the company had a net loss in the year ended june   of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended june  the change resulted primarily from a reduction in revenues to  in from  in and a  increase in operating expenses 
the change in revenues primarily resulted from lower revenues from license and other agreements  and revenues from product development agreements  partially offset by higher product sales  and royalties 
revenues from license agreements include  from a license agreement with toshiba battery company ltd   from sanyo electric co  ltd 
and  from japan storage battery co  ltd  compared to a  license fee in from sanyo 
other revenues increased from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june   principally due to revenues of  from ovonyx  ecd s joint venture with tyler lowrey and intel 
the ecd ovonic battery programs in the ovonic nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology have led to a new family of batteries not only for hybrid electric vehicles hevs  electric vehicles evs and fuel cell electric vehicles fcevs  but also for a new universal battery platform that has included a much needed addition to the starter lighter ignition battery field where especially high voltages are required 
ecd s continued investments in its battery  solid hydride  and fuel cell development programs  as well as its activities at united solar and bekaert ecd solar systems are all reported as losses 
losses related to electrode production and the ongoing protection of the company s intellectual property also contributed to the losses 
in addition to the loss from operations  the company incurred other expense net of  in the year ended june   compared to other expense net of  in the same period in the prior year 
product sales  consisting of positive and negative battery electrodes  battery packs  machine building and photovoltaic products for united solar since april   increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  battery pack sales increased to  in from  in and machine building revenues increased to  in from  in the machine building revenues in both years were applicable to contracts to build large area microwave deposition equipment 
sales of negative and positive electrodes decreased  primarily due to one of the company s principal negative electrode licensees currently manufacturing its own electrode products as allowed under its license from the company 
photovoltaic sales for the period from april  the date united solar was consolidated through june  were  royalties increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  while the volume of nimh batteries currently being sold has increased substantially  the royalties the company receives continue to reflect increased production efficiencies of its licensees which have resulted in lower prices as licensees move aggressively to increase market share

these expenses were reduced to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  operating  general and administrative expenses increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  primarily due to reduced allocations in to cost of revenues from product development agreements  costs associated with a restricted stock grant to one of the company s executives  increased costs associated with stockholder relations and other increased costs in other income net of  in the year ended june  compared to other expense net of  in the year ended june  the  reduction was due to a  expense versus  in representing the company s equity in the net loss in its investment in united solar represented as a net loss on the company s financial statements and higher interest expense  partially offset by a  gain on the sale of ovonic battery stock in and higher interest income 
this  expense is related to ecd s cash investments in united solar s future growth 
the company does business in many different parts of the world and its royalty revenues are affected by changes in foreign currencies and their exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
however  the vast majority of the company s business agreements are denominated in us dollars and  as such  the company has minimized its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had unrestricted consolidated cash  cash equivalents  investments and accounts receivable of  an increase of  from june  as of june   the company had consolidated working capital of  compared with a consolidated working capital of  as of june  the company s strategy is to finance its operations and growth through strategic alliances joint ventures and license agreements with third parties who can provide financial resources and marketing expertise for the company s technologies and products 
over the past several months  the company has entered into a number of historic business agreements bringing the company s short term cash reserves to approximately million and having a significant positive impact on future cash flows 
as part of its long standing strategy  the company has made investments in its technologies which have resulted in enabling intellectual property and products 
it has entered into strategic alliances and joint ventures with some of the world s leading corporations listed below  which form the basis of a fundamental restructuring of the company 
highlights are o on may   ecd and texaco announced that texaco purchased a percent equity position in the company for million and texaco and ecd intend  as soon as practicable  to enter into joint ventures to promote the development and commercialization of ovonic solid hydrogen storage systems tm and ovonic regenerative fuel cells tm technology 
ecd will provide each venture with a license of ecd s intellectual property relating to the respective field and texaco will provide funding to some agreed level 
o on september   ecd and texaco energy systems  inc tesi  a wholly owned subsidiary of texaco  formed texaco ovonic fuel cell company llc 
tesi will fund initial product and market development estimated to exceed million 
the primary use of this funding is to fund a multimillion dollar contract from texaco ovonic fuel cell to ecd to further develop ovonic regenerative fuel cells tm technology  validate manufacturing methodologies and produce production ready prototypes 
o in april  ecd and bekaert entered into a strategic alliance whereby bekaert will invest million in united solar  which will result in a fivefold capacity expansion and a sales and marketing expansion program 
the capacity expansion resulted in an order from bekaert ecd solar systems to ecd for production equipment valued at approximately million with an annual capacity of megawatts 
o a strategic alliance was formed with general electric  the first activity of which resulted in the creation of a joint venture  ovonic media  llc  in march ecd received a multimillion dollar contract from ovonic media to design  develop  demonstrate and commercialize ecd s proprietary continuous web roll to roll technology for the ultra high speed manufacture of optical media products  primarily rewritable dvds 
o ovonyx formed a strategic alliance with intel in february  which entails an investment by intel in ovonyx  to commercialize ecd s proprietary nonvolatile semiconductor memory technology  oum 
oum memory technology promises to enable significantly faster write and erase speeds and higher cycling endurance than conventional memory types 
it has been used in rewritable cd and dvd disks and may have potential as a replacement for such memory types as flash  sram and dram 
the alliance with intel also includes the granting of a nonexclusive royalty bearing license agreement and a joint development program utilizing intel s wafer fabrication facilities 
o on april   ovonic battery  after having received all necessary government approvals  officially started the first total contract value is million in a series of nimh projects in china 
on june   the second and third projects total contract value is million were started 
these projects  first announced in august  with rare earth ovonic create joint ventures  of which ovonic battery has a interest  which provide an important entry for the company into the vast chinese market and have potential revenue to ovonic battery in excess of million 
these new business agreements have both near term and long term impact on the company s capital resources 
the texaco  bekaert  ovonyx and general electric agreements will all result in reduced cash expenditures as the company s business partners assume the responsibility for funding operations 
in the year ended june   the company entered into a new license agreement  in license fees plus future royalties with toshiba battery for its hev technology 
in addition  japan storage  a licensee  notified the company that it had reached a certain level of sales of its products and that the company had earned an additional license fee of  pursuant to certain terms contained in the previous license agreement with japan storage 
during the year ended june    of cash was used in operations 
the difference between the net loss of  and the net cash used in operations was principally due to ecd s  share of the losses in united solar relating to ecd s investment of cash in united solar s future growth and the company s depreciation expense 
as a result of bekaert s investment in united solar  ecd is no longer funding united solar s operations 
in addition   of machinery and equipment was purchased or constructed  principally for the company s battery operations  during this period 
the company expects significant revenues and cash flows related to product development agreements  many of which already exist  that are entered into by the company with industry partners and us government agencies to develop the company s products and production technology 
ecd has been awarded government contracts with various governmental agencies doe  nrel  nist  etc 
and with various industry partners 
during the next months  the company expects to purchase up to  of machinery and equipment 
the company has a financing arrangement with standard federal bank  a member of the abn amro group  for a  line of credit bearing an interest rate at prime rate  which expires on june  the company does not expect to use any of this available financing during the next months 
as previously noted  the company s strategy is to finance its operations and growth through the formation of strategic alliances to further commercialize its products 
the agreements discussed above will provide significant cash flows in the future 
while the company is in negotiations with a number of companies related to its technologies  which will accelerate the commercialization of its products worldwide and which could provide it with additional revenue under license and other agreements in the coming year  it is unable to predict the amount  if any  of such revenue 
the company is not aware of events or circumstances that would significantly alter royalty revenues for the next months 
based upon the above information  the amount of cash to be received under existing product development agreements in the year ending june  is anticipated to be approximately  compared to  received from product development agreements in the year ended june  based on historical trends  the amount of cash from royalties to be received in the year ending june  is expected to be approximately  compared to  received in the year ended june  since license agreements are continuously being negotiated  fees from such agreements are difficult to predict 
the company is unable to forecast the amount of cash to be received from license fees in the year ending june  due to the recent increase in its stock price  the company has received  since august   approximately million million of which occurred after june  in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the exercise of warrants 
while there are additional employee stock options and warrants  which may be exercised  the company is unable to predict the amount or the timing of such exercises 
management believes that funds generated from operations  new business agreements and existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to support and finance planned growth  capital expenditures and company sponsored product development programs over the coming year
