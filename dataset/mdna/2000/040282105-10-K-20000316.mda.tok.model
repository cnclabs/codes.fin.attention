half of that amount  or  will be paid in cash and half will be satisfied by issuance of the company s common stock 
the company will finance the cash portion of the purchase price utilizing the existing lines of credit

for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value  but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would decrease the fair value of interest rate swaps by approximately  the earnings and cash flow impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase interest in rates would be neutral because of the cash flow received from the swaps

seasonality the company s telecom services operations are expected to have seasonally weaker results in the first and fourth quarters of the year  and may produce stronger results in the second and third quarters 
this seasonality is primarily due to the effect of winter weather on outside plant activities in the northern areas served by acg  as well as reduced daylight hours and customer budgetary constraints 
certain customers tend to complete budgeted capital expenditures before the end of the year  and postpone additional expenditures until the subsequent fiscal period 
year date conversion the year issue relates to the inability of certain computer software programs to properly recognize and process date sensitive information relative to the year and beyond 
without corrective measures  this issue could cause computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results 
incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue by the company or by its key vendors  customers suppliers or by other third parties could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  operations or financial condition in the future

the company has not spent a material amount on year compliance issues 
most expenses have related to the operating costs associated with time spent by employees and consultants in the evaluation and implementation process and year compliance matters generally
