item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results and market price of stock and elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended june  all yearly references are to our fiscal years ended june    and  unless otherwise indicated 
all tabular amounts are in thousands  except percentages 
results of operations we classify our product offerings into three segments mobile information management  printing solutions  and other products 
our mobile information management segment includes both mobile data management and universal mobile connectivity products that enable users to access  collect  synchronize and print information on demand 
the products in our mobile information management segment include data synchronization and management software  wireless connectivity products  enterprise internet appliances and client server database management systems with remote access capabilities 
we sell our mobile information management products primarily to original equipment manufacturers  enterprises  application developers and computer resellers both directly and through our e commerce storefronts on the internet 
we derive revenue from sales of hardware products  software license fees  non recurring development fees that are generated when we adapt our products to a customer s specifications  support and maintenance fees  and royalties 
we believe that net revenue from mobile information management products will generate a larger percentage of net revenue as we continue to focus our research and development and our marketing and sales efforts on our mobile information management products and as our mobile information management products continue to achieve increased market acceptance 
our future results of operations will be highly dependent upon the success of recently introduced products and the success of our recent acquisitions 
our printing solutions segment includes our maturing network print server and non network printer sharing products sold primarily through our worldwide distribution channel to computer resellers and fortune companies 
we also sell printing solutions products to a number of original equipment manufacturers 
our net revenue and income from operations from the printing solutions segment decreased from last year  partially due to decreased unit sales of both network print server and non network printer sharing products as we shifted resources to support our mobile information management products 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of hardware products and  to a lesser extent  from non recurring development fees and royalties 
we expect net revenue and income from operations from our printing solutions products will continue to decline over the next several quarters and will continue to become a smaller percentage of our net revenue 
although our printing solutions segment is not our primary focus for the future  we will continue to update these products  adding emerging technologies such as fiber and mobile connectivity options 
our other products segment has primarily consisted of our mechanical port replicator products 
we derived revenue from sales of hardware products 
in december  we exited the mechanical port replicator business 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales  principally from our international sales subsidiaries  original equipment manufacturers and from a limited number of distributors 
in fiscal  and  sales outside of north america represented  and of our net revenue  respectively 
we experienced a slow down in sales in europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to a slow down in technology purchases by customers and we may face a further decrease in sales in europe in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of typical seasonality in europe and certain other regions in the summer months when business activities decrease 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of net revenue in the foreseeable future 
in fiscal  and  sales to customers in asia represented  and of net revenue  respectively 
increasing revenue from asian customers was primarily related to sales to large multi national original equipment manufacturers that incorporate or bundle our products with their products and sell their products worldwide 
several of our products  in particular our extendnet print servers  xtndaccess wireless connectivity products  and xtndconnect data synchronization and management software  are sold to original equipment manufacturers 
we intend to continue to increase sales to original equipment manufacturers in the future  particularly with our mobile information management products 
in fiscal and  sales of mobile information management products and services to hewlett packard accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
substantially all of our net revenue derived from hewlett packard is generated by sales of our xtndaccess irda printer adapter for bundling with one of its mid range printers 
hewlett packard also licenses and purchases other mobile information management products 
in april  hewlett packard notified us that it is no longer bundling our xtndaccess irda printer adapter with hewlett packard printers sold in north america  but is offering our product as a free accessory to their customers with the purchase of the hewlett packard printer 
unit sales and net revenue from hewlett packard in the fourth quarter of fiscal declined from the previous quarter and we expect our revenue from hewlett packard  primarily in asia  to continue to decline in future quarters 
revenue from original equipment manufacturer sales has in the past and is expected in the future to fluctuate on a quarterly basis  as demand in the original equipment manufacturer market is difficult to predict and dependent on the timing of original equipment manufacturer projects and the effectiveness of their marketing efforts 
we market and sell some of our products  primarily our printing solution products  through multiple indirect channels  primarily distributors and resellers 
we support our indirect channels with our own marketing and sales organization 
in fiscal  sales to ingram micro accounted for of our net revenue  primarily from printing solutions products 
we provide most of our distributors and resellers with price protection rights and limited product return rights for stock rotation 
stock rotation rights permit distributors to return products to us for credit against an offsetting purchase order  but are limited based upon amounts purchased by a given distributor during the preceding quarter 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for those products 
we expanded our product offerings in our mobile information management segment with our august acquisition of oval limited 
oval  based in bristol  england  was the parent company of advance systems limited  a developer of server based synchronization and data management software for portable computing devices and high end mobile phones  and zebedee software limited  a software consulting company 
fiscal year ended june  change change net revenue    the increase in net revenue in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to a increase in net revenue from our mobile information management products 
the increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in net revenue from our printing solutions products 
net revenue was relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal the slight increase in net revenue was primarily the result of our mobile information management products  which grew from fiscal the increase in revenue from mobile information management products was offset by an decline in revenue from our other products segment  primarily our mechanical port replicator products  which declined from fiscal  and a decline in revenue from our printing solutions segment 
as a result of our discontinuance of the mechanical port replicator products  we recorded product returns and a provision for product returns totaling million in fiscal fiscal year ended june  change change gross profit    gross margin our cost of net revenue consists primarily of costs associated with components  out sourced manufacturing of particular subassemblies  in house labor associated with assembly  testing  shipping and quality assurance  amortization of purchased technology and royalties for the use of third party software 
the slight decrease in gross margin for fiscal from fiscal was the result of increased shipments of lower margin mobile information management hardware products to original equipment manufacturers  partially offset by an increase in sales of mobile information management software products 
the decrease in our gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in unit sales of lower margin mobile information management hardware products and a shift in product mix in the printing solutions segment to lower priced and lower margin products 
the decrease in gross margin was also the result of an increase in the allowance for port replicator returns of million and an increase in the inventory valuation allowance for port replicators of million 
the decrease was partially offset by increased royalty  license and non recurring development fee revenue in our mobile information management segment and increased sales of mobile information management software products 
we expect that gross margin in our printing solutions segment may continue to decline as a result of a continued shift in product mix toward lower margin products 
we also expect that increased sales of our mobile information management software products will continue to have a positive impact on our gross margin 
fiscal year ended june  change change research and development    as a of net revenue research and development expenses generally consist of salaries and other personnel costs of our research and development teams  facilities costs and travel expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of additional personnel costs in our mobile information management segment as a result of our acquisitions of advance systems in august  rand software in october and parallax research in november at june   we had full time equivalent engineers  a increase from the full time equivalent engineers on staff at june  the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal was principally due to increased personnel costs in our mobile information management segment primarily as a result of our acquisitions of rand software and parallax research 
the increase was partially offset by reduced personnel costs in our printing solutions and other products segments 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in the future  primarily as a result of increased staffing in our mobile information management segment  although these expenses may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
fiscal year ended june  change change marketing and sales    as a of net revenue marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other personnel costs of our marketing  sales and support personnel and promotional expenses 
the increases in marketing and sales expenses for fiscal from fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to increased personnel costs and promotional activities for the mobile information management segment both domestically and at our european subsidiaries 
these increases were partially offset by decreased promotional activities within our printing solutions segment and our other products segment 
we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to increase in the future  primarily in our mobile information management segment  although these expenses may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
fiscal year ended june  change change general and administrative    as a of net revenue general and administrative expenses generally consist of salaries and other personnel costs of our finance  management information systems  human resources and other administrative employees and professional services expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to increased costs subsequent to our acquisition of advance systems and an increase in professional services expenses 
the increase was also attributable to an in increase in our premiums for directors and officers insurance as a result of an increase in our coverage limit resulting from a significant increase in our market capitalization and the current market environment for directors and officers insurance 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal from fiscal was principally attributable to increased fees for professional services as a result of operating as a publicly traded company and increased administrative expenses subsequent to our acquisition of parallax 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as our operations continue to expand  although these expenses may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
fiscal year ended june  change change amortization of intangibles  as a of net revenue amortization of intangibles in fiscal and is the result of goodwill and other intangibles  which arose from our acquisitions of advance systems  rand software and parallax research 
fiscal year ended june  change change income tax provision benefit   as a of income loss before taxes 
the change in the income tax benefit for fiscal from fiscal was attributable to an increase in the loss before income taxes 
the change in the effective tax rate for fiscal from the prior year was primarily the result of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets arising from our acquisition of advance systems and on foreign tax credit carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the change in the income tax provision or benefit for fiscal from the prior year was primarily due to a loss before income taxes in fiscal the change in our effective tax rate from fiscal from fiscal is primarily the result of non deductible expenses associated with our rand software and parallax research acquisitions  acquired in process research and development expenses and amortization of intangibles 
results of operations by segment the discussion below addresses the operating results attributable to each of our three product segments 
mobile information management segment our mobile information management segment includes both mobile data management and universal mobile connectivity products that enable users to access  collect  synchronize and print information on demand 
our products in our mobile information management segment include data synchronization and management software  wireless connectivity products  enterprise internet solutions and client server database management systems with remote access capabilities 
fiscal year ended june  change change net revenue    loss from operations   net revenue from mobile information management products grew to of our net revenue for fiscal  up from in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in net revenue for fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to increased unit sales of xtndaccess hardware products to original equipment manufacturers  increased license fees from our xtndconnect data synchronization and management products  increased unit sales of internet appliance products  increased license fees from xtndaccess wireless connectivity products and increased license revenue from advantage database server products 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of hardware products sold to original equipment manufacturers 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal from fiscal was the result of increased unit sales of hardware products to original equipment manufacturers and internet access products  and increased license revenue for advantage database server products 
the increased loss from operations for our mobile information management segment in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of an acquired in process research and development charge of million from our august acquisition of advance systems and increased amortization associated with this acquisition 
the loss was also attributed to increases in spending for research and development projects for both mobile data management and universal mobile connectivity products and increased spending in marketing and sales for all mobile information management products worldwide 
our mobile information management segment recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of  in fiscal related to the acquisitions of rand software and parallax research 
the loss from operations for our mobile information management segment decreased in fiscal as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased gross profit from mobile information management products 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by a significant increase in our spending for mobile information management research and development projects for both our wireless connectivity hardware and software products and the acquired in process research and development charges of  from our fiscal acquisitions 
we also increased our spending in marketing and sales for all mobile information management products worldwide 
printing solutions segment the printing solutions segment includes our maturing network print server and non network printer sharing products  sold primarily through our worldwide distribution channel to computer resellers and fortune companies 
fiscal year ended june  change change net revenue    income loss from operations   in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our printing solutions products 
the decrease in net revenue for fiscal from fiscal was principally due to decreased unit sales of both network print server products and non network printer sharing products worldwide 
the decrease in net revenue for fiscal from the prior year was principally due to decreased unit sales of both non networked printer sharing and network print server products coupled with a decrease in the average selling prices caused by a shift in product mix to lower priced products 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in unit sales of print servers to original equipment manufacturers at a slightly lower average selling price than in the prior year 
income loss from operations from our printing solutions segment decreased in fiscal from fiscal and fiscal primarily due to decreased gross profit from both network print server and non network printer sharing products partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as we shifted resources to support our mobile information management products 
other products segment the primary component of our other products segment is our mechanical port replicator products  which we discontinued in december fiscal year ended june  change change net revenue  loss from operations   business combination oval in august  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of oval limited for million in cash  including acquisition expenses  and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
we accounted for this transaction by the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations  and  accordingly  oval s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date 
oval  based in bristol  england  was the parent company of advance systems limited and zebedee software limited 
advance systems was the developer of xtndconnect server  formerly asl connect  a server based data synchronization and management software for portable computing devices and high end mobile phones that allows the update and exchange of data with enterprise applications such as microsoft exchange  lotus notes and corporate databases 
zebedee software was a software consulting company 
substantially all of the net assets owned by  and operations of  the oval consolidated group were attributable to advance systems  therefore  we will refer to advance systems herein when referring to the acquisition 
a summary of the net assets acquired at the date of the acquisition is as follows net working capital property and equipment developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles  acquired in process research and development  valuation of the intangible assets acquired from advance systems  including acquired in process research and development  developed technology and goodwill was determined by independent appraisers 
based upon such independent appraisals  we estimated that  in aggregate  the fair value of acquired in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was million 
we expensed the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development as a charge to operations in the first quarter of fiscal the appraisers determined the value assigned to acquired in process research and development by projecting net cash flows related to future products expected to result from commercialization of the acquired in process research and development 
the net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates and excluded amounts expected to result from existing products and technologies 
projected net revenue included the expected evolution of the technology and the reliance of future technologies on the in process technologies over time  but excluded amounts expected to result from existing products and technologies 
we based the estimated cost of net revenue and estimated operating expenses on our cost structure and that of comparable companies 
the net cash flows were adjusted for the stage of completion of the projects and discounted to their present values based on risk adjusted discount rates of to 
the discount rates were based on various factors such as the stage of completion at the acquisition date  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  costs incurred as of the valuation date  difficulties of completing the remaining development in a reasonable time  technical uncertainties of the remaining tasks  and the costs remaining to complete the projects 
we used a portion of the acquired in process research and development to further enhance advance systems existing server based synchronization technology by implementing a plug in architecture 
this type of design allows users and third party software providers to develop small software components that plug into our xtndconnect server product and extend the range of applications supported by xtndconnect server 
in september  we implemented the first phase of this architecture with the release of xtndconnect server version  which supports ibm s db everywhere dbe handheld relational database and microsoft s activex data object ado interface and provides other enhanced management tools 
the acquired in process research and development assigned to this project was valued at  as of the date of the acquisition 
we incurred an estimated  to complete version in november and december  we released versions of xtndconnect server that support encryption  lotus notes domino r and symbian s epoc operating system 
the acquired in process research and development assigned to this project was valued at million at the date of the acquisition 
this project was approximately complete at the time of the acquisition and required an estimated  to complete 
we will use the remaining acquired in process research and development to provide further enhancements to the architecture of our xtndconnect server product line  which at the time of the acquisition were only approximately complete 
the acquired in process research and development assigned to this project was valued at  as of the date of the acquisition 
we expect to incur an additional  from the date of the acquisition  to develop the in process technology into a commercially viable product with the nature of the efforts principally relating to development and testing that is required to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the primary risk with the completion of this project is the overall scope and complexity 
we expect to complete this project by december rand software and parallax research in october  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of rand software for  in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at  in november  we acquired a controlling interest in parallax research for  in cash and by assuming  in debt 
in may  we acquired the remaining outstanding stock of parallax research for  in cash 
these transactions were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations  and  accordingly  the results of operations of both companies have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition dates 
rand software was the developer of xtndconnect pc  formerly harmony  a data synchronization and management software providing support for mobile devices such as windows ce handheld personal computers 
this synchronization technology allows mobile devices to update and exchange data with enterprise applications such as microsoft exchange  microsoft outlook  lotus notes and symantec act 
parallax research develops infrared connectivity products primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers and manages our relationships with our manufacturers in asia 
a summary of the total net assets acquired at the date of the acquisitions is as follows net working capital property and equipment developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles  acquired in process research and development the valuation of the intangible assets acquired from rand software and parallax research  including the acquired in process research and development  developed technology and goodwill  was determined by independent appraisers 
based upon these independent appraisals  we estimated that  in aggregate  the fair value of acquired in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was  the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development was expensed as a charge to operations in the second quarter of fiscal the appraisers determined the value assigned to acquired in process research and development by projecting net cash flows related to future products expected to result from commercialization of the acquired in process research and development 
the net cash flows from these projects were based on estimates we made 
projected net revenue included the expected evolution of the technology and the reliance of future technologies on the in process technologies over time  but excluded amounts expected to result from existing products and technologies 
we based the estimated cost of sales and estimated operating expenses on our cost structure and that of comparable companies 
the net cash flows were adjusted for the stage of completion of the projects and discounted to their present values based on risk adjusted discount rates of to 
the discount rates were based on various factors such as lack of operating history  aggressive projections for some products  reliance on original equipment manufacturers  management depth  and product diversification 
rand software s research and development in process on the date of the acquisition related to a server based data synchronization software product that was estimated to be approximately complete and would require an estimated  and man months of time to complete 
development in process at the time of the acquisition of rand software was subsequently utilized to develop a web based synchronization product and will continue to be incorporated into additional mobile information management products  including products complementary to the server based product acquired with advance systems in august we used acquired in process research and development from parallax research to develop new products using the developing fast infrared technology standard 
a product being developed for an original equipment manufacturer  to be used in a printer based product  accounted for a substantial majority of the acquired in process research and development from parallax research 
all projects in process at the time of the acquisition were completed in fiscal at an estimated cost of  liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was million and was primarily a result of the payment of the discount upon maturity of our long term debt and an increase in receivables  principally income taxes receivable 
these cash uses were partially offset by our net loss  adjusted for such items as depreciation and amortization and acquired in process research and development  and a decrease in inventory 
the net cash used by operating activities in fiscal of  was primarily a result of an increase in receivables  inventories and prepaids and other assets and a decrease in payables 
these cash uses were partially offset by our net loss  adjusted for such items as the provision for write down of inventory  depreciation and amortization and acquired in process research and development 
accounts receivable was million at june  and we expect that accounts receivable may increase in the event that net revenue increases and as net revenue from original equipment manufacturers and international customers represents a higher percentage of our net revenue 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million  which consisted primarily of cash payments for the acquisition of oval  the parent company of advance systems 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million  which reflected the net purchases of available for sale securities  the purchase of property and equipment and the net cash paid in our acquisitions of rand software and parallax research 
we currently plan to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  primarily for software  system improvements and personal computers 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  which consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans  partially offset by payments on our long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  which resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
we have an uncollateralized bank revolving line of credit of million that expires on october  interest on borrowings is at the lender s prime rate minus 
there were no borrowings under this line at june  or the line of credit agreement have restrictive covenants that require us to maintain particular financial ratios 
we believe that our existing working capital and borrowing capacity  coupled with the funds generated from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt payment requirements through fiscal in the longer term  we may require additional sources of liquidity to fund future growth 
these sources of liquidity may include additional equity offerings  which could result in dilution to our stockholders  or additional debt financing 
in addition to our acquisitions of rand software and parallax research in fiscal and our acquisition of advance systems in fiscal  we intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  companies with complementary products  technologies or distribution networks in order to broaden our product offerings and to provide a more complete mobile information management product offering 
we have no additional commitments or agreements regarding any transaction of this kind  however  we may acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
we may require additional financing in the future and  if we were required to obtain additional financing in the future  sources of capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales  principally through our international subsidiaries and through a limited number of original equipment manufacturers and independent distributors 
sales made by our international subsidiaries  excluding our singapore subsidiary  are generally denominated in foreign currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies could harm our business 
we have not experienced significant costs as a result of the introduction of a european single currency  known as the euro  introduced on january  at an appropriate point before the end of the transition period  december   product prices in participating countries will be denominated in the euro and converted to local denominations 
during the transition period  our financial systems located in the participating countries will be converted from local denominations to the euro 
we do not presently expect that the transition to the euro will significantly affect our foreign currency exchange and hedging activities 
further  we do not expect that the transition to the euro will result in any significant increase in costs to us and all costs associated with the transition to the euro will be expensed to operations as incurred 
while we will continue to evaluate the impact of the transition of the euro  based on currently available information  we do not believe that the introduction of the euro will harm our business 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the euro and british pound  to hedge payments and receipts of foreign currencies related to transactions with international subsidiaries 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  these fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on these foreign currency receivables would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in minimal net exposure for us 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
if we implement hedging activities in the future for foreign currency transactions  we may not be successful in these hedging activities 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
the statement requires entities to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this standard may have on our operations 
this statement is effective for our first quarter of fiscal the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  in december this bulletin summarizes the securities and exchange commission s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this bulletin may have on our operations 
we are required to adopt this bulletin by our fourth quarter of fiscal in march the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
clarifies the application of accounting principles board opinion no 
and was effective as of july  this interpretation is not expected to impact our results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock our quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of our stock may fall 
some of the factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include  but are not limited to changes in the buying patterns of our original equipment manufacturer customers  changes in customer demand for our products  announcements or introductions of new products or services by our competitors  delays in developing and introducing new products and services  changes in our pricing policies as a result of increased competition  the mix of distribution channels through which we sell our products  the market acceptance of our new and enhanced products and the products of our original equipment manufacturers  the emergence of new technologies or industry standards  the timing of customer orders  which can be influenced by fiscal year end buying pressure and seasonal trends  a shift in the mix of products sold  resulting in increased sales of lower margin products  the discontinuation of any of our product offerings  which could result in product returns and inventory writeoffs  and changes in accounting standards  including standards relating to revenue recognition  business combinations and stock based compensation 
our stock price may be volatile and could drop significantly  resulting in the partial or total loss of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock may significantly fluctuate  which may cause your investment to decrease in value 
for example  during the year ended june   the price of our common stock ranged from to per share 
the following factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the computer and mobile device industry  price and trading volume volatility in the public stock markets generally  and changes in security analysts earnings estimates or recommendations regarding us  our competitors or our customers 
for additional information regarding the historical trading prices of our common stock  see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
we depend on a number of key business relationships and  if we fail to maintain these relationships or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
an important element of our strategy involves entering into key business relationships with other companies that relate to product development  joint marketing and the development of protocols for mobile communications 
if we fail to maintain our current relationships or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
some of these relationships impose substantial product support obligations on us  which may not be offset by significant revenue 
the benefits to us may not outweigh or justify our obligations in these relationships 
also  in order to meet our current or future obligations to original equipment manufacturers  we may be required to allocate additional internal resources to original equipment manufacturers product development projects which may delay the completion dates of our other current product development projects 
our existing key business relationships do not  and any future key business relationships may not  provide us any exclusive rights 
many of the companies with which we have established and intend to establish key business relationships have multiple strategic relationships  and these companies may not regard their relationships with us as significant 
most of these relationships may be terminated by either party with little notice 
in addition  these companies may attempt to develop or acquire products that compete with our products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
further  our existing business relationships may interfere with our ability to enter into other relationships 
if specific industry wide standards and protocols  such as bluetooth  wap and irda  upon which our products are or will be based  do not achieve widespread acceptance  our business would be harmed 
we have designed a number of our current and upcoming products to conform to industry standard infrared  short range radio and networking standards and protocols  such as the short range radio communication protocol known as bluetooth  the wireless application protocol wap  and the communication protocol created by the infrared data association  known as irda 
if these standards and protocols do not achieve acceptance  our business would be harmed 
even if accepted  these industry wide specifications may not be widely adopted  or competing specifications may emerge 
in addition  technologies based on these standards and specifications may not be adopted as the standard or preferred technologies for wireless connectivity  thereby discouraging manufacturers of personal computers and mobile devices from bundling or integrating these technologies in their products 
the mobile data management and universal mobile connectivity markets are new and evolving and may not continue to grow  which would reduce demand for our products and harm our business 
the mobile data management and universal mobile connectivity markets are still emerging and may not continue to grow 
even if the markets grow  our products that address these markets may not be successful 
the success of these products will rely to a large degree on the increased use of mobile devices  including personal digital assistants  cell phones  pagers  laptop and handheld computers and digital cameras 
enterprises and original equipment manufacturers may not develop sufficient confidence in mobile devices to deploy our products to a significant degree 
any inability to continue to penetrate the existing markets for mobile data management and universal mobile connectivity products  the failure of current markets to grow  new markets to develop or these markets to be receptive to our products  could harm our business 
the emergence of these markets will be affected by a number of factors beyond our control 
if original equipment manufacturers reduce their purchases of our products  our operating results and future growth could be harmed 
a significant portion of our net revenue in any quarter is typically derived from sales to a limited number of original equipment manufacturers 
for example  in fiscal and  sales of mobile information management products and services to hewlett packard accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
in april  hewlett packard notified us that it is no longer bundling our xtndaccess irda printer adapter with hewlett packard printers sold in north america  but is offering our product as a free accessory to their customers with the purchase of the hewlett packard printer 
as a result  unit sales and net revenue from hewlett packard declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the previous quarter 
in the event that these or other original equipment manufacturers reduce their purchases of our products  our operating results and future growth could be harmed 
in addition  any significant deferral of purchases of our products by original equipment manufacturers could harm our quarterly operating results 
sales to original equipment manufacturers frequently involve lengthy sales cycles  typically six to months  and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including competing products or technology that original equipment manufacturers may incorporate into their systems or internally develop  original equipment manufacturers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures  the timing of original equipment manufacturers budget cycles  the timing of original equipment manufacturers competitive product evaluation processes  and the effectiveness of original equipment manufacturers marketing efforts of for their own products 
we intend to pursue additional acquisitions  and any acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or adversely affect our operating results 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand our existing business 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions  our business would be harmed 
we may not be able to properly evaluate the technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including accounting charges and transaction expenses 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and difficulties  including expansion into new markets and business areas  the integration of acquired technologies with our existing products and technologies  diversion of management s attention and other resources to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  availability of equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders  integration of management information systems  personnel  research and development and marketing  sales and support operations  and potential adverse short term effects on our operating results 
in addition  if we conduct acquisitions using debt or equity securities  existing stockholders may be diluted  which could affect the market price of our stock 
we forecast certain component inventory purchases and many of our expenses based on expected net revenue  which is difficult to predict 
if we fail to accurately predict net revenue in a particular period  we may be unable to adjust our component inventory purchasing and expenses in that period  and our operating results would be harmed 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results depend in large part on the volume and timing of orders received within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
we typically operate with a relatively small order backlog and significant component inventory purchases and portions of our expenses are fixed in advance  based in large part on our forecast of future net revenue 
in addition  a majority of our net revenue results from the sale of products to a limited number of original equipment manufacturers and distributors  which are difficult to predict 
none of our distributors or original equipment manufacturers are obligated to purchase our products or certain component inventory that is used in the manufacturer of our products except pursuant to current purchase orders or purchase agreements 
if net revenue is below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust component inventory purchasing and spending to compensate for the shortfall 
also  we may be required to record an increase in our provision for obsolete inventory if certain component inventory that we purchase anticipating a higher level of product sales cannot be returned to vendors and the inventory cannot be used in the manufacturer of our other products 
therefore  a shortfall in actual net revenue as compared to estimated net revenue could harm our operating results 
we have experienced seasonality in our net revenue  which may cause our operating results to fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced some seasonality in our net revenue and we expect to continue to experience seasonality in the future 
net revenue in our first fiscal quarter is typically lower than net revenue in the prior fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting lower sales in europe and other regions in the summer months when business activities are reduced 
our market is becoming increasingly competitive  which could result in lower prices for our products or a loss of market share 
we may not compete successfully against current or future competitors  some of whom have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins  loss of market share and a change in our business and marketing strategies  any of which could harm our business 
the competitive environment may require us to make changes in our products  pricing  licensing  services or marketing to maintain and extend the market acceptance of our products 
price concessions or the emergence of other pricing or distribution strategies by our competitors or us may diminish our revenue 
we compete with mobile data management companies  including puma technology  fusionone  aether software and starfish software  a subsidiary of motorola  client server database providers  including microsoft  interbase  pervasive software and oracle  mobile connectivity companies  including widcomm  digianswer a subsidiary of motorola and actisys  internet solutions providers  including ibm  cobalt networks  esoft and ramp networks  print server manufacturers  including hewlett packard  intel and lexmark  and internal research and development departments of original equipment manufacturers  many of whom are our current customers 
as the markets for mobile data management and universal mobile connectivity products grow  we expect competition from existing competitors to intensify and new competitors  including original equipment manufacturers to whom we sell our products  to introduce products that compete with ours 
if our third party manufacturers fail to provide us with quality  cost effective products in a timely manner or in sufficient volumes to meet customer demand  our business and operating results may be harmed 
we maintain a limited in house manufacturing capability for performing materials procurement  final assembly  testing  quality assurance and shipping 
we rely primarily on independent subcontractors to manufacture our products and we intend to continue our reliance upon third party manufacturers in the future 
some of our products are manufactured in their entirety by third parties 
our reliance on third party manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of existing and new products and reduced control over delivery schedules  product quality  and product cost 
for example  in december  we announced our decision to exit the port replicator business due in part to quality problems associated with the third party manufacturer of this product 
our decision to exit the port replicator business was the primary cause of the decline in our net revenue in the quarter ended december  if our third party suppliers fail to make deliveries that meet our manufacturing schedules  our business may be harmed 
we rely on third party suppliers for components used in our products 
because the manufacturing of our products can involve long lead times  in the event of unanticipated increases in demand for our products  we could be unable to obtain product components quickly enough to manufacture particular products in a quantity sufficient to meet customer demand 
as a result  our business may be harmed 
some of the components used in our products  including particular semiconductor components and infrared transmission components  are currently available from a limited number of suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in obtaining components from suppliers due to increased industry demand and a lack of available supply 
we are currently experiencing some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of flash memory for our printing solutions products and some components commonly used in the manufacture of mobile phones  such as resistors and capacitors  for our wireless connectivity products 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries  increased costs or other circumstances that would require us to seek alternative suppliers could impair our ability to ship our products on a timely basis 
this could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and increase the manufacturing cost of our products  either of which would harm our business 
we rely upon third party distributors and resellers  who may not devote resources to adequately support our products 
we sell some of our products  mainly our printing solutions products  primarily through distributors and resellers 
our success depends on the continued sales efforts of our network of distributors and resellers 
some of our existing distributors currently distribute  or may in the future distribute  the products of our competitors 
these third party distributors may not recommend our products or may not devote sufficient resources to market or adequately support our products 
we provide most of our distributors and resellers with limited product return rights for stock rotation and with some price protection rights 
we may experience significant returns in the future and we may not make adequate allowances to offset these returns 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for these products 
the short life cycles of our products and the difficulty in predicting future sales increase the risk that new product introductions  price reductions by us or our competitors or other factors affecting the markets in which we compete could result in significant product returns 
for example  in the quarter ended december   we discontinued our mechanical port replicator products 
as a result  we recorded million in after tax charges for product returns  an allowance for product returns and an increase in the inventory valuation allowance for port replicators 
our distributors maintain inventory of the products they purchase from us 
changes in inventory management policies at any of our key distributors could harm our business 
we depend on non exclusive licenses for some of the technology we use with our products 
we license technology on a non exclusive basis from several companies for use with our products and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
for example  we license authentication and encryption technology from certicom corporation  which we include in our xtndconnect server products 
our inability to continue to license this technology  or to license other necessary technology for use with our products  could result in the loss of or delays in the inclusion of important features of our products or result in substantial increases in royalty payments that we would have to pay pursuant to alternative third party licenses  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of licensed software in conjunction with our products 
any undetected errors in products resulting from this licensed software may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions and injure our reputation 
we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  and short product life cycles 
any delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business 
the product development process involves a number of risks 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
international sales and operations represent a substantial portion of our net revenue 
our business may be harmed due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales 
for the year ended june   net revenue from sales outside of north america accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including changes in government regulations  export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country and lead to a reduction in sales in that country  longer collection and payment cycles than those in the united states  difficulty in staffing and managing international operations  and political and economic instability  including instability caused by the european monetary union and military actions 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the transactions made through our subsidiaries in france  germany  italy  the netherlands and the united kingdom are primarily denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  these international operations expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations which in turn could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the euro and british pound  to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations resulting from intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries 
the success of these hedging activities depends upon estimates of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
if enterprises and individuals are reluctant to use the internet to manage information  it will harm sales of some of our products 
sales of some of our products  including our mobile data management and our enterprise internet products in particular  largely depend upon on the increased use of the internet by enterprises as replacements for  or enhancements to  their private networks 
however  enterprises may be reluctant to use internet services or applications for functions that are important for their operations 
if enterprises determine that our mobile data management and enterprise internet products do not provide adequate security for dissemination of information over the internet  or if for any other reason customers fail to accept our applications and services for use over the internet  our business could be harmed 
the complex computer software and hardware products that we produce may contain defects for which we may be liable 
software and computer hardware products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
these errors could result in dissatisfied customers  product liability claims and the loss of or delay in market acceptance of new or enhanced products  any of which could harm our business 
testing of our products is particularly challenging because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which our customers may deploy our products 
for example  our mobile information management products are used in a wide variety of telecommunications environments 
changes in technology standards or an increase in the number of telecommunications technologies used in the marketplace may create compatibility issues with our products and our customers environments 
accordingly  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors could be found after commencement of commercial shipment 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could result in our payment of significant legal fees and damages  which would harm our business 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our business will suffer 
any growth we experience is likely to place a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and to increase demands on our systems and controls  which could harm our business 
growth may also result in an increase in the scope of responsibility for management personnel 
we anticipate that growth and expansion will require us to recruit  hire  train and retain a substantial number of new engineering  executive  sales and marketing personnel 
in the current employment environment we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  and continued difficulty in this regard could limit our ability to grow 
in addition  in order to manage our growth successfully  we will need to continue to expand and improve our operational  management and financial systems and controls 
the failure to do so could harm our business 
we may not be able to adequately protect our patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights from competitors  and we may be required to use a significant amount of our resources to defend ourselves from infringement claims made by others 
our patents  trademarks or copyrights may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and the rights granted under these patents  trademarks and copyrights may not provide us with any competitive advantage  which could harm our business 
any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims we are seeking  if at all 
in addition  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around our patents 
further  effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some countries outside of the united states 
if a court finds that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities  which could harm our business 
as a result  we might be required to seek licenses from other companies or to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling specific products or using specific processes 
holders of patents and other intellectual property rights may not offer licenses to use their patents or other intellectual property rights on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all could harm our business 
in order to protect our proprietary rights  we may decide to sue third parties 
any litigation  whether brought by or against us  could cause us to incur significant expenses and could divert a large amount of management time and effort 
a claim by us against a third party could in turn cause a counterclaim by the third party against us  which could impair our intellectual property rights and harm our business 
the loss of key personnel  or our inability to attract and retain additional personnel  may harm our business 
our success depends upon the continuing contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of key management or technical personnel could harm our business 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we believe that our success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
in particular  we are currently attempting to recruit new engineering personnel  however  we may not be successful at hiring or retaining these personnel 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of us  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation divides the board of directors into three classes  each serving a staggered three year term  and does not permit action by written consent of the stockholders or cumulative voting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
while we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
further  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments are at fixed interest rates and  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
all of our liquid investments mature within days or less of june   therefore  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of liquid investments is minimal 
our capital lease is recorded at a fixed interest rate and  therefore  its fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates 
because it expires in september  we believe that the market risk associated with our capital lease is minimal 
sales made by our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the foreign country s currency with the exception of our singapore subsidiary 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies could materially harm our business 
from time to time  we enter into currency forward contracts to hedge payments and receipts of currencies related to the purchase and sale of goods to our international subsidiaries  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  these fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
we had million in forward contracts in place against the euro and british pound sterling at june  that mature within days 
we had no forward contracts in place at june  the success of these hedging activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses
