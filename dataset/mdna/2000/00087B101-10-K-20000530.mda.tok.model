the slower rate of growth in fiscal was due to mild weather conditions in colorado and a combination of weather related factors in florida and texas 
such was the case in fiscal in the southeast along with a post olympic building slowdown in georgia 
through fiscal  the majority of the company s sales growth had resulted from internal expansion of branch operations rather than from acquisitions  but in fiscal and  respectively  and of the increase in sales was attributable to operations acquired since january in fiscal  internal expansion of branch operations again accounted for the sales growth  a steady though less spectacular increase 
the company s gross margin percentage increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal and in fiscal the continual increase in gross margin percentage from fiscal is a result of management s effort to focus the company on starting and acquiring businesses that are expected to enhance the company s gross margin percentage

included in these expenditures was the purchase of additional production machinery at the company s manufacturing operations  indicative of the company s efforts to expand in its manufacturing capabilities 
the company has approximately million in tax loss carryforwards which substantially expire by fiscal such operating loss carryforwards will substantially limit the company s federal income tax liabilities in the near future 
certain provisions of the internal revenue code code regulate the amount of additional stock that the company could issue without resulting in a change in ownership control  as defined in the code 
should such a change in control be deemed to occur  the company s ability to utilize its operating loss carryforwards would be severely restricted 
the company expects that cash flows from operations and the borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its normal operating requirements  debt service and expected capital expenditures 
subject to limitations set forth in its loan agreement with the bank  funds available under the company s revolving credit facility may also be utilized to finance acquisitions 
management is also reviewing the suitability of several acquisition and other business opportunities  but has not entered into any definitive agreements that would require a material financial commitment 
seasonality the company s sales volume and  accordingly  its operating income vary significantly during its fiscal year 
the highest levels of sales occur during the times of the year when climatic conditions require the greatest use of air conditioning  since the company s operations are concentrated in the warmer regions of the united states 
accordingly  sales will be highest in the company s second quarter ending august  and will be lowest in its fourth fiscal quarter 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  manufacturer price increases attributable to inflation uniformly affect both the company and its competitors  and such increases are passed through to customers as an increase in sales prices 
year issue prior to december   the company undertook various measures to address its state of readiness to deal with the problem commonly known as the year issue 
such measures included installing an upgrade to its existing integrated application software and  at one of the company s subsidiaries that does not use the company s integrated software  purchasing new computer hardware and migrating the subsidiary s computer programs to the new hardware 
the costs incurred by the company to achieve year compliance were less than  and were expensed as incurred 
upon transitioning to year in january  the company did not experience any related problems in its internal operations 
to date  the company has experienced no adverse effects as a result of suppliers  customers or service providers failing to adequately address the year issue and further received assurances from its most significant suppliers that they were able to meet customer demands 
while management believes that it took adequate steps to address the year issue  there can be no assurance that such problems may not arise in the future 
should year issues ultimately have a material adverse impact on significant business partners or key parties that provide the country s business and public service infrastructure  the company s operations could be similarly affected
