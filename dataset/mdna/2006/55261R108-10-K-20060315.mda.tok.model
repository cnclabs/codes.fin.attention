item a 
risk factors the company is subject to certain risks 
in addition to the factors discussed below  please see the discussion under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk beginning on page these risks and uncertainties  along with the other information in our form k  should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision  its chartering authority  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation  as insurer of its deposits 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage  and are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our common stock 
regulatory authorities have broad discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the authority to impose restrictions on our operations  to classify our assets which may affect the level of our allowance for loan losses  to limit our dividends or impose higher capital requirements on us  to limit acquisition activities we may propose and to impose penalties for noncompliance 
in addition  we are likely to continue to incur significant operational costs related to compliance as the risks and burden of regulatory compliance have increased significantly in recent years 
regulatory changes  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
unanticipated changes in interest rates could reduce our profitability and affect the value of our assets 
our net interest income  which is our primary source of revenue  depends on the spread between the interest we earn on loans and investments and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings 
for this reason  the level of our earnings is highly susceptible to changes in interest rates which generally impact our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities differently 
while we actively manage this sensitivity to interest rate risk as a key part of our business strategy  unanticipated changes in interest rates and changes in the yield curve may have a material adverse affect on our results of operation 
changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate mortgage loans  the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of loans 
competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our growth and profitability 
the banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in each of our markets from many other financial institutions 
we compete with community banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  mortgage brokers  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds  and other mutual funds  as well as other regional  super regional  national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary 
table of contents market areas and elsewhere 
while we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions in our primary markets  we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of lesser geographic diversification and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market 
we compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
a key part of our strategy is to compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements  broad product offerings  community support  personal contacts  and flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers  but competition has made it more difficult for us to grow our customer base without adjusting our pricing 
in addition  in recent years we have encountered many de novo banks in our market areas that tend to price their loans and deposits aggressively in order to attract customers 
price competition for loans and deposits causes us to earn less on our loans and pay more on our deposits  which reduces net interest income 
if the value of real estate in the suburban chicago and suburban milwaukee areas were to decline precipitously  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
with most of our real estate loans concentrated in suburban chicago and suburban milwaukee areas  a decline in local economic conditions or the demand for real estate in these markets could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing our loans 
a decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover fully on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral and we might suffer greater losses on defaulted loans as a result 
a decline in local economic and market conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse 
high loan to value ratios on a growing portion of our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios expose us to greater risk of loss 
a growing number of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity which may lead to a higher incidence of default on these loans 
some of our mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit may have  either alone or when added to existing senior lien balances  a post funding combined loan to value ratio of up to of the value of the home securing the loan 
at december   approximately million  or  of our billion single family residential mortgage loan portfolio  including equity loans  had original loan to value ratios in excess of based on total line available and no private mortgage insurance 
depending on our loan sale activity and customer usage of undrawn equity lines  based on current origination trends we expect that the percent of our loan portfolio comprised of higher loan to value loans is likely to increase in we may experience a higher risk of loss on these loans since our ability to recover against the collateral is more sensitive to declining property values than for loans with lower combined loan to value ratios 
our ability to service our holding company debt and pay dividends to our shareholders is substantially dependent on dividends from the bank  and these dividends are subject to regulatory limits 
since january   we have added an additional million of debt at our holding company as part of our capital management strategy designed to increase shareholder returns 
we are largely dependent on the receipt of dividends from mid america bank in order to service this debt and the availability of dividends from the bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
in the event that the bank is unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to service our debt  fund additional real estate development activities  complete planned stock buybacks or pay dividends on our common stock 
our allowance for loan losses is based on our estimates of future losses inherent in our portfolio  and actual losses we incur could exceed these estimates 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses we deem adequate to cover losses inherent in our portfolio from loans that may not be repaid in their entirety 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis  in addition to numerous quantitative factors we take into account  we also consider many qualitative factors  such as general business and economic conditions  general real estate market trends and other matters which are by their nature more subjective and susceptible to change 
in addition  our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on 
table of contents some of our commercial loans require us to assess our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors outside our control 
because of the degree of uncertainty in the assumptions we make and the factors we consider  the losses we actually incur may exceed our estimates and our allowance for loan losses may prove insufficient to absorb these losses 
income from our real estate development business has proven more volatile in recent periods than other sources of income 
historically  a significant source of our non interest income has been income from our real estate development projects involving the acquisition and development of raw land into residential lots for sale to home builders 
we often develop these projects in multiple phases over a period of years and must obtain municipal zoning  engineering and other approvals to proceed with our plans 
we do not control the municipal process and may not be able to accurately predict the timing and cost involved  particularly in communities where the process may be less well established like we have encountered with our springbank project in plainfield  illinois 
delays in the approval process  as well as potential weather related or other delays outside our control  may prolong the project timeline and increase our development costs and may interfere with the planned marketing of lots in different units 
while we believe our real estate development activities offer us opportunity for attractive return on the capital we invest in this business  delays have caused more volatility to our income from real estate development in and than in prior years when our projects were not as large 
we are likely to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations in earnings in as we expect higher income from real estate development in the second half of the year based on current estimates of the timing of anticipated lot sale closings in our springbank project 
our acquisition strategy exposes us to certain risks 
we have acquired a number of other banking companies in recent years and we may pursue selective acquisitions of other financial institutions in the future 
acquisitions can present certain managerial and operational challenges 
while we evaluate acquisition opportunities across a variety of parameters  including our assessment of the potential impact on our financial condition as well as our prospective financial performance  our results may suffer as a result of an acquisition if we are not effective in integrating the acquired operations into our business and converting data processing systems to our platform as planned  or if we fail to achieve anticipated cost savings or revenue enhancements 
in addition  we anticipate that future acquisitions  if any  will likely be valued at a premium to book value and at a premium to current market value  which may result in book value per share dilution and possible short term earnings per share dilution for our shareholders depending on the transaction structure and pricing 
breaches of our computer and network security may result in compromises of information which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend heavily in our daily operations on our automated information systems  networks and telecommunications systems which support the evaluation  acquisition  monitoring  collection and administration of our loan and deposit servicing portfolios  general accounting and other management controls 
we also outsource some data and payment processing to third parties 
while we have implemented extensive policies and procedures designed to limit the impact of system failures or disruptions as well as information security measures to safeguard these systems  if we or our vendors encounter technological difficulties or security breaches  our ability to accurately process and account for customer transactions and to protect customer personal information could be compromised  and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  a failure or interruption of these systems or a failure of data integrity could subject us to customer complaints  potential lawsuits or increased regulatory scrutiny and could damage our reputation  making it more difficult for us to compete successfully
