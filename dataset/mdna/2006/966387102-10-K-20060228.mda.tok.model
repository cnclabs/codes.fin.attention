overview we are engaged in oil and natural gas exploitation  acquisition  exploration and production activities primarily in the permian basin  rocky mountains  mid continent  gulf coast and michigan regions of the united states 
over the last five years  we have emphasized the acquisition of properties that provided current production and significant upside potential through further development 
our drilling activity is directed at this development  specifically on projects that we believe provide repeatable successes in particular fields 
our combination of acquisitions and development allows us to direct our capital resources to what we believe to be the most advantageous investments 
during periods of radically changing prices  we focus our emphasis on drilling and development of our owned properties 
when prices stabilize  we generally direct the majority of our capital to acquisitions 
we have historically acquired operated as well as non operated properties that meet or exceed our rate of return criteria 
for acquisitions of properties with additional development  exploitation and exploration potential  our focus has been on acquiring operated properties so that we can better control the timing and implementation of capital spending 
in some instances  we have been able to acquire non operated property interests at attractive rates of return that provided a foothold in a new area of interest or that have complemented our existing operations 
we intend to continue to acquire both operated and non operated interests to the extent we believe they meet our return criteria 
in addition  our willingness to acquire non operated properties in new geographic regions provides us with geophysical and geologic data in some cases that leads to further acquisitions in the same region  whether on an operated or non operated basis 
we sell properties when we are of the opinion that the sale price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own 
our revenue  profitability and future growth rate depend on factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 

table of contents acquisitions we completed four separate acquisitions of producing properties during the combined purchase price for these four acquisitions was million for total estimated proved reserves as of the effective dates of the acquisitions of approximately mmboe 
because of our substantial recent acquisition activity  our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods discussed below may not necessarily be comparable with or applicable to our future results of operations 
our historical results include the results from our recent acquisitions beginning on the following dates north ward estes and ancillary properties  october   postle properties  august   limited partnership interests  june   and green river basin  march  north ward estes and ancillary properties on october   we acquired the operated interest in the north ward estes field in ward and winkler counties  texas  and certain smaller fields located in the permian basin from celero

year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales revenue increased million to million in sales are a function of sales volumes and average sales prices 
our sales volumes increased between periods on a boe basis 
the volume increase resulted primarily from acquisition activities and successful drilling activities over the past year that produced new sales volumes that more than offset natural field production decline 
our production volumes for were slightly less than anticipated due in part to delays in rig availability that caused delays in our development drilling program and temporary pipeline shut downs and workover activity in the first quarter of hurricanes katrina and rita caused only minor reductions to our sales volumes  in that only  boe of total estimated production was lost during due to the hurricanes 
our average price for natural gas sales increased and our average price for crude oil increased between periods 
loss on oil and gas hedging activities 
we hedged of our natural gas volumes during incurring a hedging loss of million and of our natural gas volumes during incurring no hedging loss or gain 
we hedged of our oil volumes during incurring a hedging loss of million  and of our oil volumes during incurring a hedging loss of million 
see item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for a list of our outstanding oil and natural gas hedges as of february  gain on sale of marketable securities 
during  we sold all of our holdings in delta petroleum  inc  which trades publicly under the symbol dptr 
we realized gross proceeds of million and recognized a gain on sale of million 
during  we had no investments in marketable securities 
gain on sale of oil and gas properties 
during  we sold certain undeveloped acreage in wyoming 
no value had been assigned to the acreage when we acquired it over five years ago 
as a result  the recognized gain on sale was equal to the gross proceeds of million 

table of contents lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expense increased million to million in compared to the increase resulted primarily from costs associated with new property acquisitions over the past year 
our lease operating expense as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales increased slightly from during to during our lease operating expenses per boe increased from during to during the increase of was mainly caused by higher costs for electric power and increases in the cost of oil field goods and services due to higher demand in the industry 
in addition  our lease operating expenses increased on a boe basis due to the newly acquired postle and north ward estes properties  which had fourth quarter combined operating costs of per boe relating to the secondary and tertiary recovery projects underway on those fields 
production taxes 
the production taxes we pay are generally calculated as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales revenue before the effects of hedging 
we take full advantage of all credits and exemptions allowed in the various taxing jurisdictions 
our production taxes for and were and of oil and natural gas sales  respectively 
the increase in tax rates between periods was related to product price increases that eliminate certain exemptions and move us into higher tax tiers in our various tax jurisdictions  which effect was partially offset by lower production taxes on our properties newly acquired in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a increased million to million during as compared to million for the increase resulted from increased production due to our recent acquisitions and an increase in our dd a rate 
on a boe basis  the rate increased from during to in the primary factors causing the dd a rate increase were the higher costs of adding proved developed reserves in  the increase in drilling expenditures including the development of proved undeveloped reserves  the costs of which are not considered for dd a purposes until incurred  and downward net reserve revisions 
changes to the pricing environment can also positively impact our dd a rate 
price increases allow for longer economic production lives and corresponding increased reserve volumes and  as a result  lower depletion rates 
price decreases have the opposite effect 
the components of our dd a expense were as follows in thousands year ended december  depletion depreciation accretion of asset retirement obligations total exploration and impairment 
our exploration and impairment costs increased million to million in compared to year ended december  exploration impairment total higher exploratory costs resulted from seven exploratory dry holes drilled during totaling million  as compared to two exploratory dry holes in totaling million 
we also hired additional geological and geophysical personnel to support the increased drilling budget from million in to million in the impairment charge in relates primarily to unrecoverable costs associated with our investment in the cherokee basin of kansas 
the impairment charge in was for the write down of cost associated with the high island field located off the coast of texas 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
we report general and administrative expenses net of reimbursements 
the components of our general and administrative expenses were as follows in thousands year ended december  general and administrative expenses reimbursements general and administrative expenses  net general and administrative expenses before reimbursements increased million to million during compared to million during the largest components of the increase related to higher costs for personnel salaries  benefits and related taxes of million  an increase in the current year cash payment under our production participation plan of million and the amortization of restricted stock compensation of million 
personnel salary expenses were higher in due primarily to an increase in our employee base resulting from our continued growth 
the increased cost of the production participation plan was caused primarily by higher production volumes and higher average sales prices between years 
restricted stock compensation increased due to the additional issuance of restricted stock in and due to the layering impact of a multiple year vesting schedule 
the increase in reimbursements in was caused by a higher number of operated properties due to acquisitions and drilling activities during the last half of and our net general and administrative expenses on a boe basis increased between periods from to 
as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales  our general and administrative expenses decreased from during to during  as general and administrative costs increased at a slower rate than oil and natural gas sales prices 
change in production participation plan liability 
for the year ended december   this non cash expense increased million to million from million during this expense represents the change in the vested present value of estimated future payments to be made to participants after under its production participation plan 
although payments take place over the life of oil and natural gas properties contributed to the plan  some properties for over years  we must expense the present value of estimated future payments over the plan s five year vesting period 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the expense related to the long term portion of the production participation plan liability should be presented separately from general and administrative and exploration expenses because of its significance and because the long term portion of this liability is calculated based on estimated net cash flows to be realized from the future production of oil and natural gas and as such is not currently payable  unlike other general and administrative or exploration expenses 
as a result of this reclassification  general and administrative expense and exploration expenses exclude changes in the long term portion of the production participation plan liability and include only those amounts paid or accrued under the production participation plan that relate to current period oil and natural gas operations 
the increase in expense primarily reflects changes to future cash flows estimates due to the effect of a sustained higher price environment and acquisitions during assumptions that are used to calculate this liability are subject to estimation and will vary from year to year based on the current market for oil and natural gas prices  discount rates and overall market conditions 
interest expense 
the components of our interest expense were as follows in thousands year ended december  credit agreement senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due alliant energy amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount capitalized interest accretion of tax sharing liability total interest expense the increase in interest expense was mainly due to the may issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due  the april issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due  the october issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due  and additional borrowings outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement 
the additional amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount in was due to the greater number of days that each instrument was outstanding versus the 
table of contents prior year 
in august of  million of the face amount of the senior subordinated notes due notes were swapped to a floating rate 
at november   the floating rate component was set at through may  our weighted average debt outstanding during was million versus million during our weighted average effective cash interest rate was during versus after inclusion of non cash interest costs related to the amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount and the accretion of the tax sharing liability  our weighted average effective all in interest rate was during versus during income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million for and million for  resulting in effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
we were able to defer the majority of our cash income tax obligations due to the level of our drilling expenditures in each year 
we reported current income tax expense of million in or of the tax provision  as compared to million or of the tax provision in the lower rate of current income tax expense in was mainly due to the use of our net operating loss carryforward in net income 
net income increased from million during to million during the primary reasons for this increase included higher crude oil and natural gas prices net of hedging between periods and a increase in equivalent volumes sold  which were partially offset by higher lease operating expenses  production taxes  dd a  exploration and impairment  general and administrative  production participation plan and interest expenses in resulting from our continued growth 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas sales 
our oil and natural gas sales revenue increased million to million in our sales volumes increased between periods on a boe basis 
the volume increase resulted from successful drilling and acquisition activities over the past year that produced new sales volumes that more than offset natural field decline 
our average price for natural gas sales increased and our average price for crude oil increased between periods 
loss on oil and gas hedging activities 
we hedged of our natural gas volumes during incurring no hedging gains or losses  and of our natural gas volumes during incurring a hedging loss of million 
we hedged of our oil volumes during incurring a hedging loss of million  and of our oil volumes during incurring a loss of million 
gain on sale of marketable securities 
during  we sold all of our holdings in delta petroleum  inc  which trades publicly under the symbol dptr 
we realized gross proceeds of million and recognized a gain on sale of million 
at december   we had no investments in marketable securities 
gain on sale of oil and gas properties 
during the third quarter of  we sold certain undeveloped acreage in wyoming 
no value had been assigned to the acreage when we acquired it over five years ago 
as a result  the recognized gain on sale is equal to the gross proceeds of million 
lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses per boe decreased from during to during the decrease was less than  which represented improved operating efficiency more than offsetting price inflation caused by increased demand for goods and services in the industry 
our fourth quarter lease operating expense per boe was  indicating that the seven acquisitions we completed during the third and fourth quarters of did not significantly affect our rate 
production taxes 
the production taxes we pay are generally calculated as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales revenue before the effects of hedging 
we take full advantage of all credits and exemptions allowed in the various taxing jurisdictions 
our production taxes for and were and of oil and natural gas sales  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a increased from million to million in the increase resulted from higher production volumes and an increase in the dd a rate  as well as the effects of our recent acquisitions 
on a boe basis  the rate increased from during to in the increase in rate is primarily due to property acquisitions  which we purchased at an average cost of per boe  which was higher than our historical rate 
changes to the pricing 
table of contents environment can also impact our dd a rate 
price increases allow for longer economic production lives and corresponding increased reserve volumes and  as a result  lower depletion rates 
price decreases have the opposite effect 
the components of our dd a expense were as follows in thousands year ended december  depletion depreciation accretion of asset retirement obligations total exploration and impairment costs 
our exploration and impairment costs increased million to million in the higher exploratory costs were related to our increased purchases of seismic data in to support our increased drilling budget 
the impairment charge represents the write down of cost associated with the high island field located off the coast of texas 
year ended december  exploration impairment total general and administrative expenses 
we report general and administrative expenses net of reimbursements 
the components of our general and administrative expenses were as follows year ended december  general and administrative expenses reimbursements general and administrative expenses  net general and administrative expenses before reimbursements increased million to million during the largest components of the increase related to higher costs for personnel salaries  benefits and related taxes of million  an increase in the current year cash payment related to our production participation plan of million and an increase in the amortization of restricted stock compensation of million 
personnel salary expenses were higher in due primarily to an increase in our employee base due to our continued growth 
the increased cost of the production participation plan was caused primarily by higher production volumes and higher oil and natural gas sales prices between years 
we recognized restricted stock compensation expense in but not in  since this was the first year that we issued restricted stock and incurred an amortization charge 
on a boe basis  the increase between years was from to 
the increase in reimbursements was caused by a higher number of operated properties due to property acquisitions and was also caused by an increase in development drilling 
change in production participation plan liability 
for the year ended december   this non cash expense increased million 
this expense represents the change in the vested present value of estimated future payments to be made to participants after under its production participation plan 
although payments take place over the life of oil and natural gas properties contributed to the plan  some properties for over years  we must expense the present value of estimated future payments over the plan s five year vesting period 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the expense related to the long term portion of the production participation plan liability should be presented separately from general and administrative and exploration expenses because of its significance and because the long term portion of this liability is calculated based on estimated net cash flows to be realized from the future production of oil and natural gas and as such is not currently payable  unlike other general and 
table of contents administrative or exploration expenses 
as a result of the reclassification  general and administrative expense and exploration expenses exclude changes in the long term portion of the production participation plan liability and include only those amounts paid or accrued under the production participation plan that relate to current period oil and natural gas operations 
the increase in expense primarily reflects changes to future cash flows estimates due a higher price environment and acquisitions during assumptions that are used to calculate this liability are subject to estimation and will vary from year to year based on the current market for oil and natural gas prices  discount rates and overall market conditions 
interest expense 
the components of our interest expense were as follows year ended december  senior subordinated notes due credit agreement alliant energy corporation accretion of tax sharing liability amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount capitalized interest total interest expense the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the may issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due in august of  million of the face amount of the notes was swapped to a floating rate 
the effect of the swap in was to lower our overall effective interest rate on this debt from to approximately 
at december   the floating rate component was set at through may   yielding a weighted average effective interest rate of on the million senior subordinated notes interest expense on our credit agreement in was million less than this was primarily the result of average outstanding borrowings in being million lower than the effective cash interest rate paid in each year on the credit agreement was approximately 
the decrease in interest expense related to alliant energy corporation  our former parent company  was due to the march  conversion of million of intercompany debt into our equity 
the accretion of our tax sharing liability is related to a step up in tax basis effected immediately prior to our initial public offering in november the increase was due to a full year of accretion expense in the increase in debt issue and debt discount amortization was due to the amortization of additional fees in to refinance our credit agreement and issue million in senior subordinated notes due income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million for and million for  resulting in effective income tax rates of for both years 
the current portion of income tax expense was million in compared to million in these amounts are and of the total income tax expense for the respective periods 
prior to our initial public offering in november  we were included in the consolidated federal income tax return of alliant energy  but for financial reporting purposes  we calculated our income tax expense on a separate return basis at alliant energy s effective income tax rate 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  alliant energy effected a step up in the tax basis of whiting oil and gas corporation s assets  which had the result of increasing our future tax deductions 
these additional deductions  combined with an increase in intangible drilling costs  allowed us to lower the percentage of taxes paid currently  even with the significant increase in oil and natural gas prices between years 
cumulative change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and requires us to recognize the fair value of asset retirement obligations in our financial statements by capitalizing that cost as a part of the cost of the related asset 
this statement applies directly to plug and abandonment liabilities associated with our net working interest in oil and natural gas properties 
the additional carrying amount is depleted over the estimated useful lives of the properties 
the discounted liability is based on historical abandonment costs in specific areas and the discount is accreted at the end of each accounting period 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an increase to our discounted asset retirement obligations of million  increased proved property cost by million and recognized a one time cumulative effect charge of million net of a deferred tax benefit of million

liquidity and capital resources overview 
we entered with million of cash and cash equivalents 
during  we generated million from operating activities and million from financing activities 
we used these sources of cash primarily to finance drilling expenditures and acquisition capital expenditures of  million 
at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was  we had million of cash on hand and million of stockholders equity 
we continually evaluate our capital needs and compare them to our capital resources 
our budgeted capital expenditures for the further development of our property base are million  an increase from the million spent on capitalized development during our development spending was a increase from the million spent on capitalized development costs during we also spent million on acquisitions in  funded primarily by our senior subordinated notes and common stock offerings as well as additional borrowings under whiting oil and gas corporation s credit agreement 
although we have no specific budget for property acquisitions in  we will continue to seek property acquisition opportunities that complement our existing core property base 
we expect to fund our development expenditures from internally generated cash flow and cash on hand 
we believe that should attractive acquisition opportunities arise or development expenditures exceed million  we are able to finance additional capital expenditures with cash on hand  operating cash flow  borrowings under our credit agreement  issuances of additional equity or agreements with industry partners 
our level of capital expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly depending on available opportunities  commodity prices  cash flows and development results  among other factors 
credit agreement 
whiting oil and gas corporation has a billion credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that  as of december   had a borrowing base of million 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is determined by the discretion of the lenders based on the collateral value of our proved reserves and is subject to regular redeterminations on may and november of each year  as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under the credit agreement was million 
the credit agreement provides for interest only payments until august   when the entire amount borrowed is due 
we may  throughout the five year term of the credit agreement  borrow  repay and re borrow up to the borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the lenders under the credit agreement have also committed to issue letters of credit for the account of whiting oil and gas corporation or other designated subsidiaries of ours from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
as of december   letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the credit agreement 
interest accrues  at our option  at either the base rate plus a margin where the base rate is defined as the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus and the margin varies from to depending on the utilization percentage of the borrowing base  or at the libor rate plus a margin where the margin varies from to depending on the utilization percentage of the borrowing base 
we have consistently chosen the libor rate option since it delivers the lowest effective interest rate 
commitment fees of to accrue on the unused portion of the borrowing base  depending on the utilization percentage and are included as a component of interest expense 
at december   the effective weighted average interest rate on the entire outstanding principal balance under the credit agreement was 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to  among other things  pay cash dividends  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  make loans to others  make investments  enter into mergers  enter into hedging contracts  change material agreements  incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the 
table of contents prior consent of the lenders and requires us to maintain a debt to ebitdax as defined in the credit agreement ratio of less than to and a working capital ratio as defined in the credit agreement of greater than to except for limited exceptions  including the payment of interest on the senior notes  the credit agreement restricts the ability of whiting oil and gas corporation and equity oil company to make any dividends  distributions or other payments to us 
the restrictions apply to all of the net assets of these subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with our covenants under the credit agreement as of december  the credit agreement is secured by a first lien on all of whiting oil and gas corporation s properties included in the borrowing base for the credit agreement 
we and our wholly owned subsidiary  equity oil company  have guaranteed the obligations of whiting oil and gas under the credit agreement 
we have pledged the stock of whiting oil and gas corporation and equity oil company as security for our guarantee  and equity oil company has mortgaged all of its properties included in the borrowing base for the credit agreement as security for its guarantee 
senior subordinated notes 
on october   we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due we used the net proceeds of million from this offering along with the net proceeds of million from the common stock offering discussed below to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the north ward estes and ancillary properties and to repay million of debt under whiting oil and gas corporation s credit agreement that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of the postle properties 
the senior subordinated notes due were issued at par 
on april   we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes due were issued at of par and the associated discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
in may  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes due were issued at of par and the associated discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
the notes are unsecured obligations of ours and are subordinated to all of our senior debt 
the indentures governing the notes contain restrictive covenants that may limit our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  pay cash dividends  redeem or repurchase our capital stock or our subordinated debt  make investments  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  sell assets  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of ours and our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole and enter into hedging contracts 
these covenants may limit the discretion of our management in operating our business 
in addition  whiting oil and gas corporation s credit agreement restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain payments  including principal on the notes  to us 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  three of our subsidiaries  whiting oil and gas corporation  whiting programs  inc and equity oil company  have fully  unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed our obligations under the notes 
common stock offering 
on october   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
the offering was priced at per share to the public 
the number of shares includes the sale of  shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we used the net proceeds from the offering of million along with the net proceeds from the senior subordinated notes due of million to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the north ward estes and ancillary properties and to repay million of debt outstanding under whiting oil and gas corporation s credit agreement that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of the postle properties 
alliant energy promissory note 
in conjunction with our initial public offering in november  we issued a promissory note payable to alliant energy corporation  our former parent company  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
we paid all principal and interest on the promissory note on november  tax separation and indemnification agreement with alliant energy 
in connection with our initial public offering in november  we entered into a tax separation and indemnification agreement with alliant energy 
pursuant to this agreement  we and alliant energy made a tax election with the effect that the tax basis of the assets of whiting oil and gas corporation and its subsidiaries were increased to the deemed purchase price of their assets immediately prior to such initial public offering 
we have adjusted deferred taxes on our balance sheet to reflect the new tax bases of our assets 
these additional bases are expected to result in increased future income tax deductions and  accordingly  may reduce income taxes otherwise payable by us 
under this agreement  we have agreed to pay to alliant energy of the future tax benefits we realize annually as a result of this step up in tax bases for the years 
table of contents ending on or prior to december  such tax benefits will generally be calculated by comparing our actual taxes to the taxes that would have been owed by us had the increase in bases not occurred 
in  we will be obligated to pay alliant energy the present value of the remaining tax benefits assuming all such tax benefits will be realized in future years 
the initial recording of this transaction in november resulted in a million increase in deferred tax assets  a million discounted payable to alliant energy and a million increase to stockholders equity 
during  we made a payment of million under this agreement 
our estimate of payments to be made under this agreement of million in is reflected as a current liability at december  contractual obligations and commitments schedule of contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our material obligations and commitments as of december  to make future payments under certain contracts  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods 
this table does not include asset retirement obligations or production participation plan liabilities since we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future payments 
this table also does not include cash interest expense under our credit agreement since this is a floating rate instrument and we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances  repayments or interest rates

b cash interest expense on the senior subordinated notes due and and the senior subordinated notes due is estimated assuming no principal repayment until the due date of the instruments 
the interest rate swap on the million of our million fixed rate senior subordinated notes due is assumed to equal until the due date of the instrument 
c in july  we entered into a year take or pay supply agreement  whereby we have committed to buy certain volumes of co 

for a fixed fee  subject to annual escalation  for use in enhanced recovery projects on its postle field in texas county  oklahoma 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to purchase a minimum daily volume of co or else pay for any deficiencies at the price in effect when the minimum delivery was to have occurred 
as calculated on an annual basis  whiting s failure to purchase the minimum co 

volumes requires us to pay the supplier for any deficiency 
the co volumes planned for use in the postle field enhanced recovery projects currently exceed the minimum daily volumes provided in this take or pay supply agreement 
therefore  we expect to avoid any payments for deficiencies 
d during  we entered into three separate agreements for three rigs drilling in the us rocky mountain region 
these contracts each have a term of three years  and early termination of these contracts at december  would have required maximum penalties of million 
no other drilling rigs working for us are currently under long term contracts or contracts which cannot be terminated at the end of the well that is currently being drilled 
due to their short term nature and the indeterminate nature of the drilling time remaining on rigs drilling on a well by well basis  such obligations have not been included in this table 
e we have entered into derivative contracts  primarily costless collars  to hedge its exposure to crude oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
as of december   the forward price curves for oil and natural gas generally exceeded the price curves that were in effect when these contracts were entered into  resulting in a derivative fair value current liability of million and long term liability of million 
if current market prices are higher 
table of contents than a collar s price ceiling when the cash settlement amount is calculated  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
the ultimate settlement amounts under our derivative contracts are unknown  however  as they are subject to continuing market risk

price sharing arrangements 
as part of a purchase transaction  we agreed to share with the seller of the actual price received for certain crude oil production in excess of per barrel 
the agreement runs through december  and contains a price escalation per year 
as a result  the sharing amount at january  increased to of the actual price received in excess of per barrel 
as of december   approximately  net barrels of crude oil per month of december net crude oil production are subject to this sharing agreement

new accounting policies in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas no 
as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including restricted stock grants  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies the definition and treatment of conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be outside the control of the company 
fin states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable 
fin is intended to provide more information about long lived assets and future cash outflows for these obligations and more consistent recognition of these liabilities 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced crude oil and natural gas 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received 
however  differences have been insignificant 
hedging 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize costless collars  which are generally placed with major financial institutions 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective and is reclassified to the loss on oil and gas hedging activities line item in our consolidated statements of income in the period that the hedged production is delivered 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in the fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
we currently do not have any derivative contracts in place that do not qualify as cash flow hedges 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations each period can be impacted by our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our hedges did not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment  then our consolidated income statements could include large non cash fluctuations  particularly in volatile pricing environments  as our contracts are marked to their period end market values 
successful efforts accounting 
we account for our oil and natural gas operations using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  all costs associated with property acquisitions  successful exploratory wells and all development wells are capitalized 
items charged to expense generally include geological and geophysical costs  costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells and oil and natural gas production costs 
except for one small property in canada  all of our properties are located within the continental united states and the gulf of mexico 
oil and gas reserve quantities 
reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion  impairment of our oil and natural gas properties  and our long term production participation plan liability 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and fasb 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 

table of contents our proved reserve information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by ryder scott company  cawley  gillespie associates  inc  ra lenser associates  inc  and netherland  sewell associates  inc  each independent petroleum engineers  and our engineering staff 
the independent petroleum engineers evaluated of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our proved reserves as of december  estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ substantially from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
we continually make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional information becomes available 
we make changes to depletion rates  impairment calculations and our production participation plan liability in the same period that changes to the reserve estimates are made 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which incorporate assumptions regarding future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending 
if the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
this decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review the value of our oil and natural gas properties whenever management judges that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable 
we provide for impairments on undeveloped property when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred 
impairments of producing properties are determined by comparing future net undiscounted cash flows to the net book value at the end of each period 
if the net capitalized cost exceeds net future cash flows  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using net discounted future cash flows from the producing property 
different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment 
production participation plan 
we have a production participation plan which benefits all eligible employees 
each year  a deemed economic interest in all oil and natural gas properties acquired or developed during the year is contributed to the plan 
the compensation committee of the board of directors  in its discretion for each plan year  allocates a percentage of net income defined as gross revenues less production taxes  royalties and direct lease operating expenses attributable to such properties to plan participants 
once contributed and allocated  the interests not legally conveyed are fixed for each plan year 
the short term obligation related to the production participation plan is included in the accrued employee compensation and benefits line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
this obligation is based on cash flows during the preceding year and is paid annually in cash after year end 
the calculation of this liability depends in part on our estimates of accrued revenues and costs as of the end of each reporting period as discussed above under revenue recognition 
the vested long term obligation related to the production participation plan is the production participation plan liability line item on the consolidated balance sheet 
this liability is derived primarily from reserve report estimates discounted at  which as discussed above  are subject to revision as more information becomes available 
our price assumptions are currently determined using average prices for the preceding five years 
variances between estimates used to calculate liabilities related to the production participation plan and actual sales  cost and reserve data are integrated into the liability calculations in the period identified 
a increase to the pricing assumptions used in the measurement of this liability at december  would have decreased net income before taxes by million in income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
accounting for business combinations 
our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas no 
 business combinations  and involves the use of significant judgment 

table of contents under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed during the prior two years consisted of oil and natural gas properties or companies with oil and natural gas interests 
the consideration we have paid to acquire these properties or companies was entirely allocated the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
consequently  there was no goodwill to be recognized from any of our business combinations 
asset retirement obligation 
our asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and natural gas properties 
sfas no 
requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
effects of inflation and pricing we experienced increased costs during  and due to increased demand for oil field products and services 
the oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
material changes in prices also impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  continued high prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
based on production  our income before income taxes for would have moved up or down approximately million for every change in natural gas prices and approximately million for each change in crude oil prices 
we periodically enter into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
our derivative contracts have traditionally been costless collars  although we evaluate other forms of derivative instruments as well 
our derivative contracts have historically qualified for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
this accounting treatment allows the aggregate change in fair market value to be recorded as other comprehensive income 
recognition in the consolidated income statement occurs in the period of contract settlement 
we also seek to diversify our hedge position with various counterparties where we have clear indications of their current financial strength 

table of contents our outstanding hedges as of february  are summarized below monthly volume nymex commodity period mmbtu bbl floor ceiling natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  natural gas to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  crude oil to  the collared hedges shown above have the effect of providing a protective floor while allowing us to share in upward pricing movements 
consequently  while these hedges are designed to decrease our exposure to price decreases  they also have the effect of limiting the benefit of price increases beyond the ceiling 
for the natural gas contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the nymex price above the ceiling price or below the floor price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in the gain loss on hedging activities in of million 
for the crude oil contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the nymex price would cause a change in the gain loss on hedging activities in of million 

table of contents we have also entered into fixed price marketing contracts directly with end users for a portion of the natural gas we produce in michigan 
all of those contracts have built in pricing escalators of per year 
our outstanding fixed price marketing contracts at february  are summarized below monthly price volume per commodity period mmbtu mmbtu natural gas to  natural gas to  interest rate risk market risk is estimated as the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rate on the outstanding balance under our credit agreement 
our credit agreement allows us to fix the interest rate for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period up to six months 
to the extent the interest rate is fixed  interest rate changes affect the instrument s fair market value but do not impact results of operations or cash flows 
conversely  for the portion of the credit agreement that has a floating interest rate  interest rate changes will not affect the fair market value but will impact future results of operations and cash flows 
at december   our outstanding principal balance under our credit agreement was million and the weighted average interest rate on the entire outstanding principal balance was fixed at through march  at december   the carrying amount approximated fair market value 
assuming a constant debt level of million  the cash flow impact for resulting from a basis point change in interest rates during periods when the interest rate is not fixed would be million 
interest rate swap in august  we entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge the fair value of million of our senior subordinated notes due because this swap meets the conditions to qualify for the short cut method of assessing effectiveness under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the change in fair value of the debt is assumed to equal the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap 
as such  there is no ineffectiveness assumed to exist between the interest rate swap and the notes 
the interest rate swap is a fixed for floating swap in that we receive the fixed rate of and pay the floating rate 
the floating rate is redetermined every six months based on the libor rate in effect at the contractual reset date 
when libor plus our margin of is less than  we receive a payment from the counterparty equal to the difference in rate times million for the six month period 
when libor plus our margin of is greater than  we pay the counterparty an amount equal to the difference in rate times million for the six month period 
the libor rate at december  was 
as of december   we have recorded a long term liability of million related to the interest rate swap  which has been designated as a fair value hedge  with a corresponding decrease in the carrying value of the senior subordinated notes
