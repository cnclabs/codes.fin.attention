item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hospira is a global specialty pharmaceutical and medication delivery company that is focused on products that improve the productivity  safety and efficacy of patient care in the acute care setting 
hospira is a leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of specialty injectable pharmaceuticals and medication delivery systems that deliver drugs and intravenous iv fluids 
hospira is also a leading provider of contract manufacturing services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for formulation development  filling and finishing of injectable pharmaceuticals 
hospira s broad portfolio of products is used by hospitals and alternate site providers  such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities 
transition from abbott hospira became a separate public company on april   when it was spun off from abbott 
references to the historical assets  liabilities  products  businesses or activities of hospira prior to the spin off are generally intended to refer to the historical assets  liabilities  products  businesses or activities of the business as it was conducted as part of abbott prior to the spin off 
hospira s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  reflect hospira s operations as a separate  stand alone entity subsequent to the spin off  combined with the historical operations of hospira when it operated as part of abbott prior to the spin off 
the financial information in the financial statements included in this annual report does not include all the expenses that would have been incurred  nor does it reflect hospira s results of operations  financial position and cash flows  had hospira been a stand alone company for all of the periods presented 
while hospira was a part of abbott  hospira relied on abbott s corporate infrastructure and administrative functions 
also as part of abbott  hospira was required to compete with abbott s other major businesses for product development funds and other resources 
the level of resources allocated to hospira affected its research and development project funding  manufacturing cost structure  and marketing  promotion and selling activities 
the spin off enabled hospira to focus exclusively on its business and use its own resources to invest in opportunities targeted to its own markets 
hospira views investment in research and development as an important driver of longer term sales growth 
during the month period after the spin off  hospira must build its own corporate and international infrastructure 
costs relating to these activities have been funded  and are expected to continue to be funded  through its operating cash flow 
hospira has incurred increased expenses on an ongoing basis  including expenses relating to establishing and operating independent corporate functions  operating  maintaining and supporting information technology systems  and operating internationally on a stand alone basis 
hospira has experienced higher costs related to information technology support associated with the implementation of sap as hospira s global enterprise resource planning erp system 
hospira expects these higher levels of support costs to continue through it has also incurred expenses on a non recurring  transitional basis  including expenses relating to the establishment of new facilities  the build out of independent information technology systems  and product registration and re labeling 
these transitional costs are estimated to total approximately million pre tax over the month period subsequent to the spin off 
as of december   hospira had incurred million of these costs 
the transitional and ongoing costs also contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from of net sales in to of net sales in hospira has incurred costs in connection with the transfer of legal title of assets outside the united states from abbott to hospira  and will continue to incur these costs through mid hospira views the ability to operate independently outside the united states as a longer term opportunity to increase its sales and profitability 
under transition arrangements with abbott  described under item business arrangements with abbott  the legal transfer of certain operations and assets net of liabilities outside the united states that are legally owned by abbott  but used by hospira in its business  are required to be completed over the two year transition period 
in connection with those transfers  hospira is obligated to pay abbott the net book value of such net assets at the time of transfer 
as of december   the net book value of the net assets remaining to be transferred was million 
pending the legal transfer to hospira  these operations and assets are being used in the conduct of hospira s international business and hospira is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by the operations and assets 
hospira and abbott entered into various manufacture and supply agreements prior to the spin off under which hospira sells certain products that it manufactured and supplied to abbott prior to the spin off 
these agreements have an initial two year term scheduled to expire in april and may be extended by abbott for an additional two year term under substantially similar contractual provisions 
some of these agreements will be terminated at the end of the initial two year period  and hospira expects its sales to abbott to decline substantially during hospira s transition activities involve risks and uncertainties  including the risk of incurring higher than estimated transition related and ongoing costs associated with operating independently  difficulties relating to implementing information technology systems and risks related to transitioning the international operations 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to hospira s transition from abbott and the spin off 
cost reduction activities as part of its strategy to improve margins and cash flows  hospira has taken a number of actions in an effort to reduce operating costs and optimize its manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
expenditures relating to these activities are not included in the transition activities discussed above 
in may  in order to reduce its costs to produce critical care products  hospira completed a strategic manufacturing  commercialization and development agreement with icu and sold its salt lake city manufacturing facility and related equipment and inventory to icu 
in connection with these transactions  during  hospira recorded an impairment charge of million and a loss of million  which is hospira s best estimate of the cost of certain obligations that hospira is required to reimburse to icu over a month period after closing 
both the impairment and the loss related to obligations assumed were recorded in cost of products sold 
for further details regarding the financial impact of these transactions  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in august  hospira announced plans to close its medical device manufacturing plant in donegal  ireland by mid products produced at the donegal plant are expected to move to hospira facilities primarily in costa rica and the dominican republic  which have available manufacturing capacity to absorb the transfers 
hospira expects to incur million to million of pre tax charges relating to the plant closure 
during  hospira incurred million of these charges  which is reported in cost of products sold 
the costs consist primarily of severance and other employee benefit costs  additional depreciation resulting from the decreased useful lives of the building and certain equipment  and other exit costs 
hospira expects to generate cost savings relating to this activity beginning in for further details regarding the financial impact of this plant closure  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in february  hospira announced plans to close its plants in ashland  ohio and montreal  canada over to months  respectively  and also provided a timeline for phasing out production at a facility in abbott laboratories north chicago  illinois campus  where it has leased space from its former parent company since the spin off in april hospira intends to transition out of this facility in advance of the lease s expiration in  with a majority of the product transfers occurring over the next four years 
hospira will transfer production of the primary products from these facilities to other hospira facilities and will outsource certain product components to third party suppliers 
the aggregate charges that hospira will incur related to the plant closings are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million on a pre tax basis  of which approximately million to million are expected to be reported as restructuring charges 
the restructuring costs consist primarily of costs related to severance and other employee benefit costs  additional depreciation resulting from the decreased useful lives of the buildings and certain equipment  and other exit costs 
the remaining charges relate to the relocation of production 
for further details regarding the financial impact of this plant closure  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item these cost reduction activities involve risks and uncertainties as relocating or outsourcing production is a complex process 
hospira may incur more charges than estimated and may not realize the expected cost savings on its planned time frame or at all 
see item a 
risk factors risks relating to hospira s business and industry hospira s cost reduction activities have resulted in significant charges 
these activities may disrupt hospira s business and may not result in the intended cost savings 
other factors manufacturing and quality 
hospira s ability to manufacture and sell high quality  low cost products in compliance with regulatory requirements is an important factor to the success of its business 
hospira must comply with detailed regulations governing the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of its products  including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  and must incur expense  time and effort to ensure compliance with the complex regulations 
hospira must also maintain continuity of supply of raw materials that comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
its business is subject to risks of manufacturing and supply interruptions  and product quality issues  which can lead to product recalls or field activities 
hospira did not experience significant manufacturing or raw material supply interruptions during however  in  hospira experienced higher raw material  freight and utilities costs as a result of rising oil and gas prices 
if hospira is unable to recover these higher costs through improved manufacturing performance or price increases  hospira s margins will be adversely affected 
hospira has recalled  and or conducted field alerts relating to  certain of its products from time to time 
while these activities can lead to costs to repair or replace affected products and temporary interruptions in product sales  and can impact reported results of operations in the applicable period  hospira does not believe that these activities had a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations during product development 
hospira views investment in research and development as an important driver of sales growth over the longer term 
new products and technologies were factors in driving higher gross profit during to successfully execute its product development strategy  hospira must continue to develop cost competitive products and enhancements that satisfy customer needs  introduce products on a timely basis and successfully market those products 
as a part of this strategy  hospira may also need to identify  and successfully manage  strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements 
during  hospira expects to generate sales growth  in part by launching new specialty injectable pharmaceutical products  representing seven new compounds  and by offering newer technology drug delivery pumps 
hospira s ability to execute this strategy is subject to various risks and uncertainties described in item a 
risk factors  including the ability to timely launch new products and enhancements  the ability to successfully manage collaborative arrangements  actions of competitors and acceptance by customers 
gpo contracts 
the ability to maintain gpo contracts is an important factor for hospira to generate sales 
approximately of hospira s net sales are made under these contracts 
typically  these contracts cover a portion of hospira s product lines  specify the prices for hospira s products  and are effective for three to five years 
generally  the contracts are extended or competitively bid prior to contract expiration 
hospira has four gpo pharmacy contracts to be renewed or renegotiated during if hospira is unable to renew or renegotiate any significant gpo contracts  its ability to sell products and its profitability may be harmed 
arrangements with drug wholesalers 
a significant portion of hospira s generic injectable pharmaceuticals are distributed to end user customers through drug wholesalers 
hospira believes that it has valid contractual relationships with all of its major drug wholesalers  and  in fact  renewed its relationship with one drug wholesaler at the end of in general  the drug wholesalers are attempting to increase their revenues by implementing a fee for service model for their distribution of pharmaceutical products that would increase fees higher than the levels specified in the existing contracts 
hospira denies that it owes any distribution fees in excess of those set forth in its contracts with the drug wholesalers 
one drug wholesaler continues to unilaterally invoice hospira for higher fees that it alleges are due for the distribution of hospira s generic injectable pharmaceutical products 
hospira has not recorded any provision for these invoices 
hospira believes that it has adequate arrangements in place to distribute its products and that this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its business or prospects 
share repurchase 
in february  hospira s board of directors approved a million share repurchase program 
hospira expects to fund any repurchases from operating cash flow 
the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on various factors  including alternative uses of cash  and business and market conditions 
the repurchase of shares commenced in early march berlex agreement 
during the first half  the agreement under which hospira distributed berlex imaging agents was terminated 
as a result  during  hospira s sales are expected to be negatively impacted by million  when compared to as the berlex agreement involved relatively low margin products  the absence of profits related to these sales is expected to improve gross margin in  when compared to stock option expenses 
beginning in  expenses relating to the issuance of employee stock options or other share based payments issued to hospira s employees will be reflected in hospira s results of operations 
the amount of expense will depend on the number of options or other share based awards granted in the future  the terms of those awards and their fair values 
for further information  see the information regarding the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  under recently issued accounting standards in this item critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
hospira believes its most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition hospira recognizes revenues from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for other than certain drug delivery pumps and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing  product revenue is recognized when products are delivered and title passes to customers 
placements of drug delivery pumps with customers typically fall under one of three types of arrangements outright sales of the drug delivery pump to the customer  placements under lease arrangements  and placements under contracts that include associated disposable set purchases 
for placements under lease agreements  certain arrangements for which hospira s warranty obligation extends through the entire lease term are accounted for as operating leases 
for these  hospira recognizes revenue over the lease term  which averages five years 
for leases under which hospira s warranty obligation is limited to approximately one year  hospira accounts for these as sales type leases  under which the discounted sales value of the drug delivery pump is recorded as revenue upon placement with the customer 
for contracts with multiple deliverables  total revenue is divided among the separate units of accounting deliverables based on their relative fair value and is recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition criteria 
in instances when fair value exists only for undelivered elements  the residual method is used to allocate total consideration 
injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing involves filling customers active pharmaceutical ingredients api into delivery systems 
under these arrangements  customers api is often consigned to hospira and revenue is recorded for the materials and labor provided by hospira  plus a profit  upon shipment to the customer 
in addition  hospira records sales of product rights as revenue upon disposition of the rights 
sales of product rights have not been significant 
a large part of hospira s sales are through wholesalers and to gpo member hospitals 
these sales typically include provisions for chargebacks  rebates and other adjustments which are provided for as a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded 
historical data is readily available and reliable  and is used for estimating the amounts of the reduction in gross sales 
the most significant provisions are chargebacks and rebates  which are described in the following paragraphs 
chargebacks and rebates the provision for chargebacks is a significant and complex estimate used to determine the recognition of revenue 
hospira sells products to end customers either directly or through wholesalers who then resell the products to end customers 
for products sold through wholesalers  hospira charges the wholesaler a predetermined price  known as wholesaler acquisition cost  which is typically higher than the amount contracted with the end customer 
wholesalers then sell to the end customer at the lower price based on contractual terms previously established between hospira and the end customer 
hospira records the initial sale to the wholesaler at wholesaler acquisition cost and at the same time  records a chargeback provision equal to the estimated amount the wholesaler will charge hospira for the difference between the wholesaler acquisition cost and the estimated average end customer contract price 
this process is necessary to enable hospira to track actual sales to the end customer  which is essential information to run the business effectively 
hospira estimates chargebacks based upon historical experience  current contract prices  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and claims processing lag time 
chargebacks are recorded as reductions to gross sales and trade receivables 
hospira regularly monitors the provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes the actual chargebacks may differ from estimates 
at december  and  chargebacks of million and million  respectively  are recorded as a reduction in trade receivables 
settlement of chargebacks generally occurs between and days after the sale to wholesalers 
hospira primarily offers contract rebates to customers who either purchase directly from hospira or from certain wholesalers who sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between hospira and the customer  or to government agencies  which administer various programs such as medicaid 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases 
factors used in the rebate calculations relate to the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using actual contract terms and eligible purchases  hospira estimates the amount of the rebate due at the time of sale  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when hospira records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
hospira regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
at december  and  accrued rebates of million and million  respectively  are included in other accrued liabilities 
the following table is an analysis of chargebacks and rebates for and dollars in thousands wholesaler chargebacks rebates balance at january    provisions   payments   balance at december  provisions payments   balance at december  a one percentage point discount in end customer contract prices as a percentage of sales would decrease net sales and income from operations by approximately million 
pension and post retirement benefits hospira provides pension and post retirement medical and dental benefits to certain of its employees based both in and outside of the united states 
prior to the spin off date  hospira employees participated in abbott benefit plans that provided pension and post retirement benefits 
for financial reporting purposes  hospira develops long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics  and reviews public market data and general economic information 
the discount rate is estimated using moody s aa corporate bond index  with consideration of differences in duration between the bonds in the index and hospira s benefit liabilities 
the expected rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future return of each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
hospira considers historical performance for the types of assets in which the plans invest  independent market forecasts  and economic and capital market conditions 
the healthcare cost trend rate for was  declining to by a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate  with other assumptions held constant  would increase decrease the service and interest component of net post retirement medical and dental cost for the year ended december  by approximately million  and would increase decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
in  hospira changed the actuarial valuation measurement date for certain of the pension and post retirement plans from december to november to facilitate the planning and reporting process 
the effect of this change did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
loss contingencies hospira accounts for contingent losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
accordingly  if hospira is initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
income taxes hospira s provision for income taxes is based on taxable income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which hospira operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
reserves are established when  despite hospira s belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority s determination of the positions 
such reserves are based on management s judgment  utilizing internal and external tax advisors  and represent the best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to reserves 
each quarter  hospira reviews the anticipated mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions and its reserves in accordance with sfas no 
deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid 
provision for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided for on undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries when hospira intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely to meet working capital and plant and equipment acquisition needs 
see further discussion regarding the impact on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act in note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the spin off date  the provision for income taxes was calculated on a separate return basis 
under the tax sharing agreement executed in conjunction with the spin off  abbott will indemnify hospira for tax liabilities arising for periods prior to the spin off date 
therefore  no tax liabilities for the periods prior to the spin off are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the separation and distribution agreement with abbott allows for a one time adjustment to distributed deferred taxes based on actual tax return filings by abbott which include hospira s results through the spin off date 
in addition  during  hospira performed an analysis of the appropriate state tax rate required based on hospira s tax position as a stand alone taxpayer for the net deferred tax assets transferred from abbott at the spin off date 
as a result  hospira has determined that its income taxes as a stand alone taxpayer should be provided at a higher effective rate than the rate used while part of abbott 
the final adjustment for these two items was made in  which resulted in a million increase to net deferred tax assets and additional paid in capital 
prior to hospira s separation from abbott in april  hospira had no income tax filing history as an independent company 
prospectively  hospira has been providing for income taxes based on its post separation independent activities 
these estimates might change in future periods as hospira develops its own tax filing history and considers the results of tax authority examinations

a comparison of product line sales is as follows percent change years ended december dollars in millions us specialty injectable pharmaceuticals medication delivery systems injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing sales to abbott laboratories other total us    international sales to third parties sales to abbott laboratories total international sales consolidated net sales percent change computed based on unrounded numbers compared to sales in specialty injectable pharmaceuticals declined  reflecting the termination of the berlex imaging agents distribution agreement and the impact of increased generic competition on hospira s corlopam product 
sales of the remainder of the specialty injectable pharmaceuticals product line were strong  driven by the impact of sales of products launched in and ceftriaxone  deferoxamine and fluconazole  increased volumes of syringe products  certain anti infectives which hospira believes was partially driven by a competitor s inability to supply product in the third and fourth quarters of  and which is not expected to have significant favorable impact beyond  and favorable price 
the sales increase in medication delivery systems was driven by growth in medication management systems  partially offset by a decline in infusion therapy products 
the growth in medication management systems was due to placements of hospira s newer technology plum a pumps with hospira mednet coupled with a higher mix of sales type leases and outright sales versus operating leases 
the decline in infusion therapy product sales was driven by the expiration of a contract under which hospira sold product to a competitor  as well as lower pricing on sets  partially offset by other favorable volume mix 
sales in injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing were flat primarily due to favorable price and growth in demand for several existing supply agreements offset by the impact of the termination of certain contracts 
the decrease in us sales to abbott was due to the exclusion of the cost of the bulk drug subsequent to the spin off for certain products manufactured for abbott  while through april included the cost of these bulk drugs 
this reflects the post spin off manufacturing arrangement between hospira and abbott  under which abbott transfers the bulk drug to hospira for processing and hospira s sales include only the value added portion plus a markup for these products 
this reduction was partially offset by increased demand by abbott for several of its products and by the markup on products sold to abbott after the spin off 
the increase in other us sales was primarily due to increased sales of products launched in and ceftriaxone and deferoxamine and certain anti infectives which hospira believes was partially driven by a competitor s inability to supply product in the third and fourth quarters of  and which is not expected to have significant favorable impact beyond to alternate site healthcare customers  partially offset by a decline in sales of critical care products 
hospira expects increased competition to negatively impact its deferoxamine sales in the future 
international sales to third parties increased primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rates 
international sales to abbott increased primarily due to volume related to an additional product manufactured for abbott subsequent to the spin off  coupled with the impact of the markup on products sold to abbott after the spin off  partially offset by reduced demand on other products 
compared to the sales increase in specialty injectable pharmaceuticals was primarily due to increased sales of generic anti infective products  new products fluconazole and deferoxamine  berlex imaging agents  and precedex  partially offset by a decline in corlopam due to generic competition 
the sales increase in medication delivery systems was driven by growth in both medication management systems and infusion therapy products 
the growth in medication management was due to increased placements of hospira s newer technology plum a  gemstar and lifecare pca pumps 
in addition  medication management sales in were favorably impacted by a change in the business model which resulted in some leases being accounted for as sales type leases compared to the previous business model under which most leases were accounted for as operating leases 
included in is an adjustment of million related to resulting from the reclassification of some leases from operating to sales type leases 
the increase in infusion therapy product sales was driven by higher volumes  partially offset by price 
the sales increase in injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing was primarily due to the impact of the sales ramp up related to supply agreements signed in  as well as growth in demand for several existing supply agreements 
the decrease in us sales to abbott was primarily due to the exclusion of the cost of the bulk drug subsequent to the spin off for certain products manufactured for abbott  while included the cost of these bulk drugs for the full year 
this reflects the post spin off manufacturing arrangement between hospira and abbott under which abbott transfers the bulk drug to hospira for processing and hospira s sales include only the value added portion  plus a markup for these products 
in addition  reduced demand by abbott for several of its products contributed to the decline in sales 
these reductions were partially offset by the markup on products sold to abbott after the spin off 
other us sales primarily include sales to alternate site providers  such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities  and sales of critical care products 
the decline in other us sales is primarily due to reflecting the gain on the sale of paclitaxel product rights as well as the related loss of paclitaxel sales resulting from the divestiture of the product rights  a volume decline in critical care products  and the wind down of the home infusion product line in  partially offset by increased sales to alternate site customers and sales being negatively impacted by a product recall 
international sales to third parties declined due to reduced emphasis on a low margin product and lower sales in critical care  partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates 
international sales to abbott increased in primarily due to volume related to an additional product manufactured for abbott subsequent to the spin off  coupled with the impact of the markup on products sold to abbott after the spin off 
gross profit percent change years ended december dollars in millions gross profit as a percent of sales compared to the increase in gross profit margin in was primarily the result of volume product mix improvement of  which includes the impact of berlex of  reduced benefit costs of as a result of the changes in certain post retirement benefit plans in  price of  and other changes of 
these increases were offset by charges of resulting from the asset impairment and obligations assumed related to the sale of the salt lake city manufacturing facility to icu and charges of resulting from the asset impairments related to the ashland  ohio and montreal  canada facilities and costs relating to the planned donegal  ireland plant shutdown

research and development percent change years ended december dollars in millions research and development expense as a percent of sales compared to the increase in research and development expenses in was primarily due to spending on new product development related to integrated software for drug delivery devices that help prevent medication errors  a next generation drug delivery device  new compounds added to hospira s generic injectable drug pipeline and spending for a phase iv safety study on hospira s branded sedative  precedex  as a condition of marketing the product 
these increases were partially offset by reduced benefit costs as a result of the changes in benefit plans in compared to the increase in research and development expenses in was due to spending associated with new product development primarily related to the development of a next generation drug delivery device  software systems and new compounds being added to hospira s generic injectable drug pipeline 
spending in also includes a phase iv safety study on hospira s branded sedative  precedex  as a condition of marketing the product 
these increases were partially offset by reduced employee benefit costs as a result of the changes in certain post retirement benefit plans and higher spending in related to external contracted services for specific compliance projects 
selling  general and administrative percent change years ended december dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to additional costs related to becoming a separate stand alone public company 
these costs include the establishment of corporate functions  information technology and costs relating to establishing hospira s business infrastructure outside the united states 
a substantial portion of the increase relates to costs associated with the implementation of sap as hospira s global enterprise resource planning erp system 
the increase in costs was partially offset by reduced employee benefit costs as a result of changes in benefit plans in hospira s selling  general and administrative expenses for reflect the first full year of ongoing  incremental expenses associated with being a separate stand alone company 
compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to additional costs related to becoming a separate stand alone public company

curtailment of post retirement medical and dental benefits in the second quarter of  hospira announced a series of benefit plan changes  which included the discontinuation of the us non union post retirement medical and dental plan 
the effect of the discontinuation of the post retirement medical and dental plan was a non cash pre tax benefit of million resulting from the reversal of the related liability 
interest expense prior to the spin off  hospira did not have any debt 
in connection with the spin off  hospira incurred million principal amount of debt  and  as a result  hospira incurred interest expense of million in and million in interest was primarily paid on the senior unsecured notes  which were issued to repay money borrowed under the senior unsecured credit facility that hospira entered into in connection with the spin off

the effective tax rates are less than the statutory us federal income tax rate principally due to the benefit of tax exemptions  of varying durations  in certain jurisdictions outside the united states 
taxes on income are determined on a separate return basis through april   at which time hospira became a separate stand alone taxpayer 
abbott has retained responsibility for all tax liabilities prior to the spin off date

these operations and assets are used in the conduct of hospira s international business and hospira is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by such operations and assets 
hospira is obligated to pay abbott for these operations and assets  and assume the corresponding liabilities  over a two year period after the spin off date as hospira establishes its business infrastructure outside the united states and obtains regulatory approval for the transfer of the marketing authorizations for hospira products to local hospira affiliates or third party distributors 
the amount payable is equal to the net book value of those assets and liabilities at the time of such transfer 
accordingly  the net book value will be affected by normal operations  exchange rates and other business factors 
hospira pays abbott interest  at local prevailing short term rates  in connection with hospira s use of certain of these assets during that period 
as of december   the net book value of the assets and liabilities that had not yet transferred was million

 inventory costs 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facilities expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period expenses 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
for hospira  this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred after december  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on hospira s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  which previously allowed the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options 
since hospira currently accounts for share based payments using the intrinsic value method  hospira s results of operations have not included the recognition of compensation expense 
had hospira applied the fair value criteria established in sfas no

legislative issues hospira s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation 
hospira expects debate to continue at both the federal and state levels over the availability  method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services 
if additional legislation is enacted  it could have the effect of reducing prices  or reducing the rate of price increases  for medical products and services 
international operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which hospira or the healthcare industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument and risk management hospira operates globally  and earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
upon consideration of management objectives  costs and opportunities  hospira uses derivative instruments  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to manage these risks 
hospira enters into derivative instrument contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure to nonperformance by any one institution 
hospira does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments hospira s operations are exposed to currency exchange rate risk  which is mitigated by hospira s use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
currency exposures include third party trade payables and receivables  and intercompany loans where the asset or liability is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity 
forward contract gains and losses on these exposures substantially offset the remeasurement of the hedged asset or liability 
in addition  currency exposures exist for certain subsidiaries for anticipated intercompany purchases  firm commitments  and third party forecasted transactions expected to be denominated in a foreign currency due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
forward contract gains and losses for these exposures are included in other income during the term of the forward contract  as they are not formally designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
net forward contract expense and the carrying value and fair value of forward contracts were not significant in and prior to the spin off date  hospira participated in abbott s management of these same foreign currency exposures 
in connection with the spin off  hospira and abbott agreed that the legal transfer of certain operations and assets net of liabilities outside the united states would occur  and be completed  within two years after the spin off 
these operations and assets are used in the conduct of hospira s international business and hospira is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by such operations and assets 
hospira is obligated to pay abbott for these operations and assets  and assume the corresponding liabilities  from abbott over a two year period after the spin off date as hospira establishes its business infrastructure outside the united states and obtains regulatory approval for the transfer of the marketing authorizations for hospira products to local hospira affiliates or third party distributors 
the amount payable is equal to the net book value of those assets and liabilities at the time of such transfer 
accordingly  the net book value is affected by normal operations  exchange rates and other business factors 
exchange rate gains and losses on the net asset exposures are substantially offset by the remeasurement of a portion of the due to abbott liability  both of which are denominated in the foreign currency of the applicable country 
upon transfer  the net assets will be maintained in the functional currency of the operating country whereby exchange rate changes affecting the net assets will be included as cumulative translation adjustments in equity 
hospira does not currently intend to hedge the net investment exposure 
interest rate sensitive financial instruments hospira s primary interest rate exposures relate to cash and cash equivalents  and fixed and variable rate debt 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
hospira s investment portfolio of million at december  consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity securities  which are classified as available for sale 
for equity securities  any gains or losses will not be recognized in hospira s statements of income until the investment is sold or if there is a reduction in fair value that is determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates fair market value at december  and the value at maturity  as the majority of investments consist of securities with maturities of less than three months 
because hospira s investments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates  based on average cash and cash equivalents during the year  would increase decrease interest income by approximately million 
in conjunction with the spin off from abbott  on june   hospira completed an underwritten offering of a consolidated million aggregate principal amount consisting of million five year senior unsecured notes and million ten year senior unsecured notes both of which bear a fixed rate of interest 
in addition  hospira s new credit facility  entered into on december   consists of a revolving credit facility of million revolver that is available for working capital and other requirements 
the revolver allows hospira to borrow funds at variable interest rates as short term cash needs dictate 
as of december   hospira had no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
hospira has entered into various loan agreements related to the legal transfer of certain international operations from abbott 
these borrowings are made by hospira s foreign affiliates in their local currency and are used to optimize the capital structure 
as of december   hospira had million of such loans outstanding 
in january  hospira entered into interest rate swap transactions whereby the million five year senior unsecured notes due in june were effectively converted from fixed to floating rate debt 
hospira records the interest rate swap contracts at fair value and offsets the carrying amount of the fixed rate debt by the same amount 
at december   these interest rate swaps had an aggregate fair market value of million 
if these derivative instruments had been terminated at december   this estimated fair value represents the amount that hospira would have to pay to counterparties 
as a result of converting from fixed to floating rate debt  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease interest expense by million
