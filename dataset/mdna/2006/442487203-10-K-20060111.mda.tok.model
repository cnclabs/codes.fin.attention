item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements business combinations when we make an acquisition of another company  we use the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas 
under sfas  we record as our cost the estimated fair value of the acquired assets less liabilities assumed 
any difference between the cost of an acquired company and the sum of the fair values of tangible and intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the reported income of an acquired company includes the operations of the acquired company from the date of acquisition 
income recognition from home and land sales income from home and land sales is recorded when title is conveyed to the home or land buyer  adequate cash payment has been received and there is no continued involvement 
additionally  in certain markets  we sell lots to customers  transferring title  collecting proceeds  and entering into contracts to build homes on these lots 
in these cases  we do not recognize the revenue from the lot sale until we deliver the completed home and have no continued involvement related to that home 
the cash received on the lot is recorded as customer deposits until the revenue is recognized 
income recognition from mortgage loans profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
interest income recognition for mortgage loans receivable and recognition of related deferred fees and costs interest income is recognized as earned for each mortgage loan during the period from the loan closing date to the sale date when legal control passes to the buyer and the sale price is collected 
all fees related to the origination of mortgage loans and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recorded as either a an adjustment to the related mortgage loans upon the closing of a loan or b recognized as a deferred asset or deferred revenue while the loan is in process 
these fees and costs include loan origination fees  loan discount  and salaries and wages hovnanian enterprises  inc 
for individuals that are directly related to loan origination 
such deferred fees and costs relating to the closed loans are recognized over the life of the loans as an adjustment of yield or taken into operations upon sale of the loan to a permanent investor 
inventories inventories and long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
for inventories of communities under development  a loss is recorded when events and circumstances indicate impairment and the undiscounted future cash flows generated are less than the related carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is based on discounted future cash flows generated from expected revenue  cost to complete including interest  and selling costs 
insurance deductible reserves for fiscal  our deductible was million per occurrence for general liability insurance and  per occurrence for worker s compensation insurance 
for fiscal  our deductible was  per occurrence for worker s compensation and general liability insurance 
reserves have been established based upon actuarial analysis of estimated future losses during and for fiscal  our deductible increases to million per occurrence with an aggregate million for bodily injury and property damage claims  and an aggregate million for product defect claims under our general liability insurance 
our worker s compensation insurance deductible increases to million per occurrence for interest costs related to properties under development are capitalized during the land development and home construction period and expensed as cost of sales interest as the related inventories are sold 
costs related to properties not under development are charged to interest expense separately in the consolidated statements of income 
land options costs are capitalized when incurred and either included as part of the purchase price when the land is acquired or charged to operations when we determine we will not exercise the option

the effects of lessee involvement in asset construction eitf  we record on the consolidated balance sheets specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and o ther options under consolidated inventory not owned with the offset to liabilities from inventory not owned  minority interest from inventory not owned and minority interest from consolidated joint ventures 
intangible assets the intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet are goodwill  tradenames  architectural designs  distribution processes  and contractual agreements with both definite and indefinite lives resulting from company acquisitions 
we no longer amortize goodwill or indefinite life intangibles  but instead assess them periodically for impairment 
we performed such assessments utilizing a fair value approach as of october  and  and determined that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite life intangibles existed 
we are amortizing the definite life intangibles over their expected useful life  ranging from three to eight years 
in may  we made a decision to change our fiscal california acquisition brand name to k 
hovnanian homes 
this resulted in a reclassification of million from goodwill and indefinite life intangibles to definite life intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet at that time 
we are amortizing the definite life intangible as the homes in the communities still using the old california acquisition brand name are delivered to customers and the revenue on the sale of these homes is recognized 
using this methodology  we expect this intangible to be substantially written off by our fourth quarter of post development completion costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
warranty costs based upon historical experience  we accrue warranty costs as part of cost of sales for essential repair costs over  to homes  community amenities and land development infrastructure 
in addition  we accrue for warranty costs under our million per occurrence general liability insurance deductible as part of selling  general and administrative costs 
as previously stated  the deductible for our general liability insurance will increase for hovnanian enterprises  inc 
fiscal to million per occurrence with an aggregate million for bodily injury and property damage claims  and an aggregate million for product defect claims 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in our northeast region new jersey  southern new york  pennsylvania  ohio  michigan  minnesota  and illinois  our southeast region washington dc  delaware  maryland  virginia  west virginia  north carolina  south carolina  and florida  our southwest region texas and arizona  and our west region california 
in addition  we provide financial services to our homebuilding customers 
our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  were for operating expenses  increases in housing inventories  construction  income taxes  interest  the pay down of our revolving credit facility  the repurchase of common stock  investment in joint ventures including town country homes  and acquisitions of cambridge homes  oster homes  and first home builders of florida 
we provided for our cash requirements from housing and land sales  the revolving credit facility  non recourse mortgage secured by operating property  the issuance of million senior notes  million senior subordinated notes  million net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  financial service revenues  and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and other needs 
cash requirements for fiscal are projected to increase as we continue to open new communities fund organic growth and acquire other homebuilders 
we anticipate issuing senior and or senior subordinated notes and moderate usage under the existing revolving credit facility to replenish inventory associated with the construction of new homes 
our net income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  accounts payable  inventory levels  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  amortization of computer software costs  amortization of definite life intangibles and impairment losses 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal and  inventory levels  acquisition costs  receivables  prepaids and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
liabilities also increase as operations expand 
the increase in liabilities partially offsets the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  receivables  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increase  but for cash flow purposes are offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october   million shares have been purchased under this program  of which million and million shares were repurchased during the twelve months ended october  and  respectively 
in addition  in  we retired at no cost million shares that were held by a seller of a previous acquisition 
on march   our board of directors authorized a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
all share information reflects this stock dividend 
on july   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
dividends on the series a preferred stock are not cumulative and will be paid at an annual rate of 
the series a preferred stock is not convertible into the company s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares beginning on the fifth anniversary of their issuance 
the series a preferred stock is traded as depositary shares  with each depositary share representing th of a share of series a preferred stock 
the depositary shares are listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol hovnp 
the net proceeds from the offering of million  reflected in paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet  were used for the partial repayment of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility as of july  o n october   we paid million as dividends on the series a preferred stock 
our homebuilding bank borrowings are made pursuant to an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement the agreement that provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of billion through july the facility contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased to billion subject to the availability of additional commitments 
interest is payable monthly at various rates based on a margin ranging from to per annum  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement plus  at the company s option  either a base rate determined by reference to the higher of a pnc bank  national association s prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus or a libor based rate for a one  two  three or six month interest period as selected by us 
in addition  we pay a fee ranging from to per annum on the unused portion of hovnanian enterprises  inc 
the revolving credit line depending on our consolidated leverage ratio and the average percentage unused portion of the revolving credit line 
at october   there was zero drawn under this agreement and we had approximately million of homebuilding cash 
at october   we had issued million of letters of credit which reduces cash available under the agreement 
we believe that we will be able either to extend the agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
we currently are in compliance and intend to maintain compliance with the covenants under the agreement 
we and each of our significant subsidiaries  except for various subsidiaries formerly engaged in the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations  a subsidiary formerly engaged in homebuilding activity in poland  our financial services subsidiaries  joint v entures  and certain other subsidiaries  is a guarantor under the agreement 
at october   we had  million of outstanding senior debt  million  net of discount  comprised of million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million of senior notes due  and million of senior notes due at october   we had out standing million of senior subordinated debt comprised of million senior subordinated notes due  million senior subordinated notes due  and million of senior subordinated notes due we and each of our wholly owned subsidiaries  except for k 
hovnanian enterprises  inc  the issuer of the senior and senior subordinated notes  and various subsidiaries f ormerly engaged in the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations  a subsidiary formerly engaged in homebuilding activity in poland  our financial services subsidiaries  and joint ventures  is a guarantor of the senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
on may   we redeemed our senior notes due  and we recorded million of expenses associated with the extinguishment of this debt 
on march   we paid off our million term loan  and we recorded million of expenses associated with the extinguishment of the debt 
in both cases  these expenses have been reported as expenses related to extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of income 
our mortgage banking subsidiary s warehousing agreement was amended on april  pursuant to the agreement  we may borrow up to million 
the agreement expires in april and interest is payable monthly at the eurodollar rate plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend this agreement beyond april or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
we also have a million commercial paper facility 
the facility expires in september and interest of libor plus 
is payable monthly 
as of october   the aggregate principal amount of all borrowings under both agreements was million 
total inventory increased million during the twelve months ended october  this increase excluded the change in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with sfas  sfas  and eitf  and variable interest entities in accordance with fin see the recent accounting pronouncements section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional explanation of fin excluding the impact from acquisitions of million in our northeast region and southeast region  total inventory in our northeast region increased million  the southeast region increased million  the southwest region increased million  and our west region decreased million 
the increase in our existin g regions was primarily the result of planned future organic growth 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next eighteen months 
most inventory completed or under development is financed through our line of credit  and senior and senior subordinated indebtedness 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we limit our financial exposure to the amounts invested in the option deposits and predevelopment costs 
this significantly reduces our risk and generally allows us to obtain necessary development approvals before acquisition of the land

prepaid expenses and other assets are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid project costs    senior residential rental properties   other prepaids    other assets    total    prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
the increase in prepaid hovnanian enterprises  inc 
project costs was primarily due to the opening of new communities in all our regions 
other prepaids and other assets are debt issuance fees  non qualified associate benefit plan assets  and miscellaneous prepaids and assets  which have increased because of the issuance of our senior and senior subordinated debt  higher contributions to a deferred compensation plan  higher prepaid commissions as a result of business growth  and acquisitions of cambridge homes  oster homes  and first home builders of florida 
property  plant  and equipment increased million to million at october  the increase relates principally to the acquisition of first home builders of florida  which has its own construction services business with equipment and plant space  as well as the new corporate office building being constructed in red bank  new jersey 
investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures increased as we entered into five new homebuilding joint ventures during the twelve months ended october  as of october   we have investments in nine homebuilding joint ventures and nine land and land development joint ventures 
other than performance and completion guarantees and environmental indemnifications  no other guarantees associated with unconsolidated joint ventures have been given 
definite life intangibles increased million to million at october  this increase was the result of our acquisitions of cambridge homes  oster homes  and first home builders of florida offset by the intangible amortization for the year 
to the extent the acquisition price was greater than the book value of tangible assets which were stepped up to fair values  purchase price premiums were classified as intangibles 
professionals are hired to appraise all acquired intangibles 
the appraisals have not been completed yet for oster homes and first home builders of florida acquisitions 
the appraisals that have been completed for fiscal and acquisitions resulted in all premiums being categorized as definite life intangibles 
see the critical accounting policies section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional explanation of intangibles 
for tax purposes all our intangibles  except those resulting from an acquisition classified as a tax free exchange  are being amortized over years 
mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential mortgages receivable of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  were being temporarily warehoused and awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the slight increase in mortgage loans held for sale  while total volume increased significantly  was due to the shortening in the average amount of time between the loan closing and the sale of the mortgage 
we may incur risk with respect to mortgages that become delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable    reserves    accrued expenses    accrued compensation    other liabilities    total    the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due to our acquisitions during  as well as the opening of new communities in our existing markets

we sell a variety of home types in various communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of both the communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
the consolidated gross margins  before interest expense increased to during the year ended october  compared to for the same period last year due primarily to the mix of homes delivered both in terms of geography as well as type of home 
generally speaking homes in highly regulated markets in the northeast  southeast and west have higher margins than homes in less regulated markets 
during the year ended october   our consolidated gross margin  before interest expense  remained flat from the previous year despite the fact that we believe gross margins were adversely impacted in due to the effect of price increases in lumber  concrete  and certain other building mat erials 
the dollar increases in homebuilding gross margin  before interest expense for each of the three years ended october    and were attributed to increased sales  resulting from both organic growth in deliveries and our acquisitions of other homebuilders 
also shown in the table are our results of gross margins  after interest expense 
after deducting interest expense  which was previously capitalized and amortized through cost of sales  our homebuilding gross margin was for compared to for and  but as a percentage of revenue cost of sales interest has remained flat at for the years ended october    and homebuilding selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased basis points to for the year ended october  such expenses increased to million for the year ended october   and increased to million for the year ended october  from million for the previous year 
the increased spending year over year was primarily due to our acquisitions and overhead costs for organically expanding operations ahead of our expected future growth in housing revenues 
we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling   and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these write offs and write downs were incurred primarily because of the decision not to exercise certain options to purchase land  redesign of communities in planning  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property or lower property values 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to   and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned  abandoned engineering costs are written off 
option and approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s proforma profitability does not produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all our regions 
during the year ended october   we wrote down a community million in our northeast region  million in our southeast region  and million in our southwest region 
the write down in the northeast region was attributed to a section of a community that was built in accordance with a low income housing clause 
in preparation for selling this property  an outside appraisal was prepared resulting in a reduction in inventory carrying amount to fair value 
the write downs in our southeast region and southwest region were attributed to property that was acquired as part of our acquisitions in these regions 
a decision was made to liquidate these two properties resulting in lower sales prices 
we wrote down one community million in our southwest region during the year ended october  this property was acquired as part of one of our acquisitions 
a decision was made to liquidate this property resulting in lower sales prices 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended in thousands october  october  october  land and lot sales    cost of sales  excluding interest    land and lot sales gross margin  excluding interest   land sales interest expense  land and lot sales gross margin  including interest   net pretax profits from land sales were million during fiscal although the amount of land sale profits varies from year to year  some land sale profits are typically recognized by hovnanian enterprises  inc 
the company each year in the normal course of homebuilding and land development operations  wherein certain parcels are sold to other builders  land developers  and commercial property developers 
land and lot sales are often the result of acquiring large parcels for which we do not want to do all the development 
in addition  this may happen more often in the future as hlig continues to acquire large parcels  with the intent to sell portions to other builders 
financial services financial services consists primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
during the years ended october   october   and october   financial services provided a   and million pretax profit  respectively 
in financial services revenue increased million to million  but this increase was more than offset by increased costs as the mortgage operations added overhead costs to prepare for future growth and the profit per loan declined as the mortgage market became more competitive with less mortgage refinancing occurring in versus the increase in was primarily due to increased activity in our mortgage operations  along with our homebuilding growth 
in addition to our wholly owned mortgage subsidiaries  customers obtained mortgages from our mortgage joint ventures in our nor theast region ohio and west region in and  and also our southeast region in in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold as the loans are closed 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
such expenses include our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were for the year ended october   for the year ended october   and for the year ended october  the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during the year ended october  compared to the same period last year was due to increased depreciation expense for new software systems  increased consulting services related to the new software implementation and sarbanes oxley compliance costs  and increased comp ensation with more headcount and higher profit based bonuses 
other interest other interest declined million to million for the year ended october  in other interest increased million to million for the year ended october  the fluctuation in other interest from year to year is a result of the relationship of total inventory and interest incurred in each year  because we capitalize interest related to inventory and the remainder is expensed 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior residential property operations  earnout payments from homebuilding company acquisitions  amortization of the consultant s agreement and the right of first refusal agreement from our california acquisition in fiscal  minority interest relating to consolidated joint ventures  corporate owned life insurance  and certain contributions 
off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million in option deposits in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of billion 
our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
however  million of the billion in land and lot option purchase contracts contained specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots upon satisfaction of certain requirements by both the sellers and the company 
therefore  this specific performance obligation of million is recorded on the balance sheet in liabilities from inventory not owned 
pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  we consolidated million of inventory not owned at october   hovnanian enterprises  inc 
representing the fair value of the optioned property 
additionally  to reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under fin  we eliminated million of its related cash deposits for lot option contracts  which are included in consolidated inventory not owned 
since we do not own an equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin  we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners 
when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been based on the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing 
in these cases  it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only as set recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity 
at october   the balance reported in minority interest from inventory not owned was million 
at october   we had cash deposits and letters of credit totaling million  representing our current maximum exposure associated with the consolidation of lot option contracts 
creditors of these vie s  if any  have no recourse against us 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt     capital lease obligations operating leases     purchase obligations    other long term liabilities total     represents our senior and senior subordinated notes and other notes payable  and related interest payments for the life of the debt 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of october  represents obligations under option contracts with specific performance provisions  net of cash deposits 
we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october  related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb and sfas this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in an entity s financial statements 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under statement will apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of the retrospective application under which financial statem ents for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement as a result  beginning in our fiscal first quarter of  we will adopt sfas r and begin reflecting the stock option expense determined under fair value based methods in our income statement rather than as pro forma disclosure in the notes to the financial statements

inflation inflation has a long term effect on us because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which our homes sell  we have not found this risk to be a significant problem

these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months
