overview collagenex pharmaceuticals  inc and subsidiaries is a specialty pharmaceutical company currently focused on developing and marketing innovative proprietary medical therapies to the dermatology market 
we currently market three prescription pharmaceutical products to the dermatology market through our professional dermatology sales force 
our strategy is to become a leading developer and marketer of innovative prescription pharmaceutical products to the dermatology market 
we intend to continue to market our current products and develop and launch new products based on our proprietary platform technologies as well as other technologies 
our lead development candidates are oracea  for which a new drug application  or nda  is currently under review by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of rosacea  incyclinide formerly known as col  which is currently in phase ii dose finding clinical trials for the treatment of acne  col  a pre clinical topical compound based upon the sansrosa technology that we are developing for the treatment of erythema skin redness associated with dermatological conditions  and our restoraderm dermal drug delivery system  which is currently under development 
our marketed dermatology products are pandel  a prescription corticosteroid we licensed from altana  inc in may  alcortin  a prescription topical antifungal steroid combination  and novacort  a prescription topical steroid and anesthetic 
in june  we executed a promotion and cooperation agreement with primus pharmaceuticals inc  or primus  to market alcortin and novacort to dermatologists 
we launched periostat in january  and by  periostat was the largest branded prescription pharmaceutical product in the dental market 
between april and june  we also sold a separately branded version of periostat to united research laboratories  inc mutual pharmaceutical company  inc  or mutual  pursuant to a license and supply agreement executed in april as part of a settlement of our outstanding patent litigation with mutual 
on may   we terminated our dental sales force and promotion activities for periostat following the introduction of a third party generic version of the product  and as a result of this generic launch  mutual ceased purchasing product from us in june we also discontinued the promotion of our other dental products on may  we continue to generate sales from periostat and other dental products  which all treat periodontal disease and include atridox  atrisorb freeflow and atrisorb d  or the atrix products  which are licensed from atrix laboratories  inc now known as qlt usa  inc in addition to our marketed products  we have a pipeline of product candidates in clinical and preclinical development 
these products are based on our proprietary platform technologies  impacs  sansrosa and restoraderm 
impacs inhibitors of multiple proteases and cytokines are a group of compounds that demonstrate a range of anti inflammatory activities as well as the ability to inhibit the breakdown of connective tissue 
periostat is our first fda approved impacs product 
oracea and incyclinide are impacs compounds currently in clinical development for the treatment of rosacea and acne  respectively 
our impacs technology is licensed on a perpetual basis from the research foundation of the state university of new york at stony brook  or suny 
our sansrosa technology was acquired in connection with our acquisition of sansrosa  and is an early stage project to develop a topical treatment col for the redness associated with rosacea 
our restoraderm technology is a proprietary  foam based  topical drug delivery technology that originated from a swedish collaborator 
we have acquired all rights  title and interest to the restoraderm technology 
we have formulated several potential products incorporating the restoraderm technology with active ingredients commonly used to treat dermatological conditions  although we have not yet developed timetables for the initiation of clinical development or the commercial launch of any of these products 
we recently completed two phase iii clinical trials for our leading impacs product candidate  oracea  for the treatment of rosacea  a dermatological condition 
oracea is a modified release form of a sub anti microbial dose of doxycycline  the same active ingredient as periostat 
we submitted our nda for oracea to the fda on august  on october   we announced that the nda for oracea had been accepted for review by the fda 
the prescription drug user fee act pdufa target date for reviewing the submission is may  in april  we announced the completion of a phase ii proof of concept clinical trial for our second generation impacs compound  incyclinide for the treatment of rosacea 
in september  we initiated a patient  double blinded  placebo controlled  phase ii dose finding clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of incyclinide for the treatment of acne 
on november   we announced that the national institutes of health had awarded a grant of approximately  for additional research into the potent anti inflammatory effects of incyclinide 
on december   we entered into definitive agreements with institutional and other investors to sell million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the first closing of this transaction  for million of the gross proceeds  was held on december  the second closing of this transaction  for million of the gross proceeds  occurred on january  the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million after deducting the placement agency fees and all offering expenses that were payable by us 
roth capital partners  llc acted as placement agent and suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets acted as financial advisor to us in connection with the offering 
we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of our common stock in we recorded our first profit in the third quarter of although we achieved net income of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  we incurred losses in every other year since inception and have an accumulated deficit of million at december  results of operations years ended december  and december  revenues revenues change dollars in thousands net product sales contract revenues license revenues total revenues during the year ended december  included approximately million in net product sales of periostat  mutual s branded version of periostat  pandel and the atrix products 
during  we recorded million in sales to mutual 
the decrease in net product sales was primarily due to lower periostat net sales as a result of the launch of a third party generic competitor in may based on data provided by a leading independent prescription tracking service  we estimate that periostat s share of the doxycycline market was at december  contract revenues during the year ended december  were derived primarily from our promotion and cooperation agreement with primus and residual contract revenues from our expired agreement with merck co  inc  or merck  for vioxx 
licensing revenues during the year ended december  consisted primarily of international licensing revenues for periostat and  in license revenue representing the unamortized portion of upfront license revenue received in from the license and supply agreement with showa yakuhin kako co  ltd  which was terminated in march during the year ended december   contract revenues were primarily derived from residual contract revenues from our expired agreement with merck and license revenues consisted primarily of international license fees for periostat  including the amortization of the showa yakuhin kako co  ltd

cost of product sales for the year ended december  includes a charge of approximately million associated with the estimated excess inventories of periostat and mutual s branded version of periostat as a result of the launch by a third party generic competitor 
cost of product sales also increased as a percentage of net product sales as a result of lower average selling prices to mutual  a greater absorption of fixed overhead expense over a smaller net sales base and a change in product mix during the year ended december  as compared the year ended december  research and development research and development change dollars in thousands research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of funds paid to third parties for the provision of services and materials for drug development  including milestone fees  manufacturing and formulation enhancements  clinical trials  purchased in process research and development  statistical analysis and report writing and regulatory compliance costs including a drug approval submission and filing fees

personnel and direct internal overhead expenses  including consulting and regulatory costs incurred during the year ended december   were approximately million 
we estimate that if oracea and incyclinide are developed to the point of commercialization  the additional formulation and clinical development expenses and milestone fees expected to be incurred over the next five years would be approximately to million 
we have discontinued all development work on periostat mr following the launch of generic competition to periostat in may and our decision to exit the dental business 
while we are currently conducting some formulation and stability work on products incorporating our restoraderm technology  we have not developed a timetable for clinical development or commercial launch 
accordingly  it is premature to estimate other future costs associated with the restoraderm technology 
it is also premature to estimate future development and clinical costs associated with the sansrosa technology 
significant development projects conducted during the year ended december  included clinical and manufacturing development work for oracea which accounted for total costs of approximately million  clinical and manufacturing development and formulation work for periostat mr  which accounted for total costs of approximately million  in process research and development charges associated with developing our restoraderm technology  including milestone fees and formulation and stability testing costs for two potential products  which accounted for total costs of approximately  the completion of a phase iii clinical trial to evaluate periostat for the treatment of rosacea  which accounted for  in expense  and clinical and manufacturing development work for incyclinide was personnel and direct internal overhead expenses  including consulting and regulatory costs incurred during the year ended december  were approximately million

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements pertain to revenue recognition  stock compensation and the valuation of deferred taxes  acquired product rights and inventory 
revenue recognition except for periostat and mutual sales beginning in the second quarter of  we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment to wholesale customers  net of estimated future returns  estimates for chargebacks  wholesale distribution fees  if applicable  rebates  generic introductions and current inventory levels in the distribution channel provided that collection was probable and no significant obligations remained 
following the launch of generic competition to periostat  and commencing with the second quarter of  we now recognize periostat sales revenue primarily based on sales to end users  which we estimate using prescription demand data generated by a leading independent prescription tracking service  as well as on hand inventory estimates in the distribution channel 
accordingly  since the launch of generic competition to periostat may increase the rate of product returns from the distribution channel  we have accrued million for potential product returns in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet at december  upon the launch of the third party generic equivalent to periostat  our agreement with mutual provides for rebates to be paid to mutual to compensate mutual and its customers for price erosion on the value of certain of its inventories of mutual s branded version of periostat 
accordingly  we have deferred revenues associated with our shipments of these products until such future time as the selling price becomes fixed and determinable 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet included  in deferred revenue associated with sales of mutual s branded version of periostat 
pursuant to our promotion and cooperation agreement with primus contract revenues for alcortin and novacort are fee based arrangements where revenue is earned as prescriptions are filled and recognized as a percentage of the gross profit earned by primus 
we do not take title to the inventory sold by primus under the promotion agreement 
stock based compensation it is our policy to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations to account for our stock option grants rather than statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on fixed stock option grants only if the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
had we applied sfas no 
 which requires recording stock option grants at their fair value  our net loss income would have varied from the reported net loss income as we would have recorded additional expenses in each period 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effect of applying sfas no 
to our results of operations and earnings per share allocable to common stockholders 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider the likelihood that part or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires significant judgment and estimates 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider our history of losses  scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and projected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset items are deductible 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
while we were profitable for the years ended december  and  we have incurred a net loss for the year ended december  and uncertainty regarding our future profitability has prevented us from reaching the more likely than not conclusion required under the applicable literature to recognize deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
acquired product rights product rights are stated at cost  amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the products or the contract term which such rights have been licensed  using the straight line method 
amortization of product rights is charged to cost of product sales 
we are required to test for asset impairment of acquired product rights whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset was impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in making future cash flow analyses of our acquired product rights  we make assumptions relating to i the intended use of the product rights and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use  ii generic competitor activities and regulatory initiatives that affect our products  and iii customer preferences and expected managed care reimbursement 
as a result of a change in the contractual life of the licensing and marketing agreement with atrix  we adjusted the current and future amortization of its acquired product rights asset to reflect a useful life through december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
inventories critical accounting estimates and assumptions  related to inventory carrying values are evaluated periodically and consider the saleable quantities of inventory versus quantities of inventory on hand 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million for the estimated excess inventory of periostat and mutual s branded version of periostat due to decreased demand following the introduction of a third party generic version of periostat 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
share based payments include grants of employee stock options and liabilities that are based on the fair value of our equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no
