item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview allos therapeutics  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for improving cancer treatments 
small molecule drugs  in general  are non protein products produced by chemical synthesis rather than biological methods 
we strive to develop drugs that improve the treatment of cancer and enhance the power of current therapies 
our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize  either alone or together with one or more potential strategic partners 
our focus is on product opportunities that leverage our internal clinical development and regulatory expertise and address important medical markets 
we have three product candidates that are currently under development  efaproxyn efaproxiral  pdx pralatrexate and rh we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and clinical development 
we have never generated any revenue from product sales and have experienced significant net losses since our inception in for the years ended december   and  we had net losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   we have accumulated a deficit of million during our development stage 
we expect to continue incurring net losses for the foreseeable future 
the presence and size of these potential net losses will depend  in large part  on if and when we receive regulatory approval in the united states or europe to market efaproxyn as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer 
our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability  alone or with partners  to successfully complete the development of our product candidates  conduct clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  and manufacture and market our product candidates 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the end of  except that additional capital resources will be required to support commercialization of efaproxyn in the event we obtain regulatory approval to market efaproxyn for the treatment of patients with brain metastases originating from breast cancer 
recent event in january  michael e 
hart notified our board of directors of his intent to resign his positions as president  chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company once a successor chief executive officer is appointed 
our board of directors has retained a nationally recognized executive search firm to assist in the recruitment of a successor chief executive officer 
however  competition for executive personnel is intense  and we may be unable to obtain a suitable replacement for mr 
hart in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  mr 
hart may choose to leave us prior to his successor being appointed 
if we are unable to find a suitable successor or successors to mr 
hart as the company s president  chief executive officer and chief financial officer in a timely manner  or mr 
hart chooses to leave us prior to his successor being appointed  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
on march   we entered into a separation agreement with mr 
hart to provide certain incentives for his continued employment with the company while we conduct our search for his successor 
pursuant to the separation agreement  if mr 
hart continues to serve as our president  chief executive officer and chief financial officer until his successor is appointed  he will be entitled to continuation of his annual base salary of  for a period of eighteen months following his termination of employment  a pro rata portion of his bonus  as determined in the sole discretion of our compensation committee of the board  continued vesting of his stock options granted prior to march  for a period of one year following his termination of employment  which options will remain exercisable until the later of i the date that is ninety days following mr 
hart s resignation from the board  or ii the date which is ninety days following the termination of his consulting relationship with the company as discussed below  reimbursement  on a grossed up basis  for the after tax payments of the premiums on his supplemental disability and term life insurance coverage for a period of twenty four months following his termination of employment  and reimbursement for the cost of his cobra continuation coverage until the earlier of i eighteen months from his termination of employment  or i the date on which he becomes eligible to receive comparable health insurance coverage from a new employer 
if our board of directors determines at any time that mr 
hart is not satisfactorily performing his duties  they may request mr 
hart s resignation  in which case he will not be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of his bonus or continued vesting of his options granted prior to march  if mr 
hart voluntarily terminates his employment before his successor is appointed  his salary continuation and cobra continuation benefits will be reduced from eighteen to twelve months  and he will not be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of his bonus or continued vesting of his options granted prior to march  in both scenarios  mr 
hart s options granted prior to march  will remain exercisable according to their terms  which generally means that mr 
hart may exercise the vested portion of such options within ninety days following the termination of his employment 
also pursuant to the separation agreement  on march   we granted mr 
hart a stock option to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share 
this option will become fully vested if mr 
hart remains employed in his current capacity until his successor is appointed and will remain exercisable until the later of i the date that is ninety days following mr 
hart s resignation from the board  or ii the date which is ninety days following the termination of his consulting relationship with the company 
if mr 
hart s employment is terminated for any reason before his successor is appointed  this option will be forfeited immediately upon his termination of employment 
finally  if mr 
hart remains employed until his successor is appointed  he will continue to serve as member of our board of directors  but has agreed to resign his position as a director upon the request of a majority of the non executive members of the board 
if mr 
hart is requested to resign his position as a director prior to december   the parties have agreed that mr 
hart will provide us with up to hours of consulting services per month from the date of his resignation as a director through december  results of operations comparison of years ended december   and research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs of certain personnel  basic research  nonclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory affairs  biostatistical data analysis  patents and licensing fees for new products 
years ended december  in millions research and development expenses the million decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the following million decrease in clinical trials costs resulting from close out costs recorded in in connection with the termination of a phase trial of efaproxyn in patients with nsclc as a expense reduction measure  million decrease in personnel costs resulting from headcount reductions implemented in  and million decrease resulting from an impairment charge recorded in in connection with our investment in n gene research laboratories  inc these decreases were partially offset by the following increases million increase in clinical trial costs resulting from increased patient enrollment in our phase enrich trial  million increase in licensing fees relating to a milestone payment paid in under our license agreement for pdx  and  increase in regulatory fees resulting from our maa filing in the million increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a million increase in clinical trial costs resulting from increased patient enrollment in our phase enrich trial 
this increase was partially offset by the following decreases million decrease in licensing fees resulting from a milestone payment paid in under our license agreement for pdx   decrease in nonclinical studies costs for pdx   decrease in consulting costs due to the cost of activities relating to our meeting with odac in may   decrease in regulatory fees due to the cost of our maa filing in  and  decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in due to the following an increase in costs relating to our phase single agent study of pdx in patients with nhl and our planned phase study of pdx in patients with relapsed or refractory ptcl  an increase in nonclinical studies costs resulting from new pdx studies starting in  a milestone payment of  due in december under our license agreement for pdx  and an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of accounting rules related to stock based compensation on january  we charge direct internal and external research and development expenses to the respective development programs 
since our inception through december   we have incurred direct costs of approximately million  million and  associated with research and development expenses for efaproxyn  pdx and rh respectively  and approximately million associated with our other research and development programs  including programs that have been discontinued 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs 
these consist primarily of salaries and benefits  facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
unallocated costs since inception through december  represent approximately million of research and development expenses 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and and for the cumulative period from our inception through december  cumulative period from september  through december  years ended december  in millions efaproxyn pdx rh other programs unallocated total research and development expenses the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our product candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
for a more complete discussion of the regulatory approval process  please refer to the government regulation section of item i above 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely and are impacted by a variety of factors discussed in the risk factors section of item ia above 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate costs of such efforts 
due to these same factors  we cannot be certain when  or if  any net cash inflow from any of our current product candidates will commence 
clinical manufacturing 
clinical manufacturing expenses include the costs of certain personnel  third party manufacturing costs for efaproxyn for use in clinical trials  costs associated with pre commercial scale up of manufacturing to support anticipated commercial requirements  and development activities for clinical trial and nonclinical studies material for pdx 
years ended december  in millions clinical manufacturing expenses the million decrease in clinical manufacturing expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the following million termination fee paid in in connection with the cancellation of our purchase orders for efaproxyn bulk drug substance that had been placed in anticipation of commercialization   decrease in third party manufacturing costs for efaproxyn  pdx and bgp  a compound for which the company discontinued development in   decrease in personnel costs due to headcount reductions implemented in  and  decrease in consulting costs 
the million decrease in clinical manufacturing expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the following  decrease in third party manufacturing costs for efaproxyn bulk drug substance and formulated drug product as our supplies during were sufficient for our clinical trials requirements in   decrease in third party manufacturing costs for pdx bulk drug substance and formulated drug product as our supplies during were sufficient for our clinical trials requirements in  and  decrease in personnel costs due to reduced headcount 
we currently have a sufficient supply of efaproxyn bulk drug substance and formulated drug product to support our clinical trial requirements for however  we expect our manufacturing expenses for efaproxyn to increase in as compared to as a result of costs incurred in connection with pre commercial scale up of manufacturing to support anticipated commercial requirements 
we also plan to increase our supply of pdx bulk drug substance and formulated drug product to support our requirements for pdx clinical trials and nonclinical studies in given the above  we expect total clinical manufacturing expenses in will increase as compared to marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include costs for pre marketing activities  executive administration  corporate offices and related infrastructure  and corporate development 
years ended december  in millions marketing  general and administrative expenses the  decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the following  decrease resulting from fees and expenses incurred in connection with a settlement of claims with n gene research laboratories  inc  and  decrease in marketing expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase resulting from expenses incurred in relating to our compliance efforts with the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
the  decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the following  decrease in third party legal fees relating to general corporate matters and the purported securities class action lawsuit filed in may   decrease in public relations costs resulting from reduced use of third party agencies   decrease in expenses relating to our second year of compliance efforts with the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations   decrease in facilities costs primarily resulting from the january sublease of excess space in our corporate offices and the corresponding restructuring costs recorded for this excess space  and  decrease in depreciation and amortization expense relating to our property and equipment 
these decreases were partially offset by the following increases  increase in non cash stock based compensation expense  primarily resulting from  of non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from the may amendment of certain options granted to our chairman of the board of directors in  and  increase in personnel costs primarily resulting from additional headcount 
we expect marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase in due to the following an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of accounting rules related to stock based compensation on january   an increase in marketing costs resulting from pre commercial activities for efaproxyn  and an increase in personnel costs  primarily resulting from additional headcount 
restructuring costs 
we recorded  and  in restructuring costs during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the restructuring costs for included severance and other employee termination costs of approximately  and legal fees of  the restructuring costs for of  represent a charge equal to our obligation on excess space in our corporate offices less the sum of the actual and expected sublease rental payments for this excess space 
as of december  and  there was no remaining liability related to the restructuring in as of december   the remaining liability related to the restructuring costs in was  gain on settlement claims 
in  we recognized a gain on settlement claims of approximately million in connection with our receipt of a one time settlement fee from durus life sciences master fund  ltd 
relating to short swing trading liabilities under section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
interest and other income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  for  and was   and million  respectively 
the  decrease in as compared to primarily resulted from lower average investment balances and lower yields on united states government securities  high grade commercial paper and corporate notes  and money market funds 
the million increase in as compared to primarily resulted from higher average investment balances and higher yields on united states government securities  high grade commercial paper and corporate notes  and money market funds 
income taxes 
as of december   we have approximately million of net operating loss nol carryforwards  approximately million of research and development r d credit carryforwards and a  orphan drug credit carryforward 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the utilization of these carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these carryforwards 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  contains provisions that may limit the nol  r d credit  and orphan drug credit carryforwards available for use in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service 
a greater than change in ownership of a company within a three year period results in an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards from tax periods prior to the ownership change 
our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards as of december  will likely be subject to annual limitation due to changes in ownership from previous financings 
the amount of these limitations  if any  is unknown  and our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards may expire unused 
additionally  future ownership changes could further limit the utilization of our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in marketable securities amounted to million at december  since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the private sale of securities and our initial public offering of common stock in march  which have resulted in net proceeds to us of million through december  we have also generated million of net interest income since our inception from investing the net proceeds of these financings 
we have used million of cash for operating activities from our inception through december  net cash used to fund our operating activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities for and was million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the maturities of investments in marketable securities  partially offset by the purchase of investments in marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities for was million  and consisted primarily of purchases of investments in marketable securities  partially offset by the proceeds from maturities of investments in marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities during and was million and  respectively  and resulted from the private sale of common and preferred stock  exercise of common stock options  and proceeds from sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million and resulted primarily from the march sale of  shares of series a exchangeable preferred stock the exchangeable preferred  at a price per share of  to warburg pincus private equity viii  lp warburg and certain other investors for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
we incurred offering expenses of million in connection with the sale of exchangeable preferred  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million 
on may   at our annual meeting of stockholders  our stockholders voted to approve the issuance of shares of our common stock upon exchange of shares of the exchangeable preferred 
as a result of such approval  we issued a total of  shares of common stock upon exchange of  shares of exchangeable preferred 
based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs at least through the first quarter of  and potentially through the end of however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
we anticipate continuing our current development programs and or beginning other long term development projects involving our product candidates 
these projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
therefore  we may need to obtain additional funds from outside sources to continue research and development activities  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals and build sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of our product development programs  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and cost involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our future products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we will be required to raise additional capital to support our future operations  including commercialization of efaproxyn in the event we obtain regulatory approval to market efaproxyn for the treatment of patients with brain metastases originating from breast cancer 
we may seek to obtain this additional capital through arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings  or from other sources 
such arrangements  if successfully consummated  may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if we are unable to generate meaningful amounts of revenue from future product sales  if any  or cannot otherwise raise sufficient additional funds to support our operations  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs and our business and future prospects for revenue and profitability may be harmed 
obligations and commitments below is a schedule of timing of contractual commitments  by fiscal year  related to our leases and service contracts 
we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements 
to to after total operating lease obligations    contingent payment obligations   license agreement obligations    purchase obligations    total obligations     operating lease obligations represent future minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating leases for our facilities and certain office equipment  net of  of remaining sublease payments on excess space in our corporate offices 
contingent payment obligations represent a potential milestone payment that may be required under the terms of an agreement with a third party to provide certain trial management services in europe and south america in connection with the enrich trial 
under the terms of the original agreement  we were required to pay this third party approximately million if certain patient enrollment milestones were achieved in europe and south america in july in march  the agreement was amended to reduce the amount of the milestone payment from approximately million to  and to make certain other changes to the agreement 
as of december   we recorded a portion of the original million milestone payment in accrued research and development expenses equal to the number of patients actually enrolled as of december  relative to the patient enrollment milestone in the agreement 
license agreement obligations represent future milestone payments under our license agreement for pdx  due upon the passage of certain time periods after the effective date of the agreement  which could be paid earlier depending on the timing of achieving a development milestone 
purchase obligations represent annual minimum purchase requirements of efaproxiral sodium from hovione under our june manufacturing agreement  equal to  in   in   in  and  in each year thereafter through the end of the term of the agreement equal to the th anniversary of the date we obtain approval from the fda to market efaproxyn 
in the event that we do not meet these annual minimum purchase requirements  we have the option to pay extension fees to move the annual requirements out by a total of three years 
these extension fees are equal to  for a first extension   for a second extension  and  for a third and final extension  if necessary 
the company and hovione each have customary termination rights  including termination for material breach or other events relating to insolvency or bankruptcy 
in addition  we may terminate the agreement at any time if we decide to discontinue development or  if approved  marketing of efaproxyn 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial position are determined based on the application of our accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our critical accounting policies are important to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and the results presented in the financial statements require management to make judgments and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
we record the costs of clinical studies  clinical development  regulatory affairs  biostatistical data analysis  non clinical studies  basic research and licensing fees as a component to research and development expenses 
clinical study costs represent internal costs from personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contracted costs incurred by third party clinical research organizations to perform certain clinical trials 
in accordance with certain research and development agreements  we are obligated to make certain upfront payments upon execution of the agreement 
we record these upfront payments as prepaid research and development expenses 
such payments are recorded to research and development expense as services are performed or terms of the respective agreements are achieved 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate impairment of remaining prepaid research and development expenses 
we accrue research and development expenses for activity as incurred during the fiscal year and prior to receiving invoices from clinical sites and third party clinical research organizations 
we accrue external costs for clinical studies based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  dosing levels of patients enrolled  estimated costs to dose patients  and contracted costs with clinical research organizations and clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development  regulatory affairs and biostatistical data analysis and external costs related to non clinical studies and basic research as incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
we record upfront fees and milestone payments made under our licensing agreements as a research and development expense 
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
the carrying values of our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities approximate their market values based on quoted market prices 
we account for investments in marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
investments in marketable securities are classified as held to maturity and are carried at cost plus accrued interest 
substantially all of our marketable securities are held in corporate notes with remaining maturities ranging from one to fourteen months 
our finished drug inventory is expensed to clinical manufacturing expenses since we are still a development stage company and we have not received regulatory approval to market efaproxyn 
after regulatory approval  we will be required to capitalize any future costs of our marketed products at the lower of cost or market and then expense the sold inventory as a component of cost of goods sold 
the timing of future payments for finished drug inventory in relation to the timing of regulatory approval may cause variability in our future cost of goods sold and clinical manufacturing expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt new accounting rules surrounding share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in the first quarter of these new accounting rules will require us to record non cash stock based compensation expense in our financial statements for grants of employee stock options and other share based payments  based on their fair values 
we expect that the adoption of these new accounting rules will have a material impact on our net loss attributable to common stockholders and our net loss per share in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in marketable securities  and accounts payable 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the average duration of the issues in our portfolio as of december  is approximately six months 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities of million are all classified as held to maturity and were held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting mainly of high grade corporate notes 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
due in part to this factor  our interest income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations
