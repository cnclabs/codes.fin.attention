item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts and as noted this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations 
for more information on forward looking statements  refer to the special note on forward looking statements at the front of this annual report on form k 
our products have historically centered on fax and print servers and related technologies 
starting in  our revenues began to decline as competition increased  with respect to print server products  while at the same time the internet and other networking technologies advanced 
as a result  we experienced annual operating losses beginning in through we redirected our efforts to focus on server appliances and on development efforts to integrate existing and future products with the internet and emerging networking technologies 
we introduced our new products  the faxpress in february  faxpress in november  faxpress sbe in february and the faxpress in september in september  we launched our newest enterprise level fax servers  the faxpress premier analog and faxpress premier digital 
today  our analog fax servers can provide up to fax channels  the digital servers up to t fax channels  the isdn servers up to fax channels and the e servers up to fax channels 
our current faxpress and faxpress premier software versions are and  respectively  to support our hardware 
improved cash management and operating results resulted in positive operating cash flows in  and cash balances increased to million at december  from million and million at december  and december   respectively 
from time to time  component manufacturers announce the end of life of certain of their products and at the same time introduce replacement components which are usually more efficient or cost effective 
we have been informed by several of our component suppliers that new components are available to replace certain of their end of life components currently used in our faxpress products 
we have been replenishing  through secondary markets  and keeping approximately two years worth of these end of life components in an effort to guarantee a smooth supply of our faxpress products to our customers 
we believe this will give us ample time to develop new replacement products 
we believe that most of these end of life components will be utilized within approximately the next two years  resulting in insignificant amounts of excessive inventory or none at all 
we believe that castelle s liquidity continues to be strong despite these purchases  as our cash balances have increased during the periods when the parts were purchased 
even though we believe we have secured enough components for the next two years  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional components in the future  or be able to redesign new products in a timely manner 
these end of life products represented  of the ending inventory balance at december  as compared to  at december  critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have defined a critical accounting policy as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f note that preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates about future events and their effects cannot be made with certainty 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  aicpa statement of position no 
sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exits 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
product revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and returns can be reasonably estimated 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the contingency  customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
shipment generally occurs and title and risk of loss is transferred when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
we enter into agreements with some of our distributors that permit limited stock rotation rights 
these stock rotation rights allow the distributor to return products for credit but require the purchase of additional products of equal value 
customers who purchase products directly from us also have limited return rights  which expire days from product shipment 
revenues subject to stock rotation or other return rights are reduced by our estimates of anticipated exchanges and returns 
pursuant to our agreements with distributors  we also protect our distributors exposure related to the impact of price reductions 
future price adjustments are estimated and accrued at the time of sale as a reduction in revenue 
we generally provide our distributors the opportunity to earn volume incentive rebates based on sales volume achieved during the fiscal quarter 
these incentive rebates are accrued in the quarter incurred and recorded as a reduction in revenue 
we also provide co op and market development funds to our distributors 
these incentives are accrued at the time revenue is recognized and recorded as a reduction in revenue 
we offer a standard trade in discount to all of our end user customers under which the customer  upon trade in of any previously purchased product  is entitled to a discount from our published price list on any product included in our current product offerings 
we require our customers to physically return the previously purchased products to qualify for the trade in discount 
we account for the trade in discount as a reduction of revenue at the time the product is traded in and a new product is purchased 
payment terms to our distributors and customers are generally days  cash in advance  or by credit card 
we evaluate product sales through our distribution channels and the related reserve requirement to establish an estimate for our sales returns reserve by reviewing detailed point of sales and on hand inventory reports provided to us by our channel partners 
based on a combination of historical return experience  the sales activities to end user customers by our channel partners and the level of inventories on hand at the channel partners  we determine our returns reserve at the end of each financial period  and increase or reduce the reserve balance accordingly 
we provide standard support to our customers for an initial period of days  which includes advance swap of the defective hardware and software  bug fixes  software upgrades and technical support 
in addition to standard support  we also offer our customers the option to purchase extended support at the time of product purchase or anytime thereafter 
extended support covers hardware and software for a period of one year 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence with respect to the fair value of the standard support contracts based on standalone sales and renewals of our one year extended support contracts 
the fair value of our day support contracts included with product sales is determined by pro rating the related one year extended support contracts 
we recognize revenue from extended support contracts ratably over the period of the contract 
we do not sell software  which is incorporated into our hardware  separately  other than for our customers to purchase as an upgrade to their existing products when we announce a major release of the software 
product warranty hardware is warranted for one year from the date of sale and is repaired free of charge 
provisions for estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time products are shipped as a charge to cost of sales 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should product failure rates  material usage or service delivery cost differ from our estimates  revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could affect the amount of gross profit reported 
distributor programs and incentives we enter into agreements with some of our distributors that permit limited stock rotation rights 
these stock rotation rights allow the distributor to return products for credit but require the purchase of additional products of equal value 
we also protect our distributors exposure related to the impact of price reductions 
we generally provide our distributors the opportunity to earn volume incentive rebates based upon the amount of sales volume achieved during the fiscal quarter 
we also provide co op and market development funds to our distributors 
if market conditions were to change  we may take actions to increase distributor incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
moreover  if the actual incentive offerings are different from our estimates  or if the actual incentive claims are significantly higher than our historical experience  then revisions to the estimated incentive programs may be required resulting in additional reductions to revenue 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for these distributor programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
credit  collection and allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing customer credit evaluations based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
when credit criteria are not met  we require cash on delivery or payment by credit card before products are shipped 
on a quarterly basis  we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentration  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
such losses have generally been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
three customers accounted for  and of accounts receivable at december   and  respectively 
inventories and related write downs for excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based on assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
in light of the approximately two years worth of end of life components we had purchased to ensure a smooth supply of our faxpress products to our customers  our management periodically reviews the usage  supply and inventory levels of these parts to determine whether additional purchases or excessive inventory provisions are necessary 
at december   we have approximately  worth of end of life components on hand  as compared to  at december  and we believe that most of these components will be utilized in the following two years  resulting in insignificant amounts of excessive inventory  or none at all 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount of any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the establishment or reversal of any valuation allowance is based in large part on projected future taxable income

provision for income tax in fiscal and  we recorded non cash tax benefits of million and  respectively  as a result of releasing portions of our tax valuation allowance 
consequently  as of december   we had recorded a total of million of deferred tax assets 
we have not reported significant income tax expenses because we have been able to utilize available nol and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income 
prior to december   our nols were fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainly surrounding the likelihood of their realization 
due to our continued profitability over the past quarters ended december  and a determination that it is more likely than not that certain future tax benefits will be realized  a portion of our deferred tax assets were recognized during the fourth quarters of fiscal and liquidity and capital resources december  december  cash and cash equivalents   working capital   working capital ratio since our initial public offering of common stock in december  our principal source of funding has been cash from our operations  with some funding from capital equipment lease lines 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to cash provided by operating activities of million and  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by purchases of  of equipment and licenses 
our operating activities generated cash of million in  primarily due to operating income and  of reduction of inventories as we continue to use a portion of the end of life parts and other components purchased during fiscal and in  net cash provided by financing activities was  primarily from proceeds from issuance of common stock 
we acquired additional equipment and licenses of   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect our future capital expenditures to be more consistent with spending levels prior to in  net cash provided by financing activities was  primarily from proceeds from issuance of common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors authorized us  from time to time  to repurchase at market prices  up to million worth of shares of our common stock for cash in open market  negotiated or block transactions 
the timing of such transactions has depended and will depend on market conditions  other corporate strategies and has been and will be at the discretion of our management 
no time limit was set for the completion of this program 
as of december   we have repurchased from open market and negotiated transactions a total of million shares for million  at an average per share price of 
we performed no stock repurchases during and however  we may continue to execute our buyback program as we deem necessary 
we renewed our line of credit with silicon valley bank in august in september  we increased our line of credit to million from million 
this line of credit expires in august of the increase in our line of credit affected none of the previous terms of our existing line of credit 
the revolving line of credit provides for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under this line of credit agreement are collateralized by all of our assets and bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
as with our previous facility  we are required to maintain certain minimum cash and investment balances with the bank and meet certain other financial covenants 
as of december   we have not drawn down on the line of credit and were in compliance with debt covenants and all other terms of the agreement 
we lease certain of our equipment under various operating and capital leases that expire at various dates through the lease agreements frequently include renewal  escalation clauses and purchase provisions  and require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance costs 
as of december   we had  outstanding under a loan and security agreement  which is subject to an interest rate of 
we lease our headquarters in morgan hill  california 
we extended our building lease for a term of five years commencing on june  and expiring on may   with one conditional three year renewal option  which if exercised  would extend the lease to may  commencing with rent at ninety five percent of fair market value 
as of december   future minimum payments under the lease were  the following represents combined aggregate maturities for all our financing and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital finance lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations we believe that our existing cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
if we have a need for additional capital resources  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  secure additional lines of credit or obtain other third party financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our existing and new products  if any  and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
failure to raise such additional financing  if needed  may result in our inability to achieve our long term business objectives 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  because of our dependency on a small number of distributors for a significant portion of the sales of our products  the loss of any of our major distributors or their inability to satisfy their payment obligations to us could have a significant adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  however  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
while much of our revenue is transacted in us dollars  certain spending is transacted in pounds sterling 
these amounts are not currently material to our financial statements  therefore we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of our money market accounts and related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the highly liquid nature of these investments 
however  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings
