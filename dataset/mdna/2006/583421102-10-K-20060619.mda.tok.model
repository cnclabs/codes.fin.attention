item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors 
throughout this section  dollar amounts  except per share amounts  are in thousands 
our fiscal year begins on april and ends on march references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  and references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  overview measurement specialties  inc the company or we is a global leader in designing and manufacturing sensors for original equipment manufacturers and end users 
the company continues to expand our business at a relatively high rate through organic growth and through acquisitions 
with the sale of our consumer products business effective december   the company now has one reportable segment  a sensor business 
accordingly  all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the fiscal years ended march  and exclude the results of these discontinued operations  except as otherwise noted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the consumer products segment designed and manufactured sensor based consumer products  primarily as an original equipment manufacturer oem  that were sold to retailers and distributors in the united states and europe 
consumer products included bathroom and kitchen scales  tire pressure gauges and distance estimators 
we have six primary manufacturing facilities strategically located in united states  china  france and germany enabling the company to produce and market world wide a broad range of sensors that use advanced technologies to measure precise ranges of physical characteristics including pressure  position  force  vibration  humidity and photo optics 
these sensors are used for automotive  medical  consumer  military aerospace and industrial applications 
the company s sensor products include pressure and electromagnetic displacement sensors  transducers  piezoelectric polymer film sensors  custom microstructures  load cells  accelerometers  optical sensors and humidity sensors 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the year ended march  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses income selling  general and administrative non cash equity based compensation litigation expense research and development customer funded development amortization of acquired intangibles restructuring costs total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense  net other expense income income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit from continuing operations income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations before income taxes consumer income from discontinued operations before income taxes shaevitz uk income taxes from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  before gain gain on disposition of discontinued operations net of income taxes income from discontinued operations net income executive summary measurement specialties has seen a significant amount of change over the last several years 
in may  we embarked upon an aggressive restructuring effort to improve the operating performance of the company 
a key component of this restructuring was the elimination of underutilized facilities to consolidate our operations in shenzhen  china and hampton  virginia 
in fiscal year  the company embarked on an ambitious growth strategy for the sensor division  to be achieved through acquisition and organic growth 
to that end  the company made six acquisitions during fiscal  and two acquisitions in fiscal the acquisitions see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the results of operations of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated statement of operations as of and since their respective dates of purchase 
additionally  during the month of april  the company made two additional acquisitions which added a range of temperature sensors to our product line up see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
to finance the acquisitions  we expanded our  credit facility to  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
having completed the restructuring and acquisitions  measurement specialties is now a global sensor solutions company with a broad range of technologies and capabilities 
our focus remains engineered solutions where we can use our engineering and manufacturing talent and depth of knowledge and experience in sensors to provide a complete solution to our customers  as well as bundle products together 
we also have a substantial end user business for high quality off the shelf sensors and transducers used for test  instrumentation and process control 
a key to our manufacturing strategy is leveraging the significant infrastructure we now have in shenzhen  china 
this infrastructure has enabled us to reduce costs and improve financial performance while continuing to provide our customers with low cost  highly reliable products 
growth strategy having divested the low margin consumer business  the company is now wholly engaged in pursuing aggressive growth in sensors  with an established goal of achieving annual revenues of million by fiscal year this rapid growth in excess of cagr compound annual growth rate will continue to come through a combination of organic growth and acquisition 
the company is targeting organic growth of per year  primarily through custom engineered medium to high volume oem applications for which the typical development cycle lasts from to months 
in addition to the two acquisitions this fiscal year  and following our six acquisitions in fiscal year  management still believes there is room on the balance sheet to support the leveraged acquisition of companies that can provide entry into new technologies  geographies and customer segments 
the company will continue to pursue acquisitions that make a good strategic fit without specific timetables for closure 
work continues on integrating acquisitions for inherent synergies in sales and marketing  engineering and manufacturing 
this is particularly true for the largest acquisition of fiscal year  hlp  where opportunities exist to lower manufacturing costs and leverage the company sales force on behalf of promising hlp technologies 
by organizing engineering  product development and manufacturing resources into seven product families  the company has created a flexible structure that can facilitate integration and support growth 
this scalable structure enables the company to readily assimilate acquisitions  prioritize engineering resources  and respond better to market opportunities in key industries 
processes have been established for the progressive integration of support functions such as supply chain  information technology  financial management  sales and marketing 
patterns are being established to cross fertilize the sales efforts across product families 
in addition to the company s traditional oem business  the company has a growing end user business as a result of recent acquisitions 
accelerometers  pressure transducers  linear variable differential transformers lvdts and derivative linear displacement products made by the company are all used by customers for applications in test and measurement  instrumentation and process control 
these devices are packaged products sense elements with amplification  compensation and sometimes value add which carry a higher average selling price 
the company is pushing these sales through direct selling to high volume users  new distribution channels to small and medium volume users and through e commerce on its own website 
trends 
we anticipate our overall average gross margins for our sensor business to decline to approximately in fiscal year as compared to gross margins of and for fiscal years and  respectively 
there are several factors impacting margins  including sales growth strategies  product sales mix and our cost structure 
the sensors market is highly fragmented with hundreds of niche players 
while the worldwide sensors market that we serve is expected to have a compound annual growth rate cagr  we expect to gain share and grow our sensor business in excess of the market primarily through custom engineered medium to high volume oem applications for which the typical development cycle lasts to months 
as a result of this growth strategy  we anticipate pursuing high volume sensor business that carry lower gross margins than our historical experience  which influence our overall sensor gross margins 
additionally  a number of our new products from recent acquisitions carry lower margins than our historical experience 
furthermore  the appreciation of the chinese renminbi rmb relative to the us dollar has resulted in additional pressure on lowering our margins since a large portion of our products are manufactured in our china facility with some of our costs denominated in rmb 
partially offsetting the aforementioned items impacting margins  the company continually monitors costs and pursues various cost control measures and sales initiatives to improve margins 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company will begin recognizing compensation costs in our statement of operations related to stock options  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment 
compensation costs from stock options had been previously reported on a pro forma basis and not recorded in the statement of operations 
additionally  with the increase in acquired intangible assets from our recent acquisitions and our expanded credit facility to  in april  the company will incur higher levels of amortization expense and interest costs 
the company s operations are expected to support these higher costs and generate sufficient cash flows to not only service the debt but also to pay down debt 
the company currently manufactures from a leased facility in china 
in order to  among other things  control costs and to provide reliable and adequate capacity  the company is planning to build a factory in china to replace the current leased facility 
the overall cost of the factory is expected to be in the magnitude of  to  and should be constructed over the next two years 
on march   the company entered into a definitive year lease agreement for land in shenzhen  guang dong province  china for a total cost of approximately the company plans to finance the new facility through a combination of sources  including cash generated from operations and through additional borrowings 
please refer to item business in this report on form k for additional details regarding the basis of the trends described above 
establishment of offshore holding companies 
in the quarter ended june   the company reorganized its asian operations under an offshore holding company  kenabell holding limited  a british virgin island company kenabell holding bvi 
as part of the reorganization  a new entity was formed under kenabell holding bvi in the cayman islands  measurement limited ml 
a significant portion of the consumer business in asia was transferred into ml cayman during the quarter ended june  these holding companies were formed as part of a foreign tax planning restructuring  and to facilitate the sale of assets of our consumer products business 
accordingly  the gain on sale of the consumer business was effectively not taxed  since kenabell holdings bvi did not conduct business directly in hong kong 
msi sensors asia limited formerly named measurement limited  organized in hong kong owns all of the shares of msi sensors china ltd 
formerly named jingliang electronics shenzhen co 
ltd  organized in the peoples republic of china 
kenabell holding bvi owns all of the shares of msi sensors asia limited and ml cayman was subsequently sold to fervent group limited effective december  in the quarter ended march   as part of a foreign tax planning restructuring  the company completed the reorganization of its european subsidiaries  which includes entran sa and humirel sa 
this reorganization involved transferring ownership of these subsidiaries to a cyprus holding company under kenabell holding bvi  named acalon holding limited 
in conjunction with this reorganization  the ownership of kenabell holding bvi was also transferred to measurement specialties foreign holdings corporation  a delaware corporation 
all the companies are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group 
changes in our business discontinued operations effective december   we completed the sale of the consumer segment to fervent group limited fgl  whereby we sold our consumer product segment  including its cayman island subsidiary  ml 
fgl is a company controlled by the owners of river display limited rdl  our long time partner and primary supplier of consumer products in shenzhen  china 
accordingly  the related financial statements for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
we placed our united kingdom subsidiary  measurement specialties uk limited referred to herein as schaevitz uk  into receivership on june  pursuant to the terms of a mortgage debenture dated february  certain assets of schaevitz uk related to the foil strain gauge sensor business were reacquired during in the acquisition of polaron components  ltd 
as a result of placing schaevitz uk into receivership and selling terraillon  these entities have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial results for accordingly  all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended march   and  and consolidated balance sheets as of march  and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations except as otherwise noted 
sale of assets on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of our thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business 
assets sold to conair included  among other things  the worldwide rights to the thinner brand name  exclusive rights to the thinner designs in north america  all inventories of finished scales  open customer purchase orders  and patents 
the gain on the sale of the thinner related assets are presented as discontinued operations since they relate to the consumer business 
recent accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment 
the new fasb rule requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements  rather than disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the scope of sfas no 
r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
 as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
under the effective date provisions included in sfas no 
r  registrants would have been required to implement the statement s requirements as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june   or after december  for small business issuers 
the new rule allows registrants to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next interim period  that begins after june   or december  for small business issuers 
the company will be required to apply sfas no 
r beginning with the quarter ending june  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material effect on its financial position and results of operations consistent with the pro forma disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and represents another step in the fasb s goal to converge its standards with those issued by the iasb 
among other changes  sfas no 
requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
responses to this exposure draft are currently being evaluated by the fasb 
recently adopted accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  related to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp is effective immediately 
fsp states that the tax deduction of qualified domestic production activities  which is provided by the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas no 
consequently  the impact of the deduction  which is effective january   will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company s income tax returns 
the adoption of fsp did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of jobs act 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance related to the jobs act provision for the limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
although adoption is effective immediately  fsp states that a company is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
the company has evaluated the impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
since the company has elected not to repatriate  these provisions did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  the company has not adjusted its tax expense or net deferred tax assets to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned  which occurs when the following four conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products may be sold with a provision allowing the customer to return a portion of products 
the company provides for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
the amount of actual returns could differ from estimates 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
the company utilizes manufacturing representatives as sales agents for certain of its products 
such representatives do not receive orders directly from customers  take title to or physical possession of products  or invoice customers 
accordingly  revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of the company s thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  including worldwide rights to the thinner brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner designs in north america 
the company has accounted for the sale of this business under the guidance of eitf as a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale was in fact an up front payment for future lost margins  the majority of the gain on sale has been deferred and was amortized into revenues in future periods over the estimated remaining lives for those products sold to conair 
see note for a discussion of the sale of the business to conair 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the majority of the company s accounts receivable is due from manufacturers of electronic  automotive  military and industrial products 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customers financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts and other sales allowances 
accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
amounts collected on trade accounts receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed the company s estimates and changes to its estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates historical cost 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
products that have existed in inventory for one calendar year with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and fully reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
furthermore  consideration is given to ultimate circumstances when recording inventory reserves and the disposal of inventory considered obsolete 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may result in additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of the industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
goodwill impairment per sfas no 
 management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently under certain circumstances 
such circumstances include i significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii unanticipated competition  iv a loss of key personnel  v a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  and vi recognition of an impairment loss in a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
management must make assumptions regarding estimating the fair value of the company reporting units 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in the company s statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the goodwill 
as of march   the company has tested its goodwill for impairment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and no impairment charges were deemed necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion of the impact of sfas no 
on the company s financial position and results of operations 
acquisitions in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items are based upon management s estimates 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
purchased intangibles and goodwill are not deductible for tax purposes 
however  purchase accounting requires the establishment of deferred tax liabilities on purchased intangibles other than goodwill that will be reflected as a tax benefit on our future statements of operations in proportion to and over the amortization period of the related intangible asset 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii 
significant negative industry or economic trends  iii 
significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and iv 
a change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using a projected discounted cash flow method at the lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
in the event impairment is indicated  fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method  appraisal or other accepted techniques 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our consolidated statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency translation and transaction the functional currency of the company s foreign operations is the applicable local currency 
the foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
accumulated comprehensive income loss consists of net earnings for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as receivables and payables 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income and expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income  which is reviewed annually 
during the fiscal year ended march  the company provided a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets since it believed at the time that enough uncertainty existed regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
the company reversed this valuation allowance for the year ended march  the analysis of positive evidence supporting the conclusion that the valuation allowance was no longer applicable included the assessment of three key issues that principally lead to the allowance substantial operating losses  debt and pending litigation 
the analysis supporting the reversal of the valuation allowance was straight forward  as the positive evidence which could be objectively verified outweighed the negative evidence 
current and expected results of the company  as well as taking into account the status of litigation at that time  indicated that the valuation allowance was not needed 
the company had fully executed a restructuring whereby the company returned to profitability  as supported by the strong earnings during fiscal  coupled with the elimination of debt  a forecast indicating the company would generate more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets and the status of litigation  the company reversed the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding income taxes and the status of the company s litigation 
the company annually evaluates positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is required 
this evaluation is primarily based upon projected future earnings and various tax strategies 
transfer pricing refers to the prices that one member of a group of related companies charges to another member of the group for goods  services  or the use of intellectual property 
if two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries  the laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those charged by unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm s length 
if one or more of the countries in which our affiliated companies are located believes that transfer prices were manipulated by our affiliate companies in a way that distorts the true taxable income of the companies  the laws of countries where our affiliated companies are located could require us to redetermine transfer prices and thereby reallocate the income of our affiliate companies in order to reflect these transfer prices 
any reallocation of income from one of our companies in a lower tax jurisdiction to an affiliated company in a higher tax jurisdiction would result in a higher overall tax liability to us 
moreover  if the country from which the income is being reallocated does not agree to the reallocation  the same income could be subject to taxation by both countries 
warranty reserve the company s sensor products generally are marketed under warranties to end users of up to one year 
factors affecting the company s warranty liability include the number of products sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and cost per claim 
the company provides for estimated product warranty obligations at the time of sale  based on its historical warranty claims experience and assumptions about future warranty claims 
this estimate is susceptible to changes in the near term based on introductions of new products  product quality improvements and changes in end user application and or behavior 
contingencies and litigation liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
stock based compensation the company has two stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note the company applies apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its plans 
there was no employee compensation expense recognized in  and as a result of options issued to employees 
the effect on net income and earnings per share is presented on a pro forma basis in note u  if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas statement  accounting for stock based compensation  using the assumptions described in note to the consolidated financial statements regarding stock based employee plans 
the proforma disclosures are sensitive to the expected life  volatility and discount rate model assumptions 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except percentages analysis of consolidated statement of operations change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses income selling  general and administrative research and development customer funded development amortization of acquired intangibles total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense income income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations before income taxes consumer income taxes from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  before gain gain on disposition of discontinued operations net of income tax income from discontinued operations net income the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and include the results of the continuing operations of the company 
the company sold the consumer business effective december   and accordingly  the consumer business is classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial results for all periods presented 
net sales 
sales increased  or from  to  excluding sales from fiscal and fiscal acquisitions of  and  respectively  sales increased  or 
the increase in net sales in the fiscal year ended march  is primarily the result of increased demand in our pressure  force  humidity  piezo film and traffic sensor product lines 
contributing significantly to the growth of pressure and humidity lines is continued expansion of existing and new platforms in automotive and off road vehicles 
the company s pressure products are also capturing increasing market share in medical applications 
piezo film growth is occurring in the consumer goods applications and in anti tamper devices used in encryption security and in automatic teller machines atms 
overall  we expect sales to continue to grow based on our sales growth strategies with high volume sensor business  and organic growth with new and existing products  as well as the impact of acquisitions 
gross margin 
overall  gross margin gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  gross margin as a percent of net sales for our base sensor business which excludes the effects of acquisitions in and decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in our overall margins and margins of our traditional sensor business excluding acquisitions is due to several factors  including a shift in sales to products with lower margins and reductions in pricing to secure a higher volume of business  as well as the impact of the appreciation of the chinese rmb 
on an ongoing basis our gross margin for sensors will fluctuate due to product mix  sales volume  raw material costs  foreign currency exchange rates and other such factors 
the increases in costs should be partially offset by sales growth in oem platforms for automotive and in medical applications  increased prices and improved supply chain dynamics 
overall  margins are expected to decrease slightly to approximate next fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in sg a costs mainly reflect the impact of the acquisitions and related integration costs  and additional sales and engineering staff to support higher sales 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a costs actually declined from to  reflecting net sales increasing at a higher rate than costs  improved leverage by consolidating operations  and various cost control measures  including lower employee profit sharing and lower professional fees 
last year s professional fees were higher than normal primarily because of the costs associated with the initial implementation of sarbanes oxley requirements 
research and development 
customer funded development for the fiscal year ended march  increased to compared to for the fiscal year ended march  on a net basis  research and development costs increased this increase was due to the higher costs in research and development spending due to our continued efforts to develop new products  improve existing products and the impact of acquisitions 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
the increase in amortization of acquired intangibles  which includes the amortization of customer relationships  patents  and trade names  to  for the year ended march  directly relates to the acquisitions and the timing of the acquisitions

other expense income  net 
other expense income fluctuated to an expense of for the year ended march  from income of the prior fiscal year 
the fluctuation to an expense from income is mainly attributed to the foreign currency exchange loss of approximately incurred during fiscal  which was mainly due to the change in the chinese rmb rate relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately percent during the year ended march  excluding the impact of the adjustments noted below  our overall effective tax rate has decreased from approximately percent last year to approximately percent during the current year  due to the shift in earnings before taxes to jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
there was an adjustment of approximately during that increased income tax expenses 
this adjustment was the revaluation of the related us net deferred tax assets based on a lower estimated effective us tax rate 
the lower overall us effective tax rate was the result of a larger apportionment to a state with a lower tax rate  which was mainly due to centralizing the company s principal headquarters and much of the manufacturing operations in the us to hampton  virginia from new jersey 
as a result of this change in apportionment  the effective tax rate in the united states has decreased from percent to approximately percent 
the shift in earnings can be attributed to  among other things  the changes in our business with the sale of the consumer business and the impact of the acquisitions during the past two years  specifically with regard to the amortization of acquired intangibles and higher interest expense 
due to  among other things  the volume of manufacturing in the us and our net operating loss carry forwards in the us  we do not expect the american jobs creation act of to have an immediate or significant impact on our effective tax rates

net sales 
sales increased  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal excluding sales from fiscal acquisitions of  sales increased  or 
the increase in net sales for our base sensor business in the fiscal year ended march  was primarily a result of increased demand in our pressure  liquid level and traffic sensor products 
the significant contributor to the increase in net sales for these lines is the expanded demand for the automotive sector with many new platforms adopting our sensor technology which resulted in strong growth for this market segment 
strong organic growth was also realized in our acceleration  pressure  security and tilt products in the industrial  high purity  off road vehicle test and measurement and commercial market segments 
approximately  or  of the sales from recent acquisitions are attributable to elekon  entran  and humirel 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percent of net sales for our base sensor business which excludes the effects of acquisitions decreased slightly to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  this change is due to the increase in sales of automotive sensors  which carries a lower gross margin than our average sensor business 
also contributing to the margin decline is higher commodity costs in our core sensor lines

during the fiscal year ended march   there were no litigation expenses 
the company settled the sec investigation and the class action lawsuit during fiscal  but for amounts which had been accrued during the prior fiscal year 
we recorded a net charge of  during the fiscal year ended march  relating to the sec investigation  class action lawsuit  and the hibernia capital partners litigation 
this net charge represented the combination of a  charge relating to the sec investigation  an additional  charge relating to the class action lawsuit  which was partially offset by the reversal of from the prior accrual upon the favorable settlement of the hibernia lawsuit

interest expense  net 
the increase in interest expense is attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  partially offset by a lower average interest rate 
the increase in debt was due to acquisitions 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit realized during fiscal year was due to the reversal of the million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and the income tax expense incurred during fiscal year does not reflect any such adjustments 
the current year tax rate of approximately percent is lower than the prior year effective rate of approximately percent  after taking into account the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance 
the decrease in the effective tax rate as compared to last year is mainly due to three factors i a larger portion of income allocated to jurisdictions with lower tax rates  ii the recordation of deferred tax assets associated with certain temporary or timing differences for inventory reserves and depreciation  and iii the amortization of deferred tax liabilities relating to a number of the acquisitions 
during fiscal  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was reversed 
based on the evaluation of relevant factors in fiscal  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was recorded because it was determined that it was more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
in arriving at our conclusion to reverse the valuation allowance at march   we took into consideration the guidance provided by fas  after considering both positive and negative evidence 
our analysis of positive evidence supporting the conclusion that the valuation allowance was no longer applicable included the assessment of three key issues that principally lead to the allowance substantial operating losses  debt and pending litigation 
our analysis supporting the reversal of the valuation allowance was straight forward  as the positive evidence which could be objectively verified outweighed the negative evidence 
the current and expected results of the company  as well as taking into account the status of litigation  indicated that the valuation allowance was not needed 
the company had fully executed a restructuring whereby the company returned to profitability  as supported by the earnings during fiscal liquidity and capital resources operating working capital accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased by  from  as of march  to  as of march  the increase was attributable to an increase in accounts receivable of  from  at march  to  at march   and an increase in inventory of  from  at march  to  at march   which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of  from  at march  to  at march  the  increase in operating working capital is partially attributed to the  of net operating working capital from the acquisition of hl planar and atex 
the increase in trade accounts receivable is mainly due to higher sales  and the number of days receivable ratio net trade account receivables divided by net sales times days improved from days at march  to days at march  the increase in inventory is primarily due to higher sales  as well as our continued efforts to reposition and establish inventory buffers in order to reduce manufacturing lead times 
we anticipate improving inventory turnover to historical levels 
cash provided from operating activities increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  provided for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in cash provided by operations reflects the  increase in depreciation and amortization and the  increase in the provision for inventory obsolescence 
the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects the added depreciation and amortization associated with acquisitions 
the increase in inventory obsolescence relates to changes in technology and designs for medical and other product lines 
also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operations is the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  which increased mainly due to certain capital lease liabilities 
investing activities included cash payments  net of cash acquired  of  for the acquisition of hl planar and atex  as well as adjustments to finalize purchase accounting for acquisitions 
capital spending increased to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march  approximately  of the capital spending in is attributable to investment in revenue generating projects at our shenzhen  china facility and the initial costs capitalized for the planned construction of a new facility in china

other comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net earnings for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the increase in other comprehensive income from the changes in the exchange rates is primarily due to the changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and rmb

seasonality sales of sensor products are not seasonal 
inflation we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our revenues generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a certain level of foreign currency exchange risk 
most of our revenues are priced in united states dollars 
most of our costs and expenses are priced in united states dollars  with the remaining priced in chinese renminbi rmb  euros and hong kong dollars 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the sales out of the united states dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
united states sales were   and  or   and of net sales  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
sales from our foreign facilities were   and  or   and of net sales  for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
we are exposed to foreign currency transaction and translation losses  which might result from adverse fluctuations in the value of the euro  hong kong dollar and chinese renminbi 
at march    and we had net assets of   and  respectively  in the united states 
at march    and we had net assets of   and  respectively  in china subject to fluctuations in the value of the chinese renminbi against the united states dollar

at march    and we had net assets liabilities of   and respectively  in europe  subject to fluctuations in the value of the euro against the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the united states dollar

china adopted a floating currency system on january   unifying the market and official rates of foreign exchange 
on july   the rmb increased in value by approximately as compared to the us dollar  and during the remainder of calendar  the rmb appreciated by an additional 
the chinese government announced that it will no longer peg the rmb to the us dollar  but established a currency policy letting the rmb trade in a narrow band against a basket of currencies 
based on our net exposure of renminbi to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate a negative operating income impact of approximately for every appreciation in rmb against the us dollar assuming no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
we continue to consider various alternatives to hedge this exposure  and have considered  but do not currently use  foreign currency contracts as a hedging strategy 
we are attempting to manage this exposure through  among other things  pricing and monitoring balance sheet exposures for payables and receivables 
based on the net exposures of euros to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a positive operating income impact of for every appreciation in euros relative to the us dollar assuming no associated costs increases or currency hedging 
the company has a number of foreign currency exchange contracts in europe 
these currency contracts have a total notional amount of  with exercise dates through february at an average exchange rate of euro to us dollar conversion rate 
since these derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges under fasb  changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings  not in other comprehensive income 
as of march  and  the fair value of these contracts was liability of and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that these currencies will remain stable or will fluctuate to our benefit 
to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risks  we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices 
however  to date  other than for the foreign currency exchange contracts acquired with the purchase of humirel  we have not done so 
under our revolving credit facility we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility accrues at a rate based on either a london inter bank offered rate libor rate plus a libor margin or at an indexed prime based rate plus an index margin 
the libor or index rate is at our election 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  based on the  of total debt outstanding under this facility at march   an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and decrease our are pre tax profitability by we do not hedge this interest rate exposure
