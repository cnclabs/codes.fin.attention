item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the company operates two value rental car brands  dollar and thrifty 
the majority of its customers pick up their vehicles at airport locations 
both brands are value priced and the company seeks to be the industry s low cost provider 
leisure customers rent vehicles for longer periods than business customers  on average  providing lower transaction costs 
the company believes its vehicle utilization is consistently higher than that of its competitors 
both dollar and thrifty operate through a network of company owned stores and franchisees 
the majority of the company s revenue is generated from renting vehicles to customers through company owned stores  with lesser amounts generated by fees and leasing revenue from franchisees 
throughout  the company s revenues were positively impacted by franchise acquisitions and stronger rental demand due to increased travel 
total rental day volume increased with same store volume increasing by 
however  year over year revenue growth was negatively impacted by full year revenue per day being down 
airline passenger enplanements  an important driver for airport rental car demand  continued to grow in during the third and fourth quarters of  travel into the gulf coast was negatively impacted by three hurricanes 
during  the company achieved lower vehicle depreciation costs by changing the mix of vehicles in the fleet to include a higher proportion of non program vehicles  allowing the company to take advantage of the strong used car market 
during the second quarter of  the company s reservation growth was negatively impacted by its decision to change to non preferred status with expedia  which previously in had accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue and of total reservations 
during the remainder of  the company worked to recapture this lost volume through other internet channels  specifically its owned branded web sites  dollar 
com and thrifty 
com 
on august   the federal highway bill was signed into law  which removed unlimited vicarious liability for vehicle rental and leasing companies 
this law change limits the company s exposure for liability insurance to state minimum financial responsibility amounts and will save the company an estimated million to million annually 
in  the company s insurance costs decreased approximately million due to the law change 
beginning in  the company implemented a single operating company structure organized around functions rather than organized solely around the brand 
this structure focuses on operating both the dollar and thrifty brands with a single management team  sharing systems  vehicles  back office employees and service facilities  where possible 
the company believes this is a more efficient operating model 
the company has combined its information technology systems to gain efficiencies and facilitate additional growth 
the company has made significant progress in transitioning the thrifty business model from a franchise model to a corporate operating model  similar to dollar s business model 
the company s long term strategy is to operate both brands as corporate stores in the top us airport markets  the top eight canadian airport markets and in other key leisure destinations  and to operate through franchisees in the smaller markets and in markets outside the us and canada 
during  the company acquired franchise operations in seven us markets and opened two us greenfield locations 
during  rental day volume increased by over in company owned stores as a result of franchisee acquisitions and the opening of greenfield locations 
the company expects to continue to fund all remaining franchisee acquisitions with cash from operations 
the company s profitability is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of rental transactions  utilization of the vehicles and the volume and pricing of vehicles leased to franchisees 
significant changes in the purchase or disposal price of vehicles or interest rates can also have a significant effect on the company s profitability  depending on the ability of the company to adjust pricing and lease rates for these changes 
the company s business requires significant expenditures for vehicles and consequently  requires substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures 
the company expects its ongoing cash flow to exceed cash required to operate the business 
therefore in  the company repurchased  shares for a total of million 
the company has repurchased  shares at a cost of million since announcing the share repurchase program in july the company expects to increase share repurchases significantly in as it announced in february a new million share repurchase program  which will extend through december   to replace the existing program

the company uses both cash and letters of credit to support asset backed vehicle financing programs 
the company also uses letters of credit or insurance bonds to secure certain commitments related to airport concession agreements  insurance programs  and for other purposes 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  secured vehicle financing  the revolving credit facility and insurance bonds 
cash generated by operating activities of million for is primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation  favorable tax programs discussed below which provided the company deferral of tax payments on earnings to future years  and the increase in the reserve for public liability and property damage due to retaining risk of loss for insurance claims 
the liquidity necessary for purchasing vehicles is primarily obtained from secured vehicle financing  most of which is proceeds from sale of asset backed notes  sales proceeds from disposal of used vehicles and cash generated by operating activities

at december   dtg canada had approximately cnd million us million funded under this program

the company expects to continue using these sources of vehicle financing in and future years 
revolving credit facility the company has a million senior secured  revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility that expires on april  the revolving credit facility is used to provide working capital borrowings and letters of credit 
the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility is subject to the company s continued compliance with certain covenants  including a covenant that sets the maximum amount the company can spend annually on the acquisition of non vehicle capital assets  and certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a limitation on cash dividends and share repurchases

the majority of the company s vehicle debt is issued by special purpose finance entities as described herein all of which are fully consolidated into the company s financial statements 
the company has scheduled annual principal payments of approximately billion in  million in  million in and million in the company intends to use cash generated from operations and from the sale of vehicles for debt service and  subject to restrictions under its debt instruments  to make capital investments and repurchase its shares 
the company has historically repaid its debt and funded its capital investments aside from growth in its rental fleet with cash provided from operations and from the sale of vehicles 
the company has funded growth in its vehicle fleet by incurring additional secured vehicle debt and with cash generated from operations 
the company expects to incur additional debt from time to time to the extent permitted under the terms of its debt instruments 
the company has significant requirements for bonds and letters of credit to support its insurance programs and airport concession obligations 
at december   various insurance companies had issued million in bonds and various banks had issued million in letters of credit to secure these obligations 
interest rate risk the company s results of operations depend significantly on prevailing levels of interest rates because of the large amount of debt it incurs to purchase vehicles 
in addition  the company is exposed to increases in interest rates because a portion of its debt bears interest at floating rates 
the company estimates that  in  approximately of its average debt will bear interest at floating rates 
the amount of the company s financing costs affects the amount the company must charge its customers to be profitable 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting the company 
many of the company s other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on the company s overall operating costs will be greater for the company than for its competitors 
critical accounting policies and estimates as with most companies  the company must exercise judgment due to the level of subjectivity used in estimating certain costs included in its results of operations 
the more significant items include public liability and property damage the company does self insure or retain a portion of the exposure for losses related to public liability and property damage insurance 
the obligation for public liability and property damage represents an estimate of both reported accident claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported  up to the company s risk retention level 
the company records public liability and property damage expense on a monthly basis based on rental volume in relation to historical accident claim experience and trends  projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
management monitors the adequacy of the liability and monthly accrual rates based on the actuarial analysis of the development of the claim reserves  the accident claim history and rental volume 
since the ultimate disposition of the claims is uncertain  the likelihood of materially different results is possible  but the potential volatility of these estimates is reduced due to the frequency of actuarial reviews and significant historical data available for similar claims 
vehicle depreciation expense the company generally purchases to of its vehicles as program vehicles for which residual values are determined by depreciation rates that are established and guaranteed by the manufacturers 
the remaining to of the company s vehicles are purchased without the benefit of a manufacturer residual value guaranty program 
for these non program vehicles  the company must estimate what the residual values of these vehicles will be at the expected time of disposal to determine monthly depreciation rates by reviewing the projected market value for the vehicles at expected date of disposition and the overall outlook for the used car market 
the company continually evaluates estimated residual values 
differences between actual residual values and those estimated by the company result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded as an adjustment to depreciation expense 
the average life of the non program vehicles is seven to nine months and the company has generally experienced gains on disposal 
many factors affect the market value of used cars including increasing use of incentives by automobile manufacturers for new vehicles  limited or excess supply of used vehicles and overall economic conditions 
the likelihood that the company s estimates could materially change is possible due to the volatility of the used car market 
a one percent change in the expected residual value of non program vehicles sold during would have impacted vehicle depreciation expense  net by million 
bad debt expense the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and charges bad debt expense for estimated losses resulting from the inability of franchisees to make required payments 
management reviews monthly the individual accounts of franchisees with past due balances to determine the likelihood of collectibility and the amount of bad debt expense  if any  required for a particular franchisee 
factors considered include the aging and magnitude of past due amounts  the franchisees operating and credit history  market conditions  operating plan and available collateral 
the company records a reserve for the potential amounts owed by its franchisees that will not be collected when the amount of the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
accounts are typically charged off at the point the company reaches settlement or no longer pursues collection 
the likelihood that results may materially differ from amounts estimated is possible due to circumstances outside the franchisees or the company s control with respect to economic  industry or other external conditions 
in addition  as the company continues to acquire franchisees in larger markets  the corresponding receivables and risk of collectibility from franchisees will continue to decline 
new accounting standards beginning january   the company adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf no

fin no 
clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation from fasb statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations fasb no 
refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event and requires the recognition of such conditional obligations even though uncertainty exists

did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

this revised statement establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services focusing primarily on accounting for transactions with employees and carrying forward prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement method of accounting in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires measuring the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such costs must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the standard also requires estimating the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
the effective date of sfas no 
r is the first fiscal year beginning after june   january  for the company 
sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
the company adopted the modified prospective method under sfas no
