the rotliegend is the primary target horizon throughout most of the fences i project area  at depths from approximately  to  meters  except along the extreme southwest portion where the target reservoir is carbonates of the lower permian 
during  we drilled the kleka  our first rotliegend target  which began producing in early in  we agreed to assign our interest in the kleka well  including accrued gas sales proceeds and proceeds from ongoing production during and  to pogc as a credit against our earning requirement in fences i 
by december   we had met our earning requirement without crediting assignment of the kleka well  so we have agreed with pogc not to assign our interest in the kleka well  subject to the completion of formal documentation 
during  we drilled the mieszkow  an exploratory dry hole 
the mieszkow well demonstrated the need to apply modern seismic data processing and to assure careful handling of velocities in seismic data interpretation 
in and each year since  we have acquired  processed and interpreted a substantial amount of seismic data  with particular emphasis on utilizing acquisition  processing and interpretation techniques that have been used successfully in the rotliegend gas fields of the southern united kingdom gas basin 
in january  we entered into a farmout agreement with calenergy gas holdings ltd  the upstream gas business unit of midamerican energy holdings company  whereby calenergy gas had the right  but not the obligation  to earn a interest in all or a portion of the fences i project area 
in february  we completed the zaniemysl exploratory well in the fences i project area as a commercial well with proved reserves for the well estimated at approximately bcf of gas 
see item properties proved reserves 
together with our partners  pogc and calenergy gas  we are building facilities and will connect to the pipeline grid through a pipeline being built by pogc to produce gas from the zaniemysl structure at a permitted rate of mmcf of gas per day 
gas production is scheduled to commence in the second half of as a result of paying for the zaniemysl well  calenergy gas earned a interest in the approximately  acres surrounding the zaniemysl field referred to as the greater zaniemysl area  or gza 
outside of the calenergy gas gza  during the second half of  we and pogc drilled the rusocin well  the first well intentionally focused on a stratigraphic trap in the rotliegend 
in a january initial drill stem test  the well flowed gas from an meter feet section of the rotliegend sandstone target reservoir 
the top of the rotliegend was encountered at approximately  meters 
results of the initial drill stem test indicate that the reservoir may extend beyond the mapped faults  suggesting a larger reservoir along the wolsztyn high 
we believe the well may have discovered the lower edge of a pinch out at the top of the rotliegend sandstone with porosity 
during  we drilled the lugi well southeast of the rusocin well 
the lugi was another stratigraphic test of the pinch out play  and was determined to be noncommercial in december we are currently completing a two dimensional  or d  seismic acquisition program over the prospective pinch out area of fences i and anticipate completing our reinterpretation in the second half of  at which time we will decide when to drill another test of the pinch out play 
during the remainder of  as we have done each year since  we plan to acquire new d seismic data on selected structural prospects as well as along the apparent stratigraphic trap trend  we are also considering acquiring new three dimensional  or d  seismic data along the stratigraphic trap trend 
we intend to propose additional wells  both exploratory and appraisal  as our technical staff approves specific projects 
fences ii project area in january  we agreed to spend million on exploration costs in the fences ii project area to earn a interest 
we have completed the million earn in requirement 
as a result  pogc paid its share of costs during see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction fences ii commitment  for further information on how the commitment was satisfied 
the rotliegend is the primary target horizon throughout most of the fences ii project area  at depths from approximately  to  meters 
in early  conoco  inc  ruhrgas and pogc drilled a dry hole in the northeast of the fences ii area 
the well  although dry  did confirm the presence of reservoir quality rotliegend sandstone at a depth of more than  meters  which we believe makes virtually the entire block prospective for rotliegend  subject to accurate geophysical resolution of the trapping features 
during and  we reprocessed and interpreted several thousand kilometers of d seismic data to develop a more complete subsurface model of the rotliegend and zechstein horizons 
in the second half of  we received operating committee approval to drill the sroda prospect  a structural feature modeled on pogc s radlin field 
drilling operations resulted in a commercial well in april  with proved reserves of approximately bcf of gas 
we plan to begin sizing production facilities once we have a second successful well in the sroda area 
in september  we began drilling another well  sroda  into another structure located about km east southeast of the sroda structure 
this well was determined to be noncommercial  largely due to cementation in the top meters of the otherwise porous rotliegend sandstone 
this kind of cementation can be the result of faulting and our technical group is reviewing new seismic data to determine whether to recommend drilling a near offset to sroda we have continued to acquire new seismic each year since  with particular attention to acquisition  processing and interpretation  endeavoring to capitalize on advances developed in the rotliegend gas fields of the southern united kingdom gas basin 
we have identified several additional prospects in the sroda region  including sroda city  sroda northwest and winna gora  and anticipate drilling at least three wells in this area during we have also identified other structural features outside this area and we are continuing to work on interpretation and mapping throughout the fences ii area 
we believe the fences ii area  in general  and the sroda area  in particular  have potential for discoveries of large gas accumulations 
fences iii project area also in we acquired the fences iii project area with a interest 
during the next two years  we reprocessed and interpreted several thousand kilometers of existing seismic data covering approximately the northern third of the fences iii project area  and in january began drilling our first well  the drozdowice this well targeted a potential combination reservoir of zechstein limestone and rotliegend sandstone at a total depth of approximately meters 
upon reaching total depth  a drill stem test of the target reservoir yielded no observable hydrocarbons 
we plan to evaluate the drilling data in conjunction with existing seismic data before pursuing additional drilling in fences iii 
wilga project area in january  we announced plans to begin working with pogc to bring the wilga well into production 
the well is expected to produce at a rate of mmcf of gas and bbls of condensate per day when it begins production  which we anticipate will be in the second half of the wilga well was drilled in and as of december   had gross proved reserves of bcf and  barrels of condensate 
we are the operator of the wilga project area and own an interest 
pogc owns an interest 
during we began allocating technical resources to the wilga area in an effort to understand the two noncommercial wells that were drilled following the commercially successful wilga and to identify other potential targets in the block 
we anticipate carrying out additional technical work during exploratory activities in the united states nevada during  we drilled and abandoned three wildcat oil wells in railroad valley  nevada 
in addition  we also plugged and abandoned another well that had been drilled during late we plan to drill a small number of exploratory wells again in on land that is near our existing producing properties in nevada 
our actual cash costs to drill each well is approximately  we are able to achieve such low drilling costs due to an agreement with our partner whereby it contributes drilling equipment and we contribute all drilling labor  made up of our existing employees in montana 
item a 
risk factors risk factors our business is subject to a number of material risks  including  but not limited to  the following factors related directly and indirectly to our business activities in the united states and poland 
risks relating to our business our success depends largely on our discovery of economic quantities of oil or gas in poland 
we currently have a limited amount of production in the united states and poland 
we do not currently generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs of operation  including our exploration and general and administrative costs  and will continue to rely on funds from external sources until we generate sufficient revenue to cover these costs 
our exploration programs in poland are based on interpretations of geological and geophysical data 
the factors listed below  most of which are outside our control  may prevent us from establishing additional commercial production or substantial reserves as a result of our exploration  appraisal and development activities in poland o we cannot assure that any future well will encounter commercial quantities of oil or gas  o there is no method to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any prospect encountering oil or gas will yield oil or gas in sufficient quantities to cover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable  o one or more appraisal wells may be required to confirm the commercial potential of an oil or gas discovery  o we may continue to incur exploration costs in specific areas even if initial appraisal wells are plugged and abandoned or  if completed for production  do not result in production of commercial quantities of oil or gas  and o drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  including operating problems encountered during drilling  weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment or availability of services  and other factors 
we have limited control over our exploration and development activities in poland 
our partner  pogc  holds the majority interest and is operator of our two most important project areas and has a minority interest in a third project area 
as a paying partner  we rely to a significant extent on the financial capabilities of pogc 
if pogc were to fail to perform its obligations under contracts with us  it would most likely have a material adverse effect on us 
in particular  we have prepared our exploration budget through based on the participation of and funding to be provided by pogc 
although we have rights to participate in exploration and development activities on some pogc controlled acreage  we have limited rights to initiate such activities 
further  we have no direct interest in some of the underlying agreements  licenses and grants from the polish agencies governing the exploration  exploitation  development or production of acreage controlled by pogc 
thus  our program in poland involving pogc controlled acreage would be adversely affected if pogc should elect not to pursue activities on such acreage  if the relationship between us and pogc should deteriorate or terminate or if pogc or the governmental agencies should fail to fulfill the requirements of or elect to terminate such agreements  licenses or grants 
we cannot assure the exploration models we are using in poland will lead to finding oil or gas in poland 
we cannot assure the exploration models we and pogc have developed will provide a useful or effective guide for selecting exploration prospects and drilling targets 
we will have to revise or replace these exploration models as a guide to further exploration if ongoing drilling results do not confirm their validity 
these exploration models may be based on incomplete or unconfirmed data and theories that have not been fully tested 
the seismic data  other technologies  and the study of producing fields in the area do not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling that oil or gas will be present in commercial quantities 
we cannot assure that the analogies that we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects  or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects 
we cannot accurately predict the size of exploration targets or foresee all related risks 
notwithstanding the accumulation and study of d and d seismic data  drilling logs  production information from established fields  and other data  we cannot predict accurately the oil or gas potential of individual prospects and drilling targets or the related risks 
our predictions are only rough  preliminary geological estimates of the forecasted volume and characteristics of possible reservoirs and are not an estimate of reserves 
in some cases  our estimates may be based on a review of data from other exploration or producing fields in the area that ultimately may be found not to be similar to our exploration prospects 
we may require several test wells and long term analysis of test data and history of production to determine the oil or gas potential of individual prospects 
we have had limited exploratory success in poland 
we have participated in drilling exploratory wells in poland  including five exploratory successes the wilga  kleka  zaniemysl  sroda and rusocin  and sixteen exploratory dry holes 
of our five exploratory successes in poland  only the kleka well is currently producing 
gas production is scheduled to commence in the second half of at wilga and zaniemysl we may not achieve the results anticipated in placing our current or future discoveries into production 
we may encounter delays in commencing the production and the sale of gas in poland  including our recent gas discoveries and other possible future discoveries 
the possible delays may include obtaining rights of way to connect to the pogc pipeline system  obtaining construction permits  availability of materials and contractors  the signing of an oil or gas purchase contract  and other factors 
such delays would correspondingly delay the commencement of cash flow and may require us to obtain additional short term financing pending commencement of production 
further  we may design proposed surface and pipeline facilities based on possible estimated results of additional drilling 
we cannot assure that additional drilling will establish additional reserves or production that will provide an economic return for planned expenditures for facilities 
we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing a particular discovery into production are higher  if the project is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
privatization of pogc could affect our relationship and future opportunities in poland 
our activities in poland have benefited from our relationship with pogc  which has provided us with exploration acreage  seismic data and production data under our agreements 
the polish government commenced the privatization of pogc by selling pogc s refining assets 
in late  pogc successfully completed an initial public offering on the warsaw stock exchange  and approximately of pogc is now owned by the public and current and former employees 
privatization may result in new policies  strategies or ownership that could adversely affect our existing relationship and agreements  as well as the availability of opportunities with pogc in the future 
we have a history of operating losses and may require additional capital in the future to fund our operations 
from our inception in january through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of million 
we expect that our exploration and production activities may continue to result in net losses and that our accumulated deficit may increase 
we anticipate that we will incur losses through and possibly beyond  depending on whether our activities in poland and the united states result in sufficient revenues to cover related operating expenses 
until sufficient cash flow from operations can be obtained  we expect we will need additional capital to fully fund our ongoing planned exploration  appraisal  development and property acquisition programs in poland 
we have no current arrangement for any such additional financing  but may seek required funds from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  project financing  strategic alliances or other arrangements 
although we are currently negotiating with commercial lenders to establish a credit facility  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable or favorable terms 
obtaining additional financing may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project being financed 
we cannot assure that additional funds could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms favorable to us 
in addition to planned activities in poland  we may require additional funds for general corporate purposes 
the loss of key personnel could have an adverse impact on our operations 
we rely on our officers and key employees and consultants and their expertise  particularly david n 
pierce  president and chief executive officer  thomas b 
lovejoy  chairman and chief financial officer  andrew w 
pierce  vice president and chief operating officer  jerzy b 
maciolek  vice president of exploration  zbigniew tatys  poland country manager  and richard hardman  director and chairman of our technical committee 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals may materially and adversely affect us 
we have entered into employment agreements with our key executives 
we do not maintain key man insurance on any of our employees 
the price we receive for gas we sell will likely be lower than free market gas prices in western europe 
our limited number of wells and reserves means we cannot assure uninterruptible supply in sufficient quantities to meet the anticipated requirements of industrial users  so we currently are dependent on selling gas to pogc at prices generally lower than prevailing in western europe 
the market for the sale of gas in poland is open to competition  but there are not yet many participants 
accordingly  we expect that the prices we receive for the gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a fully competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland or until we are able to assure potential purchasers other than pogc that we have sufficient wells and reserves to assure an uninterruptible supply in sufficient quantities 
further  there is no established market relationship between gas prices in short term and long term sales agreements 
notwithstanding the strong demand for gas in poland  the availability of abundant quantities of gas from former members of the soviet union and the low cost of electricity from coal fired generating facilities may also tend to depress gas prices in poland 
oil and gas price decreases and volatility could adversely affect our operations and our ability to obtain financing 
oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors o the market and price structure in local markets  o changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  o market uncertainty  o political conditions in international oil and gas producing regions  o the extent of production and importation of oil and gas into existing or potential markets  o the level of consumer demand  o weather conditions affecting production  transportation and consumption  o the competitive position of oil or gas as a source of energy  as compared with coal  nuclear energy  hydroelectric power and other energy sources  o the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities  o the refining and processing capacity of prospective oil or gas purchasers  o the effect of governmental regulation on the production  transportation and sale of oil and gas  and o other factors beyond our control 
we have not entered into any agreements to protect us from price fluctuations and may or may not do so in the future 
our industry is subject to numerous operating risks 
insurance may not be adequate to protect us against all these risks 
our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry 
these hazards include blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage  and suspension of operations 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our domestic operations 
we cannot assure that the general liability insurance of million carried by us can continue to be obtained on reasonable terms 
pogc  as operator of the fences project area  is self insured 
we do not plan to purchase well control insurance on wells we drill in the fences project area and may elect not to purchase such insurance on wells drilled in other areas in poland as well 
the current level of insurance does not cover all of the risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling and production 
where additional insurance coverage does exist  the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full amount of such liabilities 
we may not be insured against all losses or liabilities that may arise from all hazards because such insurance is unavailable at economic rates  because of limitations on existing insurance coverage  or other factors 
for example  we do not maintain insurance against risks related to violations of environmental laws 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance 
further  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
risks relating to conducting business in poland polish laws  regulations and policies may be changed in ways that could adversely impact our business 
our oil and gas exploration  development and production activities in poland are and will continue to be subject to ongoing uncertainties and risks  including o possible changes in government personnel  the development of new administrative policies  and practices and political conditions in poland that may affect the administration of agreements with governmental agencies or enterprises  o possible changes to the laws  regulations and policies applicable to us and our partners or the oil and gas industry in poland in general  o uncertainties as to whether the laws and regulations will be applicable in any particular circumstance  o uncertainties as to whether we will be able to enforce our rights in poland  o uncertainty as to whether we will be able to demonstrate  to the satisfaction of the polish authorities  our and pogc s compliance with governmental requirements respecting exploration expenditures  results of exploration  environmental protection matters  and other factors  o the inability to recover previous payments to the polish government made under the exploration rights or any other costs incurred respecting those rights if we were to lose or cancel our exploration and exploitation rights at any time  o political instability and possible changes in government  o export and transportation tariffs  o local and national tax requirements  o expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises and other risks arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our acreage in poland  and o possible significant delays in obtaining opinions of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements in connection with a grant of permits to conduct exploration and production activities 
poland has a developing regulatory regime  regulatory policies and interpretations 
poland has a developing regulatory regime governing exploration and development  production  marketing  transportation and storage of oil and gas 
these provisions were recently promulgated and are relatively untested 
therefore  there is little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regime will affect our operations 
it is possible that such governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations  administrative practices or policies or interpretations of existing laws and regulations will materially and adversely affect our activities in poland 
for example  poland s laws  policies and procedures were changed to conform to the requirements that had to be met before poland was admitted as a full member of the european union 
our oil and gas operations are subject to rapidly changing environmental laws and regulations that could have a negative impact on our operations 
operations on our project areas are subject to environmental laws and regulations in poland that provide for restrictions and prohibitions on spills  releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and gas exploration and development 
additionally  if significant quantities of gas are produced with oil  regulations prohibiting the flaring of gas may inhibit oil production 
in such circumstances  the absence of a gas gathering and delivering system may restrict production or may require significant expenditures to develop such a system prior to producing oil and gas 
we may be required to prepare and obtain approval of environmental impact assessments by governmental authorities in poland prior to commencing oil or gas production  transportation and processing functions 
we and our partners cannot assure that we have complied with all applicable laws and regulations in drilling wells  acquiring seismic data or completing other activities in poland to date 
the polish government may adopt more restrictive regulations or administrative policies or practices 
the cost of compliance with current regulations or any changes in environmental regulations could require significant expenditures 
further  breaches of such regulations may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  any of which may be material 
these environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows in the future 
certain risks of loss arise from our need to conduct transactions in foreign currency 
the amounts in our agreements relating to our activities in poland are sometimes expressed and payable in united states dollars and sometimes in polish zlotys 
conversions between united states dollars and polish zlotys are made on the date amounts are paid or received 
in the future  our financial results and cash flows in poland may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the polish zloty and the united states dollar 
we have not hedged our foreign currency activities in the past and do not plan to do so 
currencies used by us may not be convertible at satisfactory rates 
in addition  the official conversion rates between united states and polish currencies may not accurately reflect the relative value of goods and services available or required in poland 
further  inflation may lead to the devaluation of the polish zloty 
risks related to an investment in our common stock our stockholder rights plan and bylaws discourage unsolicited takeover proposals and could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our common stock 
we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that our stockholders may consider to be in their best interests that include o provisions that members of the board of directors are elected and retire in rotation  and o the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of  and to issue new series of  preferred shares 
together  these provisions and our stockholder rights plan may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment to our stockholders of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common shares 
our common stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile 
our common stock has traded as low as and as high as during intra day trading between january   and the date of this report 
some of the factors leading to this volatility include o the outcome of individual wells or the timing of exploration efforts in poland  o the potential sale by us of newly issued common stock to raise capital or by existing stockholders of restricted securities  o price and volume fluctuations in the general securities markets that are unrelated to our results of operations  o the investment community s view of companies with assets and operations outside the united states in general and in poland in particular  o actions or announcements by pogc that may affect us  o prevailing world prices for oil and gas  o the potential of our current and planned activities in poland  and o changes in stock market analysts recommendations regarding us  other oil and gas companies or the oil and gas industry in general 
we may encounter additional exploration failures in poland that will adversely affect the trading prices for our common stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties the republic of poland the republic of poland is located in central europe  has a population of approximately million people  and covers an area comparable in size to new mexico 
during  poland peacefully asserted its independence and became a parliamentary democracy 
since  poland has enacted comprehensive economic reform programs and stabilization measures that have enabled it to form a free market economy and turn its economic ties from the east to the west  with most of its current international trade with the countries of the european union and the united states 
the economy has undergone extensive restructuring in the post communist era 
the polish government credits foreign investment as a forceful growth factor in successfully creating a stable free market economy 
since its transition to a market economy and a parliamentary democracy  poland has experienced significant economic growth and political change 
poland has developed and is refining legal  tax and regulatory systems characteristic of parliamentary democracies with interpretation and procedural safeguards 
the polish government has taken steps to harmonize polish legislation with that of the european union  which it joined in may of poland has created an attractive legal framework and fiscal regime for oil and gas exploration by actively encouraging investment by foreign companies to offset its lack of capital to further explore its oil and gas resources 
in july  poland s council of ministers approved a program to restructure and privatize the polish petroleum sector 
so far under this plan  a refinery located in plock has been privatized as a publicly held company with its stock trading on the london and warsaw stock exchanges 
in september of  pogc sold of its stock in an initial public offering on the warsaw stock exchange  raising a total of billion polish zlotys approximately us million 
pogc also issued of its stock to current and former employees 
we expect the additional funding will allow pogc to become more aggressive with the exploration spending as it pursues its stated goal of increasing gas production in country by in the next three years 
prior to becoming a parliamentary democracy during  the exploration and development of poland s oil and gas resources were hindered by a combination of foreign influence  a centrally controlled economy  limited financial resources  and a lack of modern exploration technology 
as a result  poland is currently a net energy importer 
oil is imported primarily from countries of the former soviet union and the middle east  and gas is imported primarily from russia 
polish properties legal framework general usufruct and concession terms all of our rights in poland have been awarded to us or to pogc pursuant to the geological and mining law  which specifies the process for obtaining domestic exploration and exploitation rights 
under the geological and mining law  the concession authority enters into mining usufruct lease agreements that grant the holder the exclusive right to explore for oil and gas in a designated area or to exploit the designated oil and or gas field for a specified period under prescribed terms and conditions 
the holder of the mining usufruct covering exploration must also acquire an exploration concession by applying to the concession authority and providing the opportunity for comment by local governmental authorities 
the concession authority has granted us oil and gas exploration rights on the fences iii and wilga project areas  and has granted pogc oil and gas exploration rights on the fences i and ii project areas 
the agreements divide these areas into blocks  generally containing approximately  acres each 
concessions have been acquired for exploration in all areas that lie within existing usufructs 
the exploration period begins after the date of the last concession signed under each respective usufruct 
we believe all material concession terms have been satisfied to date 
if commercially viable oil or gas is discovered  the concession owner  during the first two years of production  then applies for an exploitation concession  as provided by the usufructs  generally with a term of to years or as long as commercial production continues 
upon the grant of the exploitation concession  the concession owner may become obligated to pay a fee  to be negotiated  but expected to be less than of the market value of the estimated recoverable reserves in place 
the concession owner would also be required to pay a royalty on any production  the amount of which will be set by the council of ministers  within a range established by legislation for the mineral being extracted 
the royalty rate for high methane gas is currently less than per mcf 
this rate could be increased or decreased by the council of ministers to a rate between and per mcf the current statutory minimum and maximum royalty rates 
local governments will receive of any royalties paid on production 
the holder of the exploitation concession must also acquire rights to use the land from the surface owner and could be subject to significant delays in obtaining the consents of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements prior to obtaining an exploitation concession 
fences i project area the fences i project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession controlled by pogc 
three producing fields radlin  kleka and kaleje lie within the concession boundary  but are excluded from the fences i concession 
the concession is for a period of six years ending in september and carried certain work requirements  all of which have been completed except for the acquisition of kilometers of d seismic data 
fences ii project area the fences ii project area consists of four oil and gas exploration concessions controlled by pogc 
the concessions have expiration dates ranging from july to july remaining work commitments in the aggregate include acquiring kilometers of new d seismic data and drilling one well 
pogc is currently working on an extension for the concessions that expire in fences iii project area the fences iii project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession held by us 
several producing fields lie within the concession boundaries  but are excluded from the fences iii project area 
the concession is for a period of six years ending in december remaining work commitments include acquiring kilometers of new d seismic data or drilling one well  which has been satisfied by the drilling of the drozdowice well  and analysis and interpretation of existing well data 
beginning in the fourth year  there is a drilling requirement of a second well 
wilga block project area the wilga project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession that expires in july we are in the process of submitting a routine extension application 
all work commitments have been completed 
as of december   all required usufruct concession payments had been made for each of the above project areas 
production  transportation and marketing poland has a network of gas pipelines and crude oil pipelines traversing the country serving major metropolitan  commercial  industrial and gas production areas  including significant portions of our acreage 
poland has a well developed infrastructure of hard surfaced roads and railways over which we believe oil produced could be transported for sale 
there are refineries in gdansk and plock in poland and one in germany near the western polish border that we believe could process crude oil produced in poland 
should we choose to export any oil or gas we produce  we will be required to obtain prior governmental approval 
during early  we and pogc constructed a pipeline from the kleka well approximately four kilometers to pogc s radlin field gas processing facility and began selling gas produced to pogc at a price of per mmbtu under a five year contract that may be terminated by us with a day written notice 
as part of our restructured agreement with pogc  we agreed in to assign our interest in the kleka well  including amounts representing unpaid gas sales  to pogc to reduce our outstanding obligation to pogc  in early  we and pogc agreed that we would not convey the kleka well  subject to completing final documentation

proved reserves proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions 
our proved oil and gas reserve quantities and values are based on estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
operating costs  production taxes and development costs were deducted in determining the quantity and value information 
such costs were estimated based on current costs and were not adjusted to anticipate increases due to inflation or other factors 
no price escalations were assumed and no amounts were deducted for general overhead  depreciation  depletion and amortization  interest expense and income taxes 
the proved reserve quantity and value information is based on the weighted average price on december   of per bbl for oil in the united states and per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas in poland 
the determination of oil and gas reserves is based on estimates and is highly complex and interpretive  as there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves  projecting future rates of production and the timing and amount of development expenditures 
the estimated present value  discounted at per annum  of the future net cash flows  or pv value  was determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosure about oil and gas activities  and sec guidelines 
our proved reserve estimates are subject to continuing revisions as additional information becomes available or assumptions change 
estimates of our proved united states oil reserves were prepared by larry krause consulting  an independent engineering firm in billings  montana 
estimates of our proved polish gas reserves were prepared by rps energy  an independent engineering firm in the united kingdom

government regulation poland our activities in poland are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including the adoption of new laws  regulations or administrative policies that may adversely affect us or the terms of our exploration or production rights  political instability and changes in government or public or administrative policies  export and transportation tariffs and local and national taxes  foreign exchange and currency restrictions and fluctuations  repatriation limitations  inflation  environmental regulations  and other matters 
these operations in poland are subject to the geological and mining law dated as of september   and the protection and management of the environment act dated as of january   which are the current primary statutes governing environmental protection 
agreements with the government of poland respecting our areas create certain standards to be met regarding environmental protection 
participants in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities generally are required to adhere to good international petroleum industry practices  including practices relating to the protection of the environment  and prepare and submit geological work plans  with specific attention to environmental matters  to the appropriate agency of state geological administration for its approval prior to engaging in field operations such as seismic data acquisition  exploratory drilling and field wide development 
poland s regulatory framework respecting environmental protection is not as fully developed and detailed as that which exists in the united states 
we intend to conduct our operations in poland in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices and  as they develop  polish requirements 
we expect poland will continue to pass further legislation aimed at harmonizing polish environmental law with that of the european union 
the european union treaty of accession will require divestment by the polish government of certain portions of its oil and gas business 
changes in the industry ownership may affect the business climate where we operate 
united states state and local regulation of drilling and production our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
our oil production is affected to some degree by state regulations 
states in which we operate have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and gas  including provisions regarding deliverability 
such statutes and related regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir 
certain state regulatory authorities also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit 
environmental regulations the federal government and various state and local governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding the control of contamination of the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
these laws and regulations may also increase the costs of drilling and operation of wells 
we may also be held liable for the costs of removal and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in the federal water pollution control act  as amended by the oil pollution act of  or opa in addition  we may be subject to other civil claims arising out of any such incident 
as with any owner of property  we are also subject to clean up costs and liability for hazardous materials  asbestos or any other toxic or hazardous substance that may exist on or under any of our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
furthermore  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than our competitors in the oil and gas industry 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
furthermore  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra  however  excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development  or production of crude oil  gas or geothermal energy 
because of this exclusion  many of our operations are exempt from rcra regulation 
nevertheless  we must comply with rcra regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the rcra exclusion 
the opa and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opa establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the united states 
while opa liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water  at least one district court has held that opa liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters 
stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future  such as proposals made in congress and at the state level from time to time  that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
the impact of any such changes  however  would not likely be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated company involved in oil and gas exploration and production 
federal and indian leases a substantial part of our producing properties in montana consist of oil and gas leases issued by the bureau of land management or by the blackfeet tribe under the supervision of the bureau of indian affairs 
our activities on these properties must comply with rules and orders that regulate aspects of the oil and gas industry  including drilling and operating on leased land and the calculation and payment of royalties to the federal government or the governing indian nation 
our operations on indian lands must also comply with applicable requirements of the governing body of the tribe involved including  in some instances  the employment of tribal members 
we believe we are currently in full compliance with all material provisions of such regulations 
safety and health regulations we must also conduct our operations in accordance with various laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health 
currently  we do not foresee expending material amounts to comply with these occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
however  since such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the future effect of these laws and regulations 
title to properties we rely on sovereign ownership of exploration rights and mineral interests by the polish government in connection with our activities in poland and have not conducted and do not plan to conduct any independent title examination 
we regularly consult with our polish legal counsel when doing business in poland 
nearly all of our united states working interests are held under leases from third parties 
we typically obtain a title opinion concerning such properties prior to the commencement of drilling operations 
we have obtained such title opinions or other third party review on nearly all of our producing properties  and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all such properties sufficient to meet standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
our united states properties are subject to typical burdens  including customary royalty interests and liens for current taxes  but we have concluded that such burdens do not materially interfere with the use of such properties 
further  we believe the economic effects of such burdens have been appropriately reflected in our acquisition cost of such properties and reserve estimates 
title investigation before the acquisition of undeveloped properties is less thorough than that conducted prior to drilling  as is standard practice in the industry 
employees and consultants as of december   we had employees  consisting of nine in salt lake city  utah  in oilmont  montana  one in greenwich  connecticut  three in houston  texas  and five in poland 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
we also regularly engage technical consultants to provide specific geological  geophysical and other professional services 
our executive officers and other management employees regularly travel to poland to supervise activities conducted by our staff and others under contract on our behalf 
offices and facilities our corporate offices  located at highland drive  salt lake city  utah  contain approximately  square feet and are rented at  per month under a month to month agreement 
in montana  we own a  square foot building located at the corner of central and main in oilmont 
during  we opened a new production office in warsaw  located at ul 
chalubinskiego  where we rent a small office suite for approximately  per month

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction following is a brief discussion concerning some of the significant financial events that have occurred during the past two years 
value added tax refund throughout our operating history in poland  until october  we had been unable to obtain a refund of most of the value added taxes paid in connection with goods and services purchased input vat 
polish tax laws have restricted the refund of input vat for exploration activities to concession holders 
in our case  the polish oil and gas company  or pogc  has traditionally been the concession holder  while we are a working interest owner by virtue of our agreements with pogc 
during  poland joined the european union 
this event caused changes to several tax laws  including the law that precluded us from obtaining refunds of input vat 
in april  we filed a refund application for approximately million polish zlotys  representing all input vat paid since our inception in poland through march of the polish taxing authorities began their review of our refund application in october as part of the normal course of the review  and in order to prevent interest accruing on the refund amount  the taxing authorities deposited all million zlotys in our bank account in poland in october  equal to approximately million at then current exchange rates 
we have since received requested refunds for the months of april through june of a portion of the past input vat is related to capital costs  with the remainder attributed to current and prior years geological and geophysical costs  along with overhead and other expenses 
accordingly  we have reduced our capital costs by approximately million  current year s expenses by million  with the remaining million related to prior years expenses shown as a recovery of previously expensed input vat in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we recorded an input vat receivable at december   of million  representing input vat paid since april  and we expect to be input vat neutral from this point forward 
this means that all of our costs in poland going forward have effectively been reduced by 
fences i commitment and settlement on april   we agreed to spend million of exploration costs on the fences i project area to earn a interest 
when expenditures exceeded million  pogc would be obligated to pay its share of further costs 
in early  we entered into a settlement agreement with pogc to address the methods by which we would satisfy our then existing unpaid liability incurred in connection with meeting our spending commitment 
among other things  we agreed to assign to pogc all of our rights to prior production from the kleka well  and the liability was to be further offset by the value of the remaining gas reserves associated with the well 
accordingly  we ceased recording gas sales from the kleka well as of december  as of december   our share of the kleka well had estimated reserves of approximately million  equal to the accrued liability recorded in favor of pogc 
upon completion of the assignment of the kleka well  our previously unpaid liability was to have been settled in full 
through the end of  exclusive of the kleka well assignment  we incurred qualifying costs in excess of the commitment amount  which means that we had earned our interest  and pogc became obligated to pay its share of all qualifying project costs 
at december   we had recorded a receivable from pogc related to costs we spent in excess of our commitment requirement in the amount of  due to the fact that we exceeded our million commitment through actual cash expenditures in  we and pogc subsequently agreed that the kleka well would not be assigned to pogc  nor would pogc take credit for prior years gas sales 
in addition  during the first half of  pogc applied approximately million in unused cash call proceeds against our outstanding accrued liability 
accordingly  as of december   by virtue of the various transactions related to our fences i exploration commitment  pogc now owes us an amount equal to our prior overpayment and our share of gas sales from the kleka well from inception through the end of million and we owe pogc an amount attributable to prior costs and interest that were to have been settled against prior year gas sales from the kleka well million 
in connection with settling our accounts  we recorded a net charge of approximately  which is included in interest and other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
we expect to begin recording gas sales from the kleka well during final documentation of our fences i account is pending instructions from local tax authorities with respect to proper reporting for value added tax purposes and should be concluded in early fences ii commitment under a january agreement  we had the right to earn a interest from pogc  subject to satisfactory completion of our obligations in fences i and our expenditure of million in exploration costs in the fences ii project area 
we satisfied the expenditure requirements in late by continuing our ongoing d seismic data reprocessing  along with drilling the initial well at the sroda prospect 
we have now earned our interest  and pogc has begun paying its share of all qualifying project costs 
sales of common stock we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of  during we completed a registered offering during april of of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of  after offering costs of  in august of  we placed privately an additional  shares  resulting in net proceeds of  after offering costs of  in addition  warrant and option holders purchased a total of  shares of common stock during  providing an additional  in proceeds 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that net capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not considered to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
gains and losses are recognized on sales of entire interests in proved and unproved properties 
sales of partial interests are generally treated as a recovery of costs and any resulting gain or loss is recorded as other income 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
as of december   we had million in capitalized exploratory well costs associated with our rusocin well pending the determination of proved reserves 
oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of our oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining dd a expense and impairment expense and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas properties 
dd a rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of oil or gas produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our dd a expense 
also  estimated reserves are used to calculate future cash flows from our oil and gas operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
stock based compensation we have chosen to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
instead of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure

results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production segment  or e p  and the oilfield services segment 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation  interest income  other income  interest expense  and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
a comparison of the results of operations by business segment and the information regarding nonsegmented items for the years ended december   and  respectively  follows 
further information concerning our business segments can be found in note  business segments  in the financial statements 
exploration and production segment a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  oil production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  oil oil oil revenues    percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes per bbl    percent change versus prior year 
lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
lifting costs do not include production taxes 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
during these three years  oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices and changing production rates that are a function of normal property declines 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices and by approximately  related to higher oil production 
gas revenues 
we did not record any gas revenues during  and as part of our fences i settlement with pogc in early  we agreed to assign our interest in the kleka well effective december  along with the related accounts receivable  to pogc in order to reduce the balance of our liability due to pogc 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction fences i commitment and settlement  related to settling our fences i obligation with pogc 
we now expect to begin recording gas sales from the kleka well in lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in and million in operating costs rose from to as we took advantage of higher oil prices and revenues to work over and recomplete several wells in montana  which increased our operating costs by approximately  in addition  the higher oil revenues in resulted in higher value based production taxes of approximately  operating costs rose in from by approximately  due to higher value based production taxes and  due to higher lifting costs as the company incurred costs for new environmental compliance procedures 
exploration costs 
our exploration efforts are focused in poland  and the expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  exploratory dry holes and oil and gas leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
g g costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on acquiring  processing and interpreting new seismic data on the fences i and ii areas  including km of new d seismic shot in exploratory dry hole costs were million   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we plugged and abandoned two wells in poland  the sroda and lugi wells  for a total cost of approximately million 
in addition  we plugged and abandoned four exploratory wells in nevada for a total cost of approximately  as part of the abandonment of our pomeranian project area  we were required to plug and abandon the tuchola well in impairments of oil and gas properties were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the entire impairment related to the kleka well  which was written down to its reserve value  and included both capital costs and related pipeline costs 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to is due primarily to a reduction in oil reserves associated with higher operating costs  offset by lower production volumes 
the decrease from to is due primarily to certain wells being fully depreciated in oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the contract drilling industry picked up significantly during and continued in  resulting in increases of and respectively  in oilfield services revenues 
during  the industry was at a virtual standstill in the area where we operate 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties  and other factors 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
during  oilfield servicing costs were a higher percentage of oilfield services revenues  as compared to and  due to increased downtime and maintenance and repair costs associated with our oilfield servicing equipment 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we opened a new office in warsaw  poland  hiring five experienced individuals to assist in our exploration and production efforts 
a portion of the g a increase in is attributable to these new office costs  including salaries  taxes and benefits 
in addition  we added administrative staff in the united states  where we also experienced higher compensation related costs 
we continue to see higher legal and accounting fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and have expanded our use of consultants in our polish operations 
in  g a costs increased as we incurred higher accounting and legal fees for sarbanes oxley section compliance  higher investor relations fees as we moved from the nasdaq smallcap market to the national market  higher salaries and related payroll taxes and benefits as we enlarged our technical staff  and higher consulting fees as we increased our investor relations activities 
stock compensation g a 
stock compensation of  in represents the value of stock and options granted to non employees 
in  two of our officers exercised options to acquire a total of approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  by canceling options to purchase approximately  shares and applying the option equity to pay the exercise price on the options exercised 
the year options were due to expire during the second quarter 
in connection with this cashless exercise  we recorded a stock compensation charge of approximately million in the second quarter  which is equal to the difference between the exercise price and fair value of the options on the date of exercise  and a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
this noncash transaction had no impact on our working capital  cash flows or stockholders equity 
there we no similar transactions in or amortization of deferred compensation 
g a 
during november  we issued  restricted stock purchase rights to employees  resulting in deferred compensation of approximately million  which will be amortized ratably over the three year vesting period 
expense recognized during totaled approximately  interest and other income corporate 
interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
increases in both yearly periods are due to higher cash balances generally available for investment  coupled with rising interest rates over the two year period 
interest expense 
interest expense was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in march  we began to accrue interest on a million third party obligation at an annual rate of 
from may to september  the loan interest rate increased to 
it was reduced to from october to november  at which time the lender converted its note payable and accrued interest into common stock 
we began accruing interest on our obligation to pogc during  which accounted for interest expense of  in as part of our further restructured agreement with pogc  we stopped accruing interest on the obligation at december income taxes

sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
our cash resources and marketable securities at december   together with revenues that we expect to begin generating with gas sales in  should allow us to carry out our planned exploration program for at least the balance of without selling additional equity or farming out our properties 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future development related capital investments from strategic alliances with other energy or financial participants  the sale of additional securities  project financing  sale of partial proved or unproved property interests  or other arrangements  some of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease is due primarily to costs associated with our drilling and seismic activities during  offset to a degree by our input vat refund discussed earlier 
operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million and million in our operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses  excluding noncash charges  incurred in those years 
our current assets at year end included approximately million in refundable input vat that we expect to receive during the first six months of our current liabilities at year end included approximately million in costs related to our drilling and seismic activities in poland that were paid in early investing activities 
we received net cash from investing activities of million in  and used net cash of million and million in investing activities in and  respectively 
in we received million from the sale of marketable securities and million from the recovery of previously capitalized input vat 
we invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and  upgrading our oilfield services equipment 
in we transferred million to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we also spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and purchasing new oilfield technical software 
during  we used  to pay liabilities associated with oil and gas property additions from prior years 
in  we deposited  with calenergy gas to cover drilling expenses for the zaniemysl well  in the event costs exceeded an agreed upon target amount 
during the second quarter of  we agreed to final drilling costs for the well in an amount that enabled calenergy gas to keep the entire deposit 
accordingly  the total deposit amount was reclassified from other assets to proved property costs 
we also spent  in related to our proved properties and oilfield equipment in the united states 
financing activities 
we received net cash of million  million and million from our financing activities during  and  respectively 
all of the proceeds in were from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in we received a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of securities 
in addition  the exercise of warrants and options provided additional proceeds of million 
during  we received a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of securities 
these proceeds were offset by million paid to a third party lender  million of which was a principal payment on its note payable  and  of which was a loan extension fee paid in march we believe our current cash resources  coupled with anticipated future revenues  are sufficient to fund our exploration program through the end of contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we had no significant contractual obligations or commitments as of december   except for the drilling contract for the drozdowice well  which began drilling in january  and was plugged and abandoned in march the contract amount was million 
our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations  personal injury and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states operations and rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration participants in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
we have adopted this standard effective january   and elected the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
stock based awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 except that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r is expected to increase our salaries and benefits expense by approximately million for  based on options and other awards outstanding as of december in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for suspended well costs  which we adopted effective january  this fsp amends sfas no 
to allow continued capitalization when a the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify proceeding with the project plan  and b the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project  which may include more than one exploratory well if the reserves are intended to be extracted in a single integrated operation 
the fsp also requires increased disclosures  which are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
adoption of this rule did not impact our consolidated net loss for if this fsp had been applied to  it would not have impacted our net loss for that year 
we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future earnings or operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production in the united states is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
we currently have no gas production in poland 
previously  our gas in poland was sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing under a five year contract 
the limited volume and sources of our gas production means we cannot assure uninterruptible production or production in amounts that would be meaningful to industrial users  which may depress the price we may be able to obtain 
pogc is the primary purchaser of domestic gas in poland 
we expect that the prices we receive for the gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a more competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland 
we currently do not engage in any hedging activities to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do so if we achieve a significant amount of production in poland 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland  primarily in us dollars or the us dollar equivalent of the polish zloty 
we conduct our day to day business on this basis as well 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
we do not currently engage in hedging transactions to protect ourselves against foreign currency risks  nor do we intend to do so in the immediate future  however  we have adopted a policy to reduce currency risk by transferring dollars to zlotys on or about the occasion of making any significant commitment payable in polish currency
