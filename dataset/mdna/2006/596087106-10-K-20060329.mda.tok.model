item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion of our research and development expenses 
pulsatile product candidates we intend to develop the pulsatile drugs listed above and those in preclinical development  incorporating one or more of the following improvements once a day formulation lower dose shorter duration of therapy reduced side effect profile combination product with superior efficacy over either product alone improved pediatric dosage form currently  our drug product candidates primarily represent improved versions of approved and marketed drugs  either delivered alone or in combination with other drugs 
since these existing drugs have already been approved for marketing by the fda  we anticipate being able to rely  in part  on prior regulatory approvals and existing safety and efficacy data in seeking fda approval of our pulsatile drugs 
based on meetings with the fda regarding the study program for our amoxicillin products  we are proceeding with a study designed to meet the agency s requirements and anticipate that the study will be appropriate to support an nda approval  assuming successful clinical results 
amoxicillin pulsys amoxicillin marketed by gsk as amoxil and marketed by other companies as a generic product is a semi synthetic antibiotic that is effective for the treatment of a variety of conditions  including ear  nose and throat infections  urinary tract infections  skin infections and lower respiratory infections 
we believe the market opportunity for a once daily amoxicillin pulsys product is substantial  with more than million prescriptions written for amoxicillin formulations in ims national prescription audit  making it the most widely prescribed antibiotic drug in the united states 
in  amoxicillin had us retail sales of approximately million  on a prescription base of approximately million 
amoxicillin is generally recommended for dosing two or three times daily  for a period of ten to days 
our in vitro studies demonstrated that pulsatile dosing of amoxicillin had significantly better bacterial killing efficiency than standard regimens of amoxicillin analogous to immediate release products taken twice daily or three times daily against a resistant strain of streptococcus pneumoniae 
our amoxicillin pulsys product candidate is in a re designed phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of pharyngitis tonsillitis for adults and adolescents 
we conducted our first phase iii clinical trial for adult pharyngitis in the prior season  using a shorter duration of therapy  which failed to achieve its desired microbiological and clinical end points 
if the new clinical trial is successful and we receive fda approval  amoxicillin pulsys may be the first and only once daily amoxicillin treatment of pharyngitis tonsillitis approved in the united states 
today in the united states  the most frequently prescribed pharyngitis prescription is for mg of amoxicillin three times daily for ten days  or grams total over the course of therapy 
in addition  amoxicillin is the most commonly mentioned antibiotic associated with the pharyngitis tonsillitis diagnosis 
our amoxicillin pulsys product under evaluation in the phase iii clinical trial in adolescents and adults is dosed mg once daily for ten days  or grams total per course of therapy 
therefore  if our clinical trial results are positive and we receive 
table of contents fda approval and successfully launch the product  we would be able to dose approximately one half the amount of amoxicillin  while also providing the convenience of once daily dosing and a shorter course of therapy 
in the second quarter of  we selected amoxicillin formulations for evaluation in our phase iii program designed to support product approvals for amoxicillin pulsys for the treatment of adolescents  adults and pediatrics with pharyngitis and or tonsillitis due to group a streptococcal infections 
on october   the first patient was dosed in our phase iii study in adolescents and adults and our first patient was enrolled in our phase iii trial in pediatrics on january  our two amoxicillin pulsys phase iii clinical trials conducted in for the treatment of adolescents adults and children with strep throat failed to achieve their desired microbiological and clinical endpoints 
in june  we reported that our once daily adolescent adult amoxicillin pulsys therapy demonstrated an eradication rate of percent and in july reported that our pediatric therapy achieved a percent eradication rate 
both trials failed to achieve eradication rates that were statistically non inferior to the four times a day comparator therapy and also failed to reach the percent eradication rate necessary for fda approval as a first line therapy for strep throat 
following extensive analysis of data from our prior amoxicillin pulsys clinical trials  we decided to conduct a redesigned phase iii trial in adults and adolescents and to extend the length of treatment for our product candidate from seven days to days 
on november   advancis began enrolling patients into our new phase iii trial for our amoxicillin pulsys product candidate in adults and adolescents with strep throat 
we expect to announce top line results from the phase iii trial in adolescents and adults in the third quarter of if the trial is successful  we expect to file a b new drug application with the fda for the adult product in late or early even if our amoxicillin pulsys product candidate is approved by the fda  the earliest we could launch amoxicillin pulsys would be by the end of these forward looking statements are based on information available to us at this time 
actual results could differ because our trial results could be delayed or unsuccessful or due to delays in fda approval  which may never occur 
keflex cephalexin pulsys we are developing a once daily pulsys version of keflex  our first generation oral cephalosporin antibiotic 
our intent is to develop a once daily keflex pulsys for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections 
currently  keflex or  in its generic form  cephalexin is the antibiotic most frequently prescribed by physicians in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections 
most commonly  keflex is prescribed mg three times per day for a period of ten days 
we believe a once daily version of keflex pulsys may represent a substantial market opportunity 
in  cephalexin  the active ingredient in keflex  was the third most prescribed antibiotic in the united states  with approximately million in retail sales and over million prescriptions ims national prescription audit 
we intend to utilize the sales and marketing capabilities that we expect to develop for our keflex line of products and other potential pulsys product candidates in order to commercialize keflex pulsys 
we may determine that in order to maximize the commercial potential of keflex pulsys  it may be advantageous to enter into agreements with other pharmaceutical companies to expand the sales and marketing effort supporting the product 
pediatric pharyngitis program in  we concluded a phase iii clinical trial evaluating once daily amoxicillin pulsys in pediatric patients with pharyngitis tonsillitis strep throat which failed to achieve its desired clinical endpoints 
we believe there is potential for us to pursue a pulsatile version of amoxicillin  or another antibiotic  for the treatment of pediatric patients with strep throat through a redesigned clinical trial program 
we expect to use the results of our ongoing amoxicillin pulsys clinical trial in adolescents and adults with strep throat to assist in our evaluation of the most appropriate antibiotic product and regulatory strategy to pursue 
we have developed two amoxicillin pulsys formulations  an adult formulation presented in a tablet  and a pediatric sprinkle 
our pediatric sprinkle product utilizes a similar formulation to the adult product  however  it is dosed in multiparticulate granules designed to be sprinkled over food 
survey results from our completed pediatric 
table of contents strep throat trial suggest the convenience and transportability of our sprinkle product may be beneficial features of our sprinkle formulation 
regardless of the antibiotic selected for our pediatric pharyngitis program  we expect to utilize our sprinkle presentation as the method of dosing our product 
we believe the market opportunity for a pediatric strep throat product is substantial  as more than half of the strep throat market is believed to be represented by pediatric patients 
other possible pulsatile product candidates our current focus is on the antibiotic product candidates that include amoxicillin and keflex 
we have also identified additional product candidates which we believe could be developed for delivery in a pulsatile manner 
the timing of further development work on these candidates depends on our resources as well as our evaluation of the commercial potential of the products 
pulsys preclinical development programs advancis has identified several additional opportunities to apply pulsys technology to develop individual and combination antibiotic products which we believe could have application against the following indications sinusitis chronic bronchitis acute otitis media urinary tract infections community acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa we have conducted preclinical studies evaluating the bacterial killing efficiency of several antibiotics and antibiotic combinations dosed in a pulsatile manner 
based on these studies  along with the consultation of our scientific advisors  we believe we may be able to utilize our pulsys technology in the creation of antibiotic product candidates that target some of the most common uses of antibiotics 
these uses include sinusitis  chronic bronchitis  acute otitis media  urinary tract infections  and community acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 
we may also explore the use of our pulsatile dosing approach beyond antibiotics to other therapeutic categories  such as antivirals and antifungals 
although we have not tested the effectiveness of pulsatile dosing for these applications  we believe that our approach may yield benefits similar to those we have found for the treatment of bacterial infections 
collaboration agreements termination of our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys in may  we entered into an agreement with par pharmaceutical to collaborate in the further development and commercialization of a pulsys based amoxicillin product 
under the terms of the agreement  we conducted the development program  including the manufacture of clinical supplies and the conduct of clinical trials  and were responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the product 
we were to own the product trademark and to manufacture or arrange for supply of the product for commercial sales 
par was to be the sole distributor of the product 
both parties were to share commercialization expenses  including pre marketing costs and promotion costs  on an equal basis 
operating profits from sales of the product were also to be shared on an equal basis 
under the agreement  we received an upfront fee of million and a commitment from par to fund all further development expenses 
development expenses incurred by us were to be partially funded by quarterly payments aggregating million over the period of july through october  of which up to million is contingently refundable 

table of contents revenue related to the receipt of the quarterly payments from par was recognized based on actual costs incurred as the work was performed  limited to the minimum amounts expected to be received under the agreement and excluding amounts contingent on future events or that were contingently refundable  with the balance of cash received in excess of revenue recognized recorded as deferred revenue 
the excess of the development costs incurred by us over the quarterly payments made by par was to be funded subsequent to commercialization  by the distribution to us of par s share of operating profits until the excess amount had been reimbursed 
we did not record any amounts as revenue on a current basis that were dependent on achievement of future operating profits 
on august   we were notified by par of its decision to terminate the amoxicillin pulsys collaboration agreement 
we received from par the million development funding quarterly payment due in july and expect no further payments under the collaboration 
under certain circumstances  the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle par to receive a share of net profits up to one half of their million funding of the development of certain amoxicillin pulsys products  should a product covered by the agreement be successfully commercialized 
accordingly  in the third quarter we retained deferred revenue of million related to the agreement  and accelerated the recognition into current revenue of the remaining balance of million of deferred reimbursement revenue 
revenue related to the million upfront fee was being amortized into contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated development period 
as a result of the termination  we recognized the remaining deferred revenue balance of million related to the upfront fee as revenue in the third quarter of termination of the collaboration with glaxosmithkline in july  we entered into a license agreement with glaxosmithkline gsk pursuant to which we licensed patents and pulsys technology to gsk for use with its augmentin amoxicillin clavulanate combination products and with limited other amoxicillin products 
under the agreement  gsk was responsible  at its cost and expense  to use commercially reasonable efforts for the clinical development  manufacture and sale of the licensed products 
we received an initial non refundable payment of million from gsk upon signing of the agreement  a million payment upon achievement of the first milestone  and would have been entitled to receive additional milestone payments from gsk not to exceed an aggregate of million if it achieved certain product development goals 
in addition  we were eligible to receive royalty payments on the commercial sale of products developed under the agreement 
we could have also received sales milestone payments of up to million if specified annual sales goals were achieved 
the agreement could be terminated at any time by gsk upon relatively short notice 
our receipt of milestone payments  royalty payments and sales milestone payments under the agreement depended on the ability of gsk to develop and commercialize the products covered by the agreement and was subject to certain conditions and limitations 
on october   we were notified that gsk would terminate the collaboration  effective december  as a result of the termination  we accelerated the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue of approximately million related to the collaboration during the fourth quarter of the termination will have no other effects on our financial position 
collaboration with par pharmaceutical for generic clarithromycin in september  we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we licensed to par pharmaceutical the distribution and marketing rights to our generic formulation of abbott s biaxin xl extended release clarithromycin 
during the third quarter of  we conducted bioequivalence studies on two revised formulations of the generic product  with both formulations failing to achieve bioequivalence 
we concluded that due to the non core nature of the product  the expense involved in the development of additional formulations  the continued redirection of our resources required to pursue the product  and the reduced market potential given the emergence of competing products  we would discontinue further development work on the product 
sales and marketing we currently have a small sales and marketing staff supporting the sale of the keflex brand of cephalexin to national accounts 
keflex is primarily sold directly to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in the pharmaceutical industry 
table of contents there are a limited number of major wholesalers responsible for the majority of sales 
product sales of keflex to cardinal health inc  mckesson corporation  and amerisourcebergen corporation represented approximately percent of our net revenue from keflex in we are currently developing expanded commercialization plans for our keflex line of products and could leverage that capability should we be successful in gaining marketing approval for amoxicillin pulsys 
for both keflex and amoxicillin pulsys  we expect to target high volume prescribers with a community based sales force 
we intend to build our internal sales capability to enable us to sell and market keflex and our proprietary pulsys products in concentrated markets 
we expect to also use a contract sales organization to supplement our internal capabilities  especially during the early stages of our sales force development 
in february  we entered into marketing agreements with third parties to assist in the sales and marketing of our anticipated new keflex line extension products 
we filed a supplemental new drug application snda with the fda for the new products in december  and expect to receive action on the application in april should we receive approval in april  we believe we would then be in a position to hire internal sales managers  contract with third party contract sales organizations  and then launch our new keflex products in the second half of we expect to hire up to as many as eight internal divisional sales managers and to sign agreements with contract sales organizations whereby we would be directing the selling efforts of approximately to sales representatives who would be dedicated to the promotion of our new keflex line extension products 
final hiring decisions and contract sales agreements are expected to be completed only upon the approval of the new keflex products 
we believe that a significant percentage of prescriptions for first line  broad spectrum antibiotics is written by high volume prescribers who can be reached by a community based sales force 
over time  we intend to expand our sales and marketing capabilities to provide even greater support of our target audience 
we may also enter into agreements with other parties to capitalize on their sales and marketing capabilities in order to optimally market our products 
we currently manage the distribution of keflex  including warehousing and shipping  through integrated commercialization solutions  a division of amerisourcebergen corporation 
if we successfully develop and receive regulatory approval for additional product candidates  we intend to continue to distribute all approved products through third party vendors 
if we successfully develop and receive regulatory approval to market additional product candidates  we believe we will have to substantially expand our sales and marketing capabilities and or enter into partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we will need to successfully recruit sales and marketing personnel and build a sales and marketing infrastructure to successfully commercialize amoxicillin pulsys and any additional products or product candidates that we develop  acquire or license 
our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to develop additional sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize our future products to our target audiences 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by a number of established  large pharmaceutical companies  as well as smaller emerging companies 
our main competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as pfizer  glaxosmithkline  wyeth  bristol myers squibb  merck  johnson johnson  roche  schering plough  novartis  sanofi aventis  abbott laboratories  astrazeneca  and bayer  that may develop new drug compounds that render our drugs obsolete or noncompetitive 
smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies engaged in focused research and development of anti infective drugs  such as trimeris  vertex  gilead sciences  cubist  basilea  intermune  king  and others 
drug delivery companies  such as johnson johnson s alza division  biovail and skyepharma  which may develop a dosing regimen that is more effective than pulsatile dosing 

table of contents generic drug companies  such as teva  ranbaxy  ivax  sandoz and stada  which produce low cost versions of antibiotics that may contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our pulsys product candidates 
there are many approved antibiotics available to treat bacterial conditions in the united states 
our product keflex  and products that are in development  will compete with other available products based primarily on efficacy safety tolerability acceptance by doctors patient compliance and acceptance patent protection convenience price insurance and other reimbursement coverage distribution marketing adaptability to various modes of dosing our keflex brand of cephalexin faces significant competition from generic distributors of cephalexin capsules and suspension 
currently  a significant portion of the prescriptions written for keflex are substituted at the pharmacy with generic versions of keflex  supplied through leading generic drug manufacturers including teva  stada  ivax  ranbaxy  and others 
in some instances our novel products that utilize our pulsys technology may compete against non pulsatile drug products that share the same active ingredient  but are less convenient or require more cumbersome administration schedules 
a number of these non pulsatile drug products are available in generic form  which are usually substantially less expensive than the branded version 
companies such as teva  ranbaxy  ivax  sandoz and stada  and others are major manufacturers and distributors of generic versions of antibiotics with whom we may compete in the future 
new developments  including the development of methods of preventing the incidence of disease  such as vaccines  occur rapidly in the pharmaceutical industry 
these developments may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of our competitors possess greater financial  managerial and technical resources and have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing drugs  all of which put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our competitors may be able to apply their resources and capabilities to develop and commercialize products that have distinct  enhanced  or perceived advantages versus our products 
the competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources in the sales  marketing  and distribution of these products and therefore considerably impact our ability to successfully commercialize our own products 
manufacturing we currently rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we believe that our initial focus on the production of improved formulations of approved and marketed drugs will reduce the risk and time involved in the development of manufacturing capabilities because production of these drugs involves well established and well accepted manufacturing techniques and processes 
we intend to continue to rely upon third party contract manufacturers for production of our clinical and commercial supplies 
the use of third parties for these activities allows us to 
table of contents minimize our initial capital investment and reduce the risk that would be associated with the establishment of our own commercial manufacturing and distribution operations 
with the possible transition to non beta lactam products  we anticipate that our pilot facility could satisfy our drug production needs for clinical supplies through at least phase ii and  in some cases  through phase iii clinical trials 
in december  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with ceph international corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of patheon s mova pharmaceutical corporation  to secure a long term supply for our keflex brand of products 
this agreement provides for commercial supply of our keflex product beyond the transitional period agreed to by eli lilly as part of our june acquisition 
in april  we entered into agreements under which stada production ireland limited spi  previously known as the manufacturing division of clonmel healthcare limited  a subsidiary of stada arzneimittel ag  will provide us with commercial supply of our amoxicillin pulsys products currently being evaluated in our phase iii clinical trial 
under the agreements  we secured supply for the commercial phase of our amoxicillin pulsys products pending the successful completion of clinical trials and regulatory approval 
spi has capacity in place to cover current projected needs for an initial commercial phase  with additional capacity for growth 
in addition to commercial supply  advancis and spi have also finalized an agreement for technology transfer  clinical stability batches and commercial scale up and validation  as well as an agreement covering advancis funded facility build out and equipment additions to support the commercial manufacturing program 
in connection with our manufacturing activities  we generate hazardous waste 
we are subject to federal and state regulation regarding the disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous waste 
we may incur costs to comply with such regulations now or in the future 
patent and intellectual property protection our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
further  all of our employees have executed agreements assigning to us all rights to any inventions and processes they develop while they are employed by us 
in addition  we intend to use license agreements to access external products and technologies  as well as to convey our own intellectual property to others 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
protection of our intellectual property rights is subject to a number of risks 
we currently own issued us patents and us patent applications 
our issued patents cover certain compositions and methods using pulsatile dosing 
we also own foreign filed patent applications  which correspond to our us patents and applications 
we also own three international pct patent applications  each of which international pct patent applications we anticipate converting into several individually foreign filed patent applications to further correspond to our us patents and applications 
government regulation we are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation by the fda  including regulations that govern the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  and promotion of drugs under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health services act  and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
fda approval is required before any dosage form of any new drug  a generic equivalent of a previously approved drug  or a new combination of previously approved drugs  can be marketed in the united states 
all applications for fda approval must contain information relating to pharmaceutical formulation  stability  manufacturing  processing  packaging  labeling and quality control 

table of contents new drug application process the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing 
submission of an investigational new drug application ind which must become effective before the commencement of clinical trials 
performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product s intended use 
submission to and approval by the fda of a new drug application nda 
preclinical preclinical studies generally include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as animal studies  to assess the safety and efficacy of the product 
preclinical trials also provide a basis for design of human clinical studies 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap phase i during phase i studies  the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase ii during phase ii studies  the drug is introduced to patients that have the medical condition that the drug is intended to treat 
phase ii studies are intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage 
phase ii studies may often be combined with phase i studies referred to as phase i ii studies in certain instances when safety issues and questions of absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion are well established 
phase iii when phase ii evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile  phase iii trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage  clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population  often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
the drug sponsor  the fda or the institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a concern that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of product development  preclinical animal studies and human studies are submitted to the fda as part of the nda 
the nda also must contain extensive manufacturing information 
the fda may approve or disapprove the nda if applicable fda regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional clinical data to continue to evaluate the nda 
in our nda submissions  we intend to rely  in part  on prior fda approvals of the antibiotic ingredients used in our products and on data generated by other parties which help to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of those ingredients 
in the case of products that we may develop in conjunction with sponsors of previously approved products  we expect that we will have a specific right of reference to the data contained in the prior applications 
in any case in which we do not have a specific right of reference from the sponsor of the previously approved product  we anticipate our nda submissions would be covered by section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
all data necessary to satisfy the fda of the safety and effectiveness of our own versions of these products will have to be generated by or for us and submitted to the fda in support of our applications 
these data are expected to include data establishing the safety and efficacy of the pulsatile dosage form and any other differences between the dosage form and the conditions for use of our products and the dosage form and conditions for use of the previously approved products 
in the case of antibiotic ingredients not previously approved to be manufactured and sold in the combinations that we propose  it will also be necessary for us to satisfy the fda s combination drug policy with data establishing that each active component contributes to the effectiveness of the combination and that the dosage of each component is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy 
in its review of our nda submissions  the fda will have broad discretion to require us to generate data on these matters  and it is impossible to predict the number or nature of the studies that may be 
table of contents required before the agency will grant an approval 
no assurance can be given that ndas submitted for our products will receive fda approval on a timely basis  or at all 
in addition to the need to submit new clinical data and other information sufficient to support the approval of our nda submissions  under certain circumstances there are additional procedures that may need to be followed  and limitations that may apply  to the submission or approval of a nda covered by section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
however  these procedures and limitations will not apply to the products in our development pipeline which contain active ingredients that are classified by fda as antibiotics and that were the subject of approval applications submitted to fda prior to november  the only active ingredients which are being considered in our current development projects which do not fall within this exempt antibiotic category are metronidazole  and fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin 
of these  at the present time  we do not believe that the applicable limitations will have any effect on our metronidazole development projects 
with respect to products containing fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin  in the absence of a licensing agreement  any application for approval that we submit to fda may need to include statutorily required certifications regarding our non infringement of certain patents covering previously approved products  we may be required to notify the original nda holder and patent holder of those filings  and we may be subject to approval delays of up to months  or longer  in the event that the patent holder brings suit against us for patent infringement within days of such notifications 
for all of the products that we have in development that contain antibiotic ingredients that were submitted to the fda for approval prior to november   we will not  under current law  be able to submit to the fda patent information covering those products 
therefore  once approved  the fda s orange book  which lists patent information on drug products  will not include patent information on those products 
as a consequence  potential competitors who submit b or anda applications for generic versions of those products will not have to provide certifications regarding any of our patents that they may infringe or to provide us notice if they intend to market their products prior to expiration of those patents 
additionally  if we bring a patent infringement action against any such applicants  there will be no automatic month stay of approval of those potentially infringing products 
however  we would be entitled to pursue traditional patent law procedures and remedies  such as preliminary and permanent injunctions 
in the case of potential generic versions of any of our products that are not classified as exempt antibiotics  such as those containing only metronidazole or fluoroquinolone ingredients such as ciprofloxacin  we would be entitled to list our applicable patents in the orange book  potential competitors who submit b or anda applications for generic version of those products would be subject to the certification and notice requirements  and there could be automatic month stays of approval of the generic products while we pursue patent infringement actions against the applicants 
under the prescription drug user fee act pdufa generally  the submission of an nda is subject to substantial application user fees  currently exceeding  and the manufacturer and or sponsor under an approved nda are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees  currently exceeding  per product and  per establishment 
these fees are typically increased annually 
because our products in development contain only active ingredients that have been previously approved in other applications for the same usage indications we intend to seek approval for  we do not believe that we should be subject to any of these user fees 
however  fda has adopted a broad interpretation of the scope of the user fee requirements and  even if we disagree with the legal basis for that interpretation  we may be required to pay these fees with respect to some or all of our products unless and until fda s interpretation is successfully challenged 
nevertheless  we believe that the first nda submission for our pulsatile drug products may be eligible for a waiver of the application fee because of our status as a small business under the user fee statutes 
in addition  the pdufa statute has been subject to significant amendments in connection with its regular reauthorization 
we are not in a position to predict whether and how the user fee requirements will be interpreted and applied to us and our products in the future 
other regulatory constraints in addition to the results of product development  preclinical animal studies and clinical human studies  an nda also must contain extensive information on the chemistry  manufacturing and controls that relate to the planned routine production and testing of the drug 
an nda must also contain proposed prescribing information for the product  supported by available clinical and other testing data  describing how the product may properly be used 

table of contents the fda may approve  deny approval or grant conditional approval depending on whether it finds that information provided sufficiently addresses all issues regarding the manufacture and proposed use of the product candidate 
both prior to and subsequent to approval  the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and fda regulations require that the manufacture and testing of any drug for investigational use or for commercial use in humans be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice cgmp 
failure to follow cgmp requirements  as well as other regulatory requirements  can subject a sponsor and its products to various sanctions  including civil and criminal penalties  injunctions against the distribution of products and seizure of violative products 
cgmp requirements are complex  are not always clearly defined  and can evolve over time 
we have used  and intend to continue to use  firms to manufacture and test our product candidates which we believe are knowledgeable and qualified in compliance with cgmp requirements and  to the extent that we engage in these activities on our own behalf  intend to utilize cgmp compliant procedures and controls 
there can be no assurance  however  that we or our contractors will be and remain at all times in full compliance with all cgmp requirements 
in addition  the fda retains authority to object to promotional activities engaged in by the applicant  including promotional activities that exceed the scope of approved prescribing information 
under certain circumstances  the fda may also impose post marketing testing requirements and may propose to withdraw or suspend approval of products based on new information about their safety and effectiveness for their approved uses 
foreign regulatory approval outside the united states  our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all the risks associated with fda approval described above 
the requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
we plan to choose the european regulatory filing procedure that we believe will allow us to obtain regulatory approvals quickly 
however  the chosen regulatory strategy may not secure regulatory approvals or approvals of the chosen product indications 
in addition  these approvals  if obtained  may take longer than anticipated 
we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
employees as of february   we had employees  of whom are senior management  are in supervisory positions and are non management 
of the employees  perform scientific and research activities and hold advanced degrees 
item a 
risk factors there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are indicated by forward looking statements 
those factors include  without limitation  those listed below and elsewhere herein 
risks related to our business we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
from the date we began operations in january through december   we have incurred operating losses of approximately million  including operating losses of approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for 
table of contents the fiscal year ended december  our losses to date have resulted principally from research and development costs related to the development of our product candidates  the purchase of equipment and establishment of our facilities and general and administrative costs related to our operations 
we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of increases in our research and development costs  including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials  and regulatory compliance activities 
our chances for achieving profitability will depend on numerous factors  including success in developing and testing product candidates  achieving milestones under our collaboration agreements  receiving regulatory approvals  developing proprietary antibiotic products  commercializing our products  and establishing our competitive position 
many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will ever become profitable 
substantially all of our product candidates are based on a finding that could ultimately prove to be incorrect  or could have limited applicability 
substantially all of our product candidates are based on our finding that bacteria exposed to antibiotics in front loaded  rapid sequential bursts are eliminated more efficiently and effectively than those exposed to presently available treatment regimens 
ultimately  our finding may be incorrect  in which case our pulsatile drugs would not differ substantially from competing drugs and may be inferior to them 
if these products are substantially identical or inferior to products already available  the market for our pulsatile drugs will be reduced or eliminated 
even if pulsatile dosing is more effective than traditional dosing  we may be unable to apply this finding successfully to a substantial number of products in the anti infective market 
our preliminary studies indicate that pulsatile dosing may not provide superior performance for all types of antibiotics 
additionally  we have not conducted any studies with anti viral or anti fungal medications 
if we cannot apply our technology to a wide variety of antibiotics or other anti infectives  our potential market will be substantially reduced 
our delivery technology may not be effective  which would prevent us from commercializing products that are more effective than those of our competitors 
even if we are correct that pulsatile dosing is more effective than traditional dosing of antibiotics  our delivery technology must be effective in humans such that the pulsatile administration of drugs are at levels that prove effective in curing infections 
if our pulsys delivery technology is not effective in delivering rapid bursts of antibiotics  or is unable to do so at an appropriate concentration and we are not able to create an alternative delivery method for pulsatile dosing that proves to be effective  we will be unable to capitalize on any advantage of our discovery 
should this occur  our pulsatile product candidates may not be more effective than those of our competitors  which may decrease or eliminate market acceptance of our products 
if a competitor produces and commercializes an antibiotic that is superior to our pulsatile antibiotics  the market for our potential products would be reduced or eliminated 
we have devoted a substantial amount of our research efforts and capital to the development of pulsatile antibiotics 
competitors are developing or have developed new drugs that may compete with our pulsatile antibiotics 
for example  sanofi aventis recently launched ketek  a drug that belongs to a new class of antibiotics known as ketolides 
this antibiotic may compete against our pulsatile antibiotics in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections 
a number of pharmaceutical companies are also developing new classes of compounds  
table of contents such as oxazolidinones  that may also compete against our pulsatile antibiotics 
in addition  other companies are developing technologies to enhance the efficacy of antibiotics by adding new chemical entities that inhibit bacterial metabolic function 
if a competitor produces and commercializes an antibiotic or method of delivery of antibiotics that provides superior safety  effectiveness or other significant advantages over our pulsatile antibiotics  the value of our pulsatile drugs would be substantially reduced 
as a result  we would need to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets  which would be costly and time consuming 
in the event we are unable to establish new product targets  we will be unable to generate sources of revenue 
we have not commissioned an extensive third party patent infringement  invalidity and enforceability investigation on pulsatile dosing and we are aware of one issued patent covering pulsatile delivery 
our patents  prior art and infringement investigations were primarily conducted by our senior management and other employees 
although our patent counsel has consulted with management in connection with management s intellectual property investigations  our patent counsel has not undertaken an extensive independent analysis to determine whether our pulsatile technology infringes upon any issued patents or whether our issued patents or patent applications covering pulsatile dosing could be invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason 
we are aware of one issued patent owned by a third party that covers certain aspects of delivering drugs by use of two delayed release pulses 
the patent covers a drug delivery system employing two delayed release pulses using two polymers 
the claims made by this patent could be argued to cover certain aspects of our technology 
however  we believe that we will be able to manufacture and market formulations of our pulsatile products without infringing any valid claims under this patent 
any reformulation of our products  if required  could be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
we cannot assure you that a claim will not be asserted by such patent holder or any other holder of an issued patent that any of our products infringe their patent or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we cannot assure you that  in the event of litigation  any claims would be resolved in our favor 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  may result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources  divert the attention of management and harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could result in substantial damages and force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign our products  which would be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
we have not sought patent protection for certain aspects of our technology 
we have not filed for patent protection with respect to specific formulations  materials including inactive ingredients or manufacturing process approaches that are incorporated in our individual pulsatile antibiotic products  and we may not seek such patent coverage in the future 
in producing our pulsatile antibiotics  we expect to use general formulation techniques used in the industry that would be modified by us and which would  therefore  include know how and trade secrets that we have developed 
we cannot be certain that a patent would issue to cover such intellectual property and currently  we would prefer to keep such techniques and know how as our trade secrets 
in the event a competitor is able to develop technology substantially similar to ours and patent that approach  we may be blocked from using certain of our formulations or manufacturing process approaches  which could limit our ability to develop and commercialize products 
if we are unable to develop and successfully commercialize our product candidates  we may never achieve profitability 
we have not commercialized any pulsatile products or recognized any revenue from pulsys product sales 
with the exception of our amoxicillin pulsys product  all of our pulsatile drugs are in early stages of development with a total of only four pulsatile product candidates having been tested in phase i ii clinical trials 
table of contents to date 
our amoxicillin pulsys product is currently in a phase iii clinical trial  however  we must successfully complete this phase iii clinical trial and obtain regulatory approval for our pulsatile products before we are able to commercialize pulsatile products and generate revenue from their sales 
we expect that we must conduct significant additional research and development activities on our other pulsatile products successfully completing preclinical  phase i  phase i ii or phase ii  and phase iii clinical trials before we will be able to receive final regulatory approval to commercialize these pulsatile products 
even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our pulsatile drugs  we may never generate sufficient or sustainable revenue to enable us to be profitable 
if we do not successfully attract and retain collaborative partners  or our partners do not satisfy their obligations  we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates 
for certain product candidates  we intend to enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties 
these collaborations may be necessary in order for us to fund our research and development activities  fund manufacturing by third parties  seek and obtain regulatory approvals  and successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us  or at all  and any future agreement may expose us to risks that our partner might fail to fulfill its obligations and delay commercialization of our products 
we also could become involved in disputes with partners  which could lead to delays in or terminations of our development and commercialization programs and time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration 
our inability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other partners  or our failure to maintain such arrangements  would limit the number of product candidates which we could develop and ultimately  decrease our sources of any future revenues 
if we cannot enter into new licensing arrangements or otherwise gain access to products  our ability to develop a diverse product portfolio could be limited 
a component of our business strategy is in licensing or acquiring drug compounds developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories that may be marketed and developed or improved upon using our novel technologies 
competition for promising compounds can be intense and currently we have not entered into any arrangement to license or acquire any drugs from other companies 
if we are not able to identify licensing or acquisition opportunities or enter into arrangements on acceptable terms  we will be unable to develop a diverse portfolio of products 
any product candidate that we acquire will require additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive preclinical and or clinical testing and approval by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any approved products that we develop or acquire will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  widely accepted in the marketplace or that we will be able to recover our significant expenditures in connection with the development or acquisition of such products 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  sales and marketing resources  may compete with us for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
in addition  if we acquire product candidates from third parties  we will be dependent on third parties to supply such products to us for sale 
we could be materially adversely affected by the failure or inability of such suppliers to meet performance  reliability and quality standards 

table of contents our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success depends on our ability to retain them 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our scientific and management teams  especially edward m 
rudnic  our president and chief executive officer 
in order to pursue our product development  marketing and commercialization plans  we may need to hire additional personnel with experience in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  marketing and business development 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
we are not aware of any present intention of any of our key personnel to leave our company or to retire 
however  although we have employment agreements with our executive officers  these employees may terminate their services upon days advance notice 
the loss of any of our key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel  may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research  development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we maintain key man life insurance on dr 
rudnic  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the costs of the loss of his services and the expense of recruiting and hiring a new president and chief executive officer 
our ability to complete clinical trials and ultimately commercialize products will be delayed if we are unable to obtain sufficient apis or finished products from certain suppliers 
we obtain active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and finished products from certain specialized manufacturers for use in clinical studies that we intend to conduct without assistance from collaborative partners 
although the antibiotics and finished products we use in our clinical studies may be obtained from several suppliers  our applications for regulatory approval may authorize only one supplier as our source 
in the event an authorized supplier in an application for regulatory approval loses its regulatory status as an acceptable source or otherwise becomes unable or unwilling to supply the api or finished products to us at a commercially reasonable price  we would need to locate another source 
a change to a supplier not previously approved in our application for regulatory approval or an alteration in the procedures or product provided to us by an approved supplier may require formal approval by the us food and drug administration fda before we could use the api in the production of commercial supplies for our products or use the finished product for commercialization 
these factors could result in delays in conducting or completing our clinical trials and delay our ability to commercialize products 
clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed due to our dependence on third parties for the conduct of such trials 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing clinical trials 
we rely  and will continue to rely  on third parties  including clinical research organizations and outside consultants  to assist us in managing and monitoring clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties may result in delays in completion of  or the failure to complete  these trials if they fail to perform their obligations under our agreements 
if clinical trials for our products are unsuccessful or delayed  we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines 
we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans before we can obtain regulatory approvals for their commercial sale 
in addition  we will also need to demonstrate through clinical trials any claims we may wish to make that our product candidates are comparable or superior to existing products 
for drug products which are expected to contain active ingredients in fixed combinations that have not been previously approved by the fda  clinical studies may also need to be conducted in order to establish the contribution of each active component to the effectiveness of the combination in an appropriately identified patient population 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
currently  we have one amoxicillin pulsys product in a phase iii clinical trial for adults and adolescents 
we expect to have results from the adults and adolescents trial in the third quarter of for our other products we have not completed preclinical studies and initial clinical trials phase i  phase i ii or phase ii to extrapolate proper dosage for phase iii clinical 
table of contents efficacy trials in humans 
in the event we incorrectly identify a dosage as appropriate for human clinical trials  any results we receive from such trials may not properly reflect the optimal efficacy or safety of our products and may not support approval in the absence of additional clinical trials using a different dosage 
the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors  including lack of efficacy during the clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  or government or regulatory delays 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials are often not predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
although a new product may show promising results in preclinical and initial clinical trials  it may subsequently prove unfeasible or impossible to generate sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies are susceptible to varying interpretations  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors  including results that do not support our claims  perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in  or termination of  our clinical trials or a determination by the fda that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval 
we will need additional capital in the future 
if additional capital is not available  we may be forced to delay or curtail the development of our product candidates 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources and expected product sales will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next months 
we may need additional capital to fund our operations beyond our requirements for additional capital could be substantial and will depend on many other factors  including payments received under future collaborative partner agreements  continued progress of research and development of our pulsatile drugs  our ability to acquire or license drugs from others for use with pulsys  costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights  development of sales and marketing capabilities  and market acceptance of our products 
we have no significant committed sources of additional capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  if we obtain debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  thus limiting funds available for our business activities 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly our development and commercialization activities 
we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards if product liability claims that may be brought against us are successful 
the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials  and the sale of any approved products  may expose us to liability claims and financial losses resulting from the use or sale of our products 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials  which we believe is adequate to cover our present 
table of contents activities 
however  such insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims made against us 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses 
if our pulsys products are not accepted by the market  our revenues and profitability will suffer 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our pulsys products  our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness  potential advantages over alternative therapies  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and effectiveness of our marketing and distribution capabilities and the effectiveness of such capabilities of our collaborative partners 
our product candidates  if successfully developed  will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs 
our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others 
physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and use any product candidates that we or our collaborative partners develop 
to the extent current antibiotics already successfully treat certain infections  physicians may not be inclined to prescribe our pulsatile drugs for the same indications 
if our products do not achieve significant market acceptance  we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
because we depend on a single manufacturer for keflex  we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these products at commercially acceptable rates 
we obtained our keflex products from eli lilly under a manufacturing agreement that expired in december we have transitioned the manufacturing of our keflex products to ceph international corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of patheon s mova pharmaceutical corporation 
although we believe that the api and finished products for keflex could be obtained from several suppliers  our applications for regulatory approval currently authorize only ceph as our source 
in the event that ceph is unable to supply the products to us at a commercially reasonable price or breaches its agreement with us  or if ceph loses its regulatory status as an acceptable source  we would need to locate another source 
a change to a supplier not previously approved or an alteration in the procedures or product provided to us by an approved supplier may require formal approval by the fda before the product could be sold 
these factors could limit our ability to sell keflex and would materially adversely affect our revenues 
we rely upon a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors  which could impact our ability to sell our keflex product 
we rely largely upon specialty pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers to deliver keflex to end users  including physicians  hospitals  and pharmacies 
there can be no assurance that these distributors and wholesalers will adequately fulfill the market demand for keflex  nor can there be any guarantee that these service providers will remain solvent 
given the high concentration of sales to certain pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers  we could experience a significant loss if one of our top customers were to declare bankruptcy or otherwise become unable to pay its obligations to us 
we are subject to therapeutic equivalent substitution  medicaid reimbursement and price reporting 
the cost of pharmaceutical products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies  legislative bodies and private organizations in the us and other countries 
in the us  most states have enacted legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a generic equivalent to the 
table of contents prescribed drug 
federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay to state medicaid agencies prescribed rebates on drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under medicaid programs 
federal and state governments continue to pursue efforts to reduce spending in medicaid programs  including restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for certain products 
in addition  some states are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by federal law  and there are federal legislative proposals to expand current medicaid rebates 
we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of keflex by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
our ability to earn sufficient returns on keflex depends  in part  on the availability of reimbursements from third party payers  such as health insurers  governmental health administration authorities and other organizations and the amount of rebates payable under medicaid programs 
our ability to conduct clinical trials will be impaired if we fail to qualify our clinical supply manufacturing facility and we are unable to maintain relationships with current clinical supply manufacturers or enter into relationships with new manufacturers 
we currently rely on several contractors to manufacture product samples for our clinical studies 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed construction of a manufacturing facility for production of clinical supplies sufficient for use through our phase ii and  in some cases  phase iii clinical trials 
we expect this facility to be qualified and operational in the future 
we have no experience qualifying manufacturing facilities and we may not be able to qualify the facility 
if we are unsuccessful in qualifying our own manufacturing facility and fail to maintain our relationships with our current clinical supply manufacturers or enter into relationships with new manufacturers  we will be unable to conduct our clinical trials effectively 
we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture products that we intend to sell through our own commercialization and sales efforts 
we believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may retain to produce these products 
however  once we retain a manufacturing source  if we are unable to maintain our relationship with such manufacturer  qualifying a new manufacturing source will be time consuming and expensive  and may cause delays in the development of our products 
if we fail to establish sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities  or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties  we will not be able to commercialize our products 
we have limited sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize any product candidates that receive final regulatory approval  we must considerably expand our commercial capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us 
in order to market any of our product candidates directly  we must considerably expand our commercial infrastructure  including distribution  marketing  and sales personnel 
the expansion or contracting of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources  which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts 
to the extent that we enter into sales and marketing arrangements with other companies  our revenues will depend on the efforts of others 
these efforts may not be successful 
if we fail to expand sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties  we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs 
risks related to our industry any inability to protect our intellectual property could harm our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies and products in the us and other countries 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate our competitive advantage 
further  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these foreign countries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including our patent positions  involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents may be challenged  deemed unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented 
we will be able to protect our 
table of contents proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we cover our proprietary technologies with valid and enforceable patents or we effectively maintain such proprietary technologies as trade secrets 
we will apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates as we deem appropriate 
we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion  or at all  and in any event  the applications we do file may be challenged and may not result in issued patents 
any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
in addition  if challenged  our patents may be declared invalid 
even if valid  our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages 
we rely upon trade secrets protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
we have taken measures to protect our proprietary information  however  these measures may not provide adequate protection 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
if we do not compete successfully in the development and commercialization of products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to capture and sustain a meaningful market position 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
while we are not aware of any company using rapid bursts of antibiotics as a treatment method  there are numerous companies actively engaged in the research and development of anti infectives 
our main competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as pfizer  glaxosmithkline  wyeth  bristol myers squibb  merck  johnson johnson  roche  schering plough  novartis  sanofi aventis  abbott laboratories  astrazeneca  and bayer  that may develop new drug compounds that render our drugs obsolete or noncompetitive 
smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies engaged in focused research and development of anti infective drugs  such as trimeris  vertex  gilead sciences  cubist  basilea  intermune  king  and others 
drug delivery companies  such as johnson johnson s alza division  biovail and skyepharma  which may develop a dosing regimen that is more effective than pulsatile dosing 
generic drug companies  such as teva  ranbaxy  ivax  sandoz and stada  which produce low cost versions of antibiotics that may contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our pulsys product candidates 
many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining approvals of products from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and manufacturing and marketing products 
developments by others may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  and for licenses of products or technology 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than ours 

table of contents if we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  or are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals  we may be unable to commercialize any products 
our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if our products are marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our pulsys product candidates has been approved for sale in the us or any foreign market 
the regulatory review and approval process takes many years  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
the actual time required for satisfaction of fda pre market approval requirements may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or the medical condition it is intended to treat 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon a manufacturer s activities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may adversely affect the commercialization of any drugs that we or our collaborative partners develop  impose costly procedures on us or our collaborative partners  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborative partners may attain  and adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties 
success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
any required approvals  once obtained  may be withdrawn 
further  if we fail to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process  we may encounter difficulties including delays in clinical trials or commercialization  product recalls or seizures  suspension of production and or distribution  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
we may rely on future collaborative partners to file investigational new drug applications and generally direct the regulatory approval process for many of our products 
these collaborative partners may not be able to conduct clinical testing or obtain necessary approvals from the fda or other regulatory authorities for any product candidates 
if we fail to obtain required governmental approvals  we or our collaborative partners will experience delays in  or be precluded from  marketing products developed through our research 
we and our contract manufacturers also are required to comply with applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations 
good manufacturing practice regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the fda 
these facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our products 
we or our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice requirements and other fda regulatory requirements 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply  we could be subject to fines or other sanctions  or be precluded from marketing our products 

table of contents the manufacture and storage of pharmaceutical and chemical products is subject to environmental regulation and risk 
because of the chemical ingredients of pharmaceutical products and the nature of their manufacturing process  the pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation and the risk of incurring liability for damages or the costs of remedying environmental problems 
we use a number of chemicals and drug substances that can be toxic to humans 
these chemicals include acids  solvents and other reagents used in the normal course of our chemical and pharmaceutical analysis  and other materials  such as polymers  inactive ingredients and drug substances  used in the research  development and manufacture of drug products 
if we fail to comply with environmental regulations to use  discharge or dispose of hazardous materials appropriately or otherwise to comply with the conditions attached to our operating licenses  the licenses could be revoked and we could be subject to criminal sanctions and or substantial liability or could be required to suspend or modify our operations 
environmental laws and regulations can require us to undertake or pay for investigation  clean up and monitoring of environmental contamination identified at properties that we currently own or operate or that we formerly owned or operated 
further  they can require us to undertake or pay for such actions at offsite locations where we may have sent hazardous substances for disposal 
these obligations are often imposed without regard to fault 
in the event we are found to have violated environmental laws or regulations  our reputation will be harmed and we may incur substantial monetary liabilities 
we currently have insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover our present activities 
however  this insurance may not be available or adequate to cover any losses arising from contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous substances 
market acceptance of our products will be limited if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
the commercial success of our product candidates will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  including government health administrators  managed care providers and private health insurers 
even if we succeed in bringing any of our proposed products to market  we cannot assure you that third party payors will consider our products cost effective or provide reimbursement in whole or in part for their use 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
third party payors may conclude that our products are less safe  effective or cost effective than existing products 
therefore  third party payors may not approve our products for reimbursement 
if third party payors do not approve our products for reimbursement or fail to reimburse them adequately  sales will suffer as some physicians or their patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement or is adequately reimbursed 
even if third party payors make reimbursement available  reimbursement levels may not be sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
moreover  the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states  the growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our products 
in addition  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change in ways adverse to us 
while we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these legislative or regulatory proposals  if any government or regulatory agencies adopt these proposals  they could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other risks healthcare ventures v  lp  healthcare ventures vi  lp and healthcare ventures vii  lp have substantial control over our business and the interests of the healthcare ventures partnerships may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders 
healthcare ventures v  lp and healthcare ventures vi  lp currently beneficially own an aggregate of of our outstanding common stock 
james h 
cavanaugh and harold r 
werner  members of our board of directors  are general partners of healthcare partners v  lp and healthcare partners vi  lp  which are the general partners of healthcare ventures v  lp and healthcare ventures vi  lp  respectively 
accordingly  the 
table of contents healthcare ventures partnerships are able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  as well as over the day to day management of our business 
the healthcare ventures partnerships may direct our affairs in a manner that is not consistent with the interests of our other stockholders 
in addition  this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
future sales of our common stock  or the perception that these sales may occur  could depress our stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
this could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities 
selling of a large number of shares by any of our existing shareholders or management shareholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
furthermore  if we file a registration statement to offer additional shares of our common stock and have to include shares held by those holders  it could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and provisions of delaware law could discourage a takeover you may consider favorable or could cause current management to become entrenched and difficult to replace 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition of us  or making a merger or acquisition less desirable to a potential acquirer  even when the stockholders may consider the acquisition or merger favorable 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation  we are authorized to issue million shares of blank check preferred stock  and to determine the price  privileges  and other terms of these shares 
the issuance of any preferred stock with superior rights to our common stock could reduce the value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights we may grant to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict an ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party  preserving control by present owners and management and preventing you from realizing a premium on your shares 
in addition  we are subject to provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
these provisions could affect our stock price adversely 
the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 
prior to october  there was no public market for our common stock 
we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of an active and liquid trading market in our common stock 
the initial public offering price of our common stock was per share 
since our initial public offering  the price of our common stock has been as high as and as low as per share 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them 
if a suit were to be filed against us  regardless of the outcome  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could be forced to pay liquidated damages if we do not maintain the effectiveness of our s registration statement 
in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement  we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s covering the resale of common stock 
the registration rights agreement provides that if a registration statement is not effective within days of closing  or if we do not 
table of contents subsequently maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement  then in addition to any other rights the investor may have  we will be required to pay the investor liquidated damages  in cash  equal to one percent per month of the aggregate purchase price paid by such investor 
the sec declared our form s effective on june   which was within days of closing 
we believe that the events that would lead to a suspension of effectiveness are unlikely to occur 
however  if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement in the future  liquidated damages could be substantial 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties our principal executive offices are located in an approximately  square foot facility in germantown  maryland 
we moved into this facility in may and completed the transfer of our laboratory function to this facility in december the lease for this facility expires in june in august  we entered into a lease for approximately  square feet of additional research and development space  in a building adjacent to the company s existing headquarters in germantown  maryland 
the lease for this facility expires in may we previously had an approximately  square foot lab and office facility in gaithersburg  maryland  the lease for which expired in november also  in september we rented an office of approximately  square feet for engineering space in bridgewater  new jersey under a short term lease that expires in september we believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs 
item legal proceedings we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business  except as discussed below 
in december  aventis and aventis pharmaceuticals inc  now part of sanofi aventis  brought an action against advancis in the us district court for the district of delaware 
the complaint contains six counts  based upon both federal and state law  alleging  in essence  that the we infringed on the plaintiffs trademark 
the plaintiffs seek injunctive relief  as well as unspecified monetary damages 
discovery has been completed  the trial was held in may  and we are currently waiting for the judgment of the court 
we believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the our financial position but could possibly have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period

our business advancis pharmaceutical corporation was incorporated in delaware in december and commenced operations on january  we are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing anti infective drug products that fulfill unmet medical needs in the treatment of infectious disease 
we are developing a portfolio of drugs based on the novel biological finding that bacteria exposed to antibiotics in front loaded  sequential bursts  or pulses  are killed more efficiently than those exposed to standard antibiotic treatment regimens 
we currently have issued us patents covering our proprietary once a day pulsatile delivery technology called pulsys 
we have initially focused on developing pulsys product candidates utilizing approved and marketed drugs that no longer have patent protection or that have patents expiring in the next several years 
our lead pulsatile product candidate  based on the antibiotic amoxicillin  is currently under evaluation in a phase iii clinical trial and our keflex pulsys product candidate  based on the antibiotic cephalexin  is currently under evaluation in a phase i clinical trial 
we also have a number of additional pulsys product candidates in preclinical development 
we acquired the us rights to keflex cephalexin from eli lilly in we currently employ a small sales and marketing staff that is supporting the sale of keflex products to national accounts 
in anticipation of the possible introduction of our first pulsatile product  amoxicillin pulsys  as well as the possible introduction of keflex line extension products  we plan to expand our sales and marketing capabilities by working with contract sales organizations or collaborative marketing partners 
we have entered into agreements with third party contract manufacturers for the commercial supply of our products 
management overview of key developments in the following is a summary of key events that occurred in pulsys product development and collaborations on july   we announced that our pediatric amoxicillin pulsys phase iii clinical trial failed to achieve its desired microbiological and clinical endpoints 
this pivotal program was designed as a patient  investigator blind  non inferiority phase iii trial for a sprinkle formulation of amoxicillin pulsys for the treatment of pharyngitis tonsillitis due to group a streptococcal infections 
we had previously announced on june  that our amoxicillin pulsys phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of pharyngitis tonsillitis in adults and adolescents failed to achieve its desired microbiological and clinical endpoints 
this pivotal program was designed as a patient  double blind  double dummy  non inferiority phase iii trial for a tablet formulation of amoxicillin pulsys for the treatment of pharyngitis tonsillitis due to group a streptococcal infections 
subsequent to the announcement of our unsuccessful phase iii trial results  we reduced our workforce by approximately in order to reduce operating expenses 
we recorded a charge of approximately million in the third quarter for severance costs related to salaries and benefits 
in each of january  april and august  we received payments of million from par pharmaceutical for its quarterly funding due under our amoxicillin pulsys collaboration 
in august  par decided to terminate the collaboration 
as a result of the termination  we recognized revenue in the third quarter of million that had previously been deferred 
in september  after extensive study of the data from our recently concluded unsuccessful amoxicillin pulsys phase iii clinical trials  we decided to conduct a new phase iii trial for adults and adolescents  
table of contents extending the length of treatment from seven days to days  using the current formulation of amoxicillin pulsys 
in november  we held a pre phase iii meeting with the fda to discuss our phase iii trial and regulatory strategy to support product approval for amoxicillin pulsys 
based on the outcome of the meeting  we believe that our phase iii trial design and regulatory strategy for approval of amoxicillin pulsys for adults and adolescents with pharyngitis tonsillitis were acceptable to the fda 
in november  we began enrolling patients into our new phase iii trial for amoxicillin pulsys for adults and adolescents with strep throat 
we expect to enroll at least patients into the trial and announce top line results during the third quarter of in december  we commenced a phase i clinical trial for development of a once daily pulsys version of keflex 
marketed products keflex in  the first full year of our ownership of the keflex brand  net sales of our branded capsule and powder for oral suspension keflex products were approximately million 
an agreement in principle was reached in august to sell the us rights to the keflex brand of cephalexin to a private company 
we received a million advance payment from the potential buyer which ensured its exclusive negotiating rights to the product through december  a definitive agreement was never entered into between the parties  and in january  we decided to retain the brand 
the agreement in principle expired february  we continued development of additional non pulsys keflex line extension products 
in december  we filed a supplemental nda for line extension products 
the application was accepted by the fda in february other events in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  and warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us  after the deduction of fees and commissions  of million 
focus for our primary focus for will be on the conduct of our amoxicillin pulsys phase iii clinical trial for adults and adolescents and  if we receive fda approval of our keflex line extension products  the commercial launch of these products in the second half of we will also continue clinical development of a once daily version of keflex pulsys 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the sale of pharmaceutical products and for payments received under collaboration agreements for licensing  milestones  and reimbursement of development costs 
product sales 
revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales revenue at the time revenues are recognized  based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses for estimated returns or if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesaler 
chargebacks and rebates 
these are based on the difference between the prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the sales price ultimately paid under fixed price contracts by third party payers  including governmental agencies 
we record an estimate at the time of sale to the wholesaler of the amount to be charged back to us or rebated to the end user 
we have recorded reserves for chargebacks and rebates based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends  and our future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks and rebates claimed could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which for our keflex products is typically three years from the date of manufacture for capsules  and two years for oral suspension products 
our return policy typically allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
we estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of our products and our future expectations 
we periodically review the reserves established for returns and adjust them based on actual experience 
the amount of actual product return could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
if we over or under estimate the quantity of product which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
contract revenue 
we use the milestone payment method of revenue recognition when all milestones in respect of payments to be received under contractual arrangements are determined to be substantive  at risk and the culmination of an earnings process 
substantive milestones are payments that are conditioned upon events requiring substantive effort  when the amounts of the milestones are reasonable relative to the time  effort and risk involved in achieving them and when the milestones are reasonable relative to each other and the amount of any up front payment 
if these criteria are not met  the timing of the recognition of revenue from the milestone payment may vary 
up front payments are recorded as deferred revenue 
we estimate the length of the remaining development period and amortize an up front payment over that development period 
reimbursement of development costs 
we record revenue for reimbursement of development costs as the actual costs to perform the work are incurred 
we are required to use judgment in recognizing reimbursement revenue in cases where the agreement provides for funding to us that is not dependent on actual costs we incur within a specific fiscal period 
for our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys  for example  we were entitled to quarterly payments in pre established amounts that funded our development work 
our policy is to limit revenue recognized to the minimum amounts expected under a specific collaboration agreement and to exclude amounts contingent on future events  such as successful commercialization and future profit sharing  and amounts that are contingently refundable 
revenue recognized is limited to cumulative amounts under each contract such that  at any time  if a termination of the agreement were to occur  revenue previously recognized would not need to be reversed 
cash received in excess of revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue  with the deferred revenue recognized as revenue at the time future events occur that remove the contingencies 

table of contents inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out method 
inventory consists of keflex finished capsules and finished oral suspension powder 
we purchase our keflex products from third party manufacturers only at the completion of the manufacturing process  and accordingly have no raw material or work in process inventories 
at least on a quarterly basis  we review our inventory levels and write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or is in excess of expected requirements 
during  we recorded an inventory reserve provision of approximately  to cost of product sales related to slow moving and obsolete inventory 
intangible assets acquired intangible assets 
we acquired the us rights to the keflex brand of cephalexin in we may acquire additional pharmaceutical products in the future that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
when intangible assets are acquired  we review and identify the individual intangible assets acquired and record them based on relative fair values 
each identifiable intangible asset is then reviewed to determine if it has a definite life or indefinite life  and definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment 
we assess the impairment of our identifiable definite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these factors  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses for services performed and liabilities incurred 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses for services include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we also make estimates for other liabilities incurred  including health insurance costs for our employees 
we are self insured for claims made under our health insurance program and record an estimate at the end of a period for claims not yet reported 
our risk exposure is limited  as claims over a maximum amount are covered by an aggregate stop loss insurance policy 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting 
table of contents method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in the notes to our financial statements we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
the factors which are most likely to affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
since the company s initial public offering in october  we have used the quoted market price of our common stock as the fair value  and we have established an estimate for volatility by considering the volatility of the stock of other comparable public companies 
we expect to adopt sfas r  share based payment  in the first quarter of income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december   and we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot presently be sufficiently assured 
at december  and  we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  which will begin to expire in under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code  certain substantial changes in our ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and research and experimentation tax credit carry forwards which can be used in future years 
during and prior years  we may have experienced such ownership changes 
when we complete the necessary studies  the amount of net operating loss carryovers may be reduced 
however  since the valuation allowance fully reserves for all available carryovers  the effect of the reduction would be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance 
thus  the resolution of this matter would have no effect on our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires public companies to recognize expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including employee stock options  using a fair value based option pricing model  and eliminates the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting for share based payments 
accordingly  we plan to begin recognizing the expense associated with our share based payments  as determined using a fair value based method  in our statement of operations beginning on january  adoption of the expense provisions of sfas r is expected to have a material  noncash impact on our results of operations 
the standard allows alternative transition methods for public companies 
we expect to adopt the modified prospective application method as our transition method 
under this method  prior periods will not be restated 
compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding as of january  will be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost for the unvested portion of those earlier awards will be based on the fair value at date of grant as previously calculated in our pro forma disclosure under sfas  net of estimated forfeitures 
in february  the eitf added to its agenda issue no 
 the effect of a liquidated damages clause on a freestanding financial instrument subject to eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the issue addresses liquidated damages provisions associated with registration rights agreements and the diversity in practice that exists in accounting for such provisions 
in june and september  the eitf discussed the issue but did not reach a 
table of contents consensus 
further deliberations by the eitf have been postponed until the fasb addresses whether a registration rights agreement is a derivative 
the company is monitoring the progress of the fasb and eitf on this issue 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas generally requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles 
under the prior rules  changes in accounting principles were generally recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement does not change the previous requirements for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements  change in accounting estimate  or justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of the provisions of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp fas addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  fsp fas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
research and development expenses we expect our research and development expenses to be significant we continue to develop our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  and costs of facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
the following table summarizes research and development expense for our product development initiatives for the fiscal years ended december   and see our product pipeline above for our current priority product candidates

table of contents many of our research and development costs are not attributable to any individual project because we share resources across several development projects 
we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
we currently have an adult and adolescent amoxicillin formulation in a phase iii clinical trial  which commenced enrollment in november we previously conducted phase iii clinical trials for the adolescent adult formulation which commenced october  and for the pediatric formulation which commenced on january  these two previous phase iii trials failed to achieve their desired microbiological and clinical endpoints 
see amoxicillin pulsys clinical results above 
we previously had an agreement under which par pharmaceutical was be responsible for funding the anticipated future development costs of this product 
see termination of our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys above 
we have discontinued development efforts for this product 
see our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for generic clarithromycin above 
net losses we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts  approval and commercial launch of new products  and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional annual losses  perhaps at higher levels  for the foreseeable future

stock issuances in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in net proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
the warrants are exercisable for five years 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period after contractual obligations  total in thousands short and long term debt includes interest minimum purchase commitments operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments this table does not include potential royalty payments  at a rate of of sales value  to eli lilly and company  which may be due on product line extensions of keflex 
any such royalties cannot be estimated at this time 
this table does not include a contingent liability to par pharmaceutical under our amoxicillin development and commercialization agreement that was terminated by par in august under certain circumstances  the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle par to receive a share of future net profits  if any  up to one half of par s total million investment in the development of certain amoxicillin pulsys products  should a product covered by the agreement be successfully commercialized 
accordingly  we retained million of deferred revenue in recognition of this contingent liability to par 
we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with ceph international for the manufacturing of our keflex products 
this agreement contains a provision for minimum purchase requirements 
we have entered into other contractual agreements in connection with developing our products and technology and to perform clinical trials 
this amount represents the remaining contractual amount due for our on going phase iii clinical trial 
although the contract could be cancelled by us  in which case we would be liable to the 
table of contents vendor for work performed to the date of cancellation  it is our intent to complete the clinical trial at the remaining cost of approximately million 
in addition to the contractual obligations in the above table  the company may incur funding liabilities for obligations which it enters into on a discretionary basis 
these discretionary obligations could include additional facilities or equipment  investments in new technologies or products  acquisitions  funding of clinical trials  or similar events 
as of december   we are not committed to fund any further pre production development work at the clonmel facility  however  should our amoxicillin pulsys phase iii trial be successful  our intention would be to fund approximately million of additional development work at clonmel  primarily in late and early  to prepare for commercial production of amoxicillin pulsys 
during fiscal we spent approximately million for capital expenditures  primarily for equipment purchased for use at third party manufacturing facilities  as well as for use in our research and development facility in germantown  maryland 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that meet the definition of off balance sheet arrangements  with the exception of our private placement of common stock and warrants in april warrants are instruments that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas  although they qualify for the scope exception under paragraph of sfas in the private placement  warrants were issued to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
prospective information we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses in  including expenses related to preclinical testing and clinical trials 
we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase in  assuming fda approval of our keflex line extension products and commercial launch of the new products 
if the launch is successful  we will collect cash on these incremental sales which would offset some or all of our increased selling and marketing expenses in we believe the keflex line extension products have the potential to generate significant cash in excess of selling costs in we also expect a limited window of opportunity for these products  approximating to months  should generic pharmaceutical companies decide to compete with our line extension products 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the continued progress of our research and development of product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  payments received or made under any future collaborative agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the acquisition of licenses to new products or compounds  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing and our or our partners success in developing markets for our product candidates 
after receiving the results in june and july of our unsuccessful pediatric and adult phase iii trials  we conducted an intensive analysis of the data with the intent to reach a conclusion regarding the future of our amoxicillin pulsys development program 
we also considered how to maximize the future value of our keflex franchise 
each of these outstanding matters has significant implications for our anticipated level of future spending and our capital available to fund future operations 
in september  we announced our decisions regarding these outstanding matters 
we decided to continue our amoxicillin pulsys development program and to conduct a new phase iii clinical trial 
we also decided to investigate the potential sale of the keflex brand in order to increase our level of unrestricted cash on hand 
in july and september  we reduced our workforce by approximately as part of an initiative to reduce operating expenses 
the cost reduction will enhance our ability to rely on our existing resources to fund our operations over the next year 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million on hand as of december   together with the effect of the reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of and product revenue collections in from sales of our currently marketed keflex products  provide us with enough capital resources to finance our ongoing operations  including our new phase iii clinical trial  until at least 
table of contents the first quarter of we will continue to balance our pace of development with our funding position  and we anticipate the resources described above will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses  debt repayments and capital equipment requirements for at least the next months  barring unforeseen developments 
this forecast is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
we have no unused credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital  incur indebtedness  or consider the sale of company assets in order to fund our operations 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts  effect changes to our facilities or personnel  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
any future funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash that generally have maturities of less than one year 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but may increase the interest expense associated with our debt 
our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
