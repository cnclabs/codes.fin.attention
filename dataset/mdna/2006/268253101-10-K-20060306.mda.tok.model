item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those described in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in item a under the caption risk factors 
this discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary ecb bancorp  inc is a bank holding company headquartered in engelhard  north carolina 
our wholly owned subsidiary  the east carolina bank the bank  is a state chartered community bank that was founded in for the purpose of this discussion  we  us and our refers to the bank and the bank holding company as a single  consolidated entity unless the context otherwise indicates 
our consolidated assets increased to million on december   from million at year end our loan portfolio increased to million at december   from loans of million at year end while deposits increased to million at year end from million at year end total shareholders equity was approximately million at year end in  our net income was million or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared to net income of million or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the net income represents an increase of million over reported net income 
the net income is approximately thousand or per diluted share greater than the net income that would have been reported absent certain one time charges and gains more fully discussed below 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are set forth in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
of these significant accounting policies  we consider our policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be our most critical accounting policy  because it requires management s most subjective and complex judgments 
in addition  changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses and  therefore  the provision for loan losses and results of operations 
we have developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to our loan portfolio 
our assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the results of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that is not known to management 
for additional discussion concerning our allowance for loan losses and related matters  see allowance for loan losses and nonperforming assets and past due loans 
results of operations for the years ended december   and in  our net income was million or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared to net income of million or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  our net income for included an other than temporary impairment non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter related to million face value of perpetual preferred stock issued by the federal national mortgage corporation fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  both government sponsored entities 
the decision to record the other than temporary impairment charge was based on generally accepted accounting practices and sec accounting guidance and because the securities did not have specific maturity dates 
though these were investment grade securities rated aa by s p  aa by moody s at the time the impairment was recognized  after a thorough analysis  and like many of our industry peers who had recently taken similar action  we concluded that the securities should be considered impaired as of year end and we reflected the charge on our income statement 
absent the other than temporary charge of million  which was partially off set by a thousand net of taxes reduction in the accrual for our annual incentive plan to reflect the effect of the write down on our operating results and excluding a one time gain on the receipt of an insurance settlement of thousand net of taxes recorded in  our net income for the year would have been approximately million  our earnings per diluted share would have been representing an increase over the earned per diluted share in the fiscal year  as compared to the decrease actually recorded  and our return on equity roe would have been

we continued to make strategic investments in our future during as we moved into our new  square foot corporate headquarters and branch office in engelhard and constructed two new buildings to replace existing facilities housing our southern shores kitty hawk and hertford branches 
net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets  such as loans and investment securities and the interest paid on liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings is our primary source of operating income 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume of interest earning assets and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average interest rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities  the ability to manage the interest earning asset portfolio  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does not consider the impact of noninterest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing noninterest bearing deposits in earning assets 
our net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or when compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  for was compared to for the increased net interest margin resulted from the increase in our average earning assets 
our net interest rate spread  on a tax equivalent basis  for was compared to for as a result of interest bearing liabilities repricing faster than interest earning assets  the spread decreased by two basis points as the change in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities was two basis points greater than the change in yields earned on interest earning assets for the period 
total interest income increased million or to million in compared to million in interest income in increases in our average earning assets of million in when compared to resulted in million of the increase in interest income from to we funded the increases in interest earning assets primarily with in market certificates of deposit and additional wholesale certificates of deposit obtained through an internet bulletin board service 
supplementing the additional earnings from increased volumes of earning assets was the increase in yield on earning assets 
the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets increased basis points during and resulted in million of the increase in interest income 
we attribute the increase in the yield on our earning assets to the increase in short term market interest rates 
between january  and december   the federal open market committee fomc increased short term rates basis points from to through a succession of basis point increases 
approximately million or of our loan portfolio consists of variable rate loans that adjust with the movement of the national prime rate 
as a result  composite yield on our loans increased approximately basis points for the year ended december  compared to december  similarly  our average cost of funds for was  an increase of basis points when compared to for the average cost on bank certificates of deposit increased basis points from paid in to paid in  while our average cost of borrowed funds increased basis points during compared to total interest expense increased to million in from to million in  primarily the result of increased volume of interest bearing liabilities and increased market rates paid on borrowed funds and wholesale certificates of deposit 
the volume of average interest bearing liabilities increased approximately million when comparing with that of the increase to interest expense resulting from increased rates on all interest bearing liabilities was million and the increase attributable to higher volumes of interest bearing liabilities was thousand 
throughout  we believe our net interest margin will improve or remain relatively stable due to anticipated target federal funds rate increases by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board 
however  this expectation may not be realized and our net interest margin could decline if competitive deposit pricing pressure from the increases in interest rates by the federal reserve board causes us to increase the rates we pay on interest bearing deposits to a greater degree than we currently anticipate 
our net interest income for was million  an increase of million or when compared to net interest income of million earned during our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  for the year ended december  was compared to in management attributes the decrease in our net interest margin to the sustained low interest rate environment throughout all of many of our rate sensitive liabilities  especially interest bearing transaction accounts such as now and money market accounts  reached levels during and such that additional rate reductions were not practical  thus reducing our ability to lower our cost of funds even as the rates we earned on interest earning assets continued to decline in accordance with the market and resulting in an basis point decline in our tax equivalent net interest rate spread from for to for as our rate sensitive assets  such as loans and investment securities  continued to mature and pay out  proceeds from these earning assets were reinvested at lower prevailing interest rates 
the yield on average earning assets  on a tax equivalent basis  fell basis points during to compared to in total interest income increased million during compared to  due to an increase of million in average earning assets 
approximately million in interest income can be attributed to the additional volume of earning assets in relative to while the effect of lower rates earned on interest earning assets in relative to reduced the additional income by approximately million 
the effect of variances in volume and rate on interest income and interest expense is illustrated in the table titled change in interest income and expense on tax equivalent basis 
total interest expense increased thousand during compared to  the result of increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities 
our cost of funds during was  a decrease of nine basis points when compared to in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities increased million in and as a result increased interest expense by approximately thousand 
the effect of lower interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities during resulted in reduced interest expense of thousand producing a net increase in interest expense of thousand

rate sensitivity management rate sensitivity management  an important aspect of achieving satisfactory levels of net interest income  is the management of the composition and maturities of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth our interest sensitivity analysis at december  and describes  at various cumulative maturity intervals  the gap ratios ratios of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for assets and liabilities that we consider to be rate sensitive 
the interest sensitivity position has meaning only as of the date for which it was prepared 
variable rate loans are considered to be highly sensitive to rate changes and are assumed to reprice within months 
the difference between interest sensitive asset and interest sensitive liability repricing within time periods is referred to as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
gaps are identified as either positive interest sensitive assets in excess of interest sensitive liabilities or negative interest sensitive liabilities in excess of interest sensitive assets 
as of december   we had a negative one year cumulative gap of 
we have interest earning assets of million maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities of million repricing or maturing within one year 
this is primarily the result of short term interest sensitive liabilities being used to fund longer term interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities 
a negative gap position implies that interest bearing liabilities deposits and other borrowings will reprice at a faster rate than interest earning assets loans and investments 
in a falling rate environment  a negative gap position will generally have a positive effect on earnings  while in a rising rate environment this will generally have a negative effect on earnings 
on december   our savings and core time deposits of million included savings  now and money market accounts of million 
in our rate sensitivity analysis  these deposits are considered as repricing in the earliest period months or less because the rate we pay on these interest bearing deposits can be changed weekly 
however  our historical experience has shown that changes in market interest rates have little  if any  effect on those deposits within a given time period and  for that reason  those liabilities could be considered non rate sensitive 
if those deposits were excluded from rate sensitive liabilities  our rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be more closely matched at the end of the one year period

approximately of interest bearing liabilities could be repriced within one year and approximately could be repriced within five years 
market risk our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results from differing maturities or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the fact that rates on these financial instruments do not change uniformly 
these conditions may impact the earnings generated by our interest earning assets or the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  thus directly impacting our overall earnings 
we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk 
one way this is accomplished is through the development of and adherence to our asset liability policy 
this policy sets forth our strategy for matching the risk characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities so as to mitigate the effect of changes in the rate environment

unrealized gains and losses on the securities were previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet 
absent the impairment charge in  noninterest income would have been substantially the same in as in service charges on deposit accounts remained stable in relative to while other service charges and fees increased thousand or in compared to the increase in other service charges and fees over the prior year period is principally due to increased mortgage origination brokerage fees of thousand and financial services fees of thousand offset by minor decreases in other fees 
the increase in mortgage origination brokerage fees in resulted from increases in the number of locations and staff offering mortgage brokerage services compared to the previous year 
in the fourth quarter of  the bank sold its credit card portfolio with outstanding balances of approximately million for a premium that resulted in a gain on sale of credit card loans of thousand 
that gain compares to proceeds received on insurance settlements in  both of which were nonrecurring 
during  we realized net gains on sale of securities of thousand  which was thousand less than we realized in noninterest income decreased thousand or to million during compared to million in this decrease is principally due to the impairment charge of million on fhlmc and fnma perpetual preferred stock that we recognized in the impairment charge was partially offset by a gain on insurance proceeds in of thousand for property damage we sustained as a result of hurricane isabel in and an insurance recovery of thousand on a wire transfer fraud that was charged off in late service charges on deposit accounts increased by thousand or as account overdraft fee income increased slightly when compared to other service charges and fees increased thousand or in over the prior year period due to increases in net merchant discount fees generated by our credit card and merchant services department and increased net business manager service charge fees of thousand 
during  we had a net gain on the sale of securities of thousand compared to net gain of thousand on the sale of securities during noninterest expense noninterest expense increased million or to million in compared to million in and noninterest expense increased million or in compared to million in the increase in all periods is principally due to increases in salary and benefits expense 
the following table presents the components of noninterest expense for  and noninterest expense year ended december  dollars in thousands salaries retirement and other employee benefits occupancy equipment professional fees supplies telephone postage other total expenses for salaries and benefits increased  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in salary and benefit expenses is related to staff additions to accommodate our growth  additional branches and the expansion of our mortgage origination department 
as of december   we had full time equivalent employees and operated full service banking offices and three mortgage loan origination offices 
salary expense increased thousand or in compared to as we continued to add business development officers in some of our newer markets and additional originators to our expanding mortgage loan brokerage service 
employee benefits increased thousand or in over the prior year principally due to increased employee incentive expense of thousand  increased group insurance of thousand and increased fica tax of thousand 
in  management reduced its annual employee incentive plan accruals by approximately thousand to reflect the effect of the investment securities impairment write down on our operating results 
occupancy expense increased thousand or to million in compared to million in the largest component of the increase was building depreciation expense  which increased thousand in relative to the substantial increase in depreciation expense in was primarily due to our acceleration of the remaining depreciation of approximately thousand on our old southern shores kitty hawk office facility  which was demolished in the first quarter of we also experienced increased depreciation expense on our new corporate office in increased property taxes  building rentals for our mortgage brokerage services and janitorial services accounted for the remaining portion of occupancy expense increase during professional fees  which include audit  legal and consulting fees  increased thousand or to thousand for relative to the same period in the increase in professional fees during compared to was principally due to increased audit and accounting fees of thousand due to additional year end control testing in our data processing area and requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of consulting fees increased thousand to thousand in from thousand for these increased consulting fees were incurred for services pertaining to strategic planning  disaster recovery business resumption planning and independent credit review performed during the first quarter of telephone expense in compared to increased thousand or  which resulted from adding high speed t communication lines to our network necessary for future implementation of a new loan and deposit platform and online teller system 
other operating expenses increased thousand or for compared to as other outside services increased thousand or due primarily to personnel services 
salary expense increased thousand or in over the prior year period as a result of general salary increases of thousand and additional staffing expense within our mortgage department and home office of thousand and thousand  respectively 
additional salary expenses of thousand in were associated with our newly opened full service offices in williamston  morehead city and wilmington 
benefits expense during compared to increased thousand or principally due to an increase in premiums for employee group insurance of thousand and employee fica taxes of thousand 
restricted stock incentive expense increased thousand in over the prior year period due to additional restricted stock awarded in these increases in employee benefits were partially offset by a reduction in incentive expense of thousand in when compared to occupancy expense increased thousand or as property taxes and insurance increased thousand or and janitorial expense increased thousand or due to the new branch offices and main home office buildings 
these increases were partially offset by reduction of depreciation expense of approximately thousand on the bank s flood damaged accounting and operations facility  damage that occurred as a result of hurricane isabel in equipment expense increased thousand or in relative to due principally to an increase in equipment maintenance of thousand or and an increase in equipment rental expense of thousand or 
telephone expense decreased thousand or in when compared to long distance telephone expense decreased thousand or over the prior year  as we received a credit adjustment of thousand due to being over charged by our long distance carrier in prior billing periods 
other operating expenses increased thousand from million in to million for the increase was primarily due to the charge off of thousand in checks paid into overdraft that were deemed non collectible in the current period 
we experienced losses on sale of repossessed assets that amounted to thousand 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million  compared to million for the same period of our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate for was due to the change in valuation allowance as a result of the million impairment charge on investments taken at year end due to the sale of such preferred stock during  the capital losses have now been realized 
however  management does not believe that these capital losses will be able to be offset in future periods by capital gains 
as such  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was thousand and thousand december  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance required at december  was for certain unrealized capital losses related to perpetual preferred stock issued by fnma and fhlmc 
these losses are capital in character and we may not have current capital gain capacity to offset these losses 
the effective tax rate in differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest income we earned on tax exempt securities in our investment portfolio 
income tax expense for and was million and million  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate for was due to the change in valuation allowance as a result of the million impairment charge on investments taken at year end the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was thousand at december   and none for the year ended december  the effective tax rates in year differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest income we earned on certain securities in our investment portfolio and state income tax expense 
financial condition at december   and our total assets were million at december   million at december  and million at december  asset growth during was funded primarily by an increase in noninterest bearing deposits of million and an increase in time deposits of million 
for the years ended december  and  we grew our loans million and million  respectively  by increasing loan originations 
for the years ended december  and  we grew our deposits million and million  respectively  through marketing of core deposits and wholesale certificates of deposit  the proceeds of which were invested in interest earning assets 
at december   total assets increased million to million  an increase of when compared to total assets of million at december  asset growth was funded by an increase in interest bearing demand deposits of million  an increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits of million and increased savings and time deposits of million 
we believe our financial condition is sound 
the following discussion focuses on the factors considered by us to be important in assessing our financial condition 
the following table sets forth the relative composition of our balance sheets at december   and distribution of assets and liabilities december  dollars in thousands assets loans  gross investment securities interest bearing deposits fhlb stock total earning assets allowance for loan losses noninterest bearing deposits and cash bank premises and equipment  net other assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity demand deposits savings  now and money market deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits short term borrowings long term obligations accrued interest and other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity loans as of december   total loans increased to million  up from total loans of million at december  construction and land development loans increased from million in to million in the majority of this loan growth can be attributed to demand for commercial construction loans  which increased by approximately million from to commercial and residential real estate loans increased million from year end to year end we believe that general loan growth will remain strong in the near term  although rising market interest rates may have a negative effect on loan demand 
funding of future loan growth may be restricted by our ability to raise core deposits  although we will consider alternative funding sources if we deem it necessary and cost effective 
loan growth may also be restricted by the necessity for us to maintain appropriate capital and liquidity levels 
loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december  we have experienced steady loan demand in all of our existing markets 
real estate related loans increased approximately million at year end from year end and accounted for essentially all of the loan growth during real estate loans secured by non farm  non residential properties increased million  while construction and land development loans increased by million in our two new full service banking offices located in wilmington and morehead city contributed approximately of the loan growth achieved in our western region increased loans by approximately million and the outer banks region increased loans by approximately million when compared to we continued to adhere to our strict underwriting standards as we increased our loan portfolio in our loan portfolio contains no foreign loans  and we believe the portfolio is adequately diversified 
real estate loans represent approximately of our loan portfolio 
real estate loans are primarily loans secured by real estate  including mortgage and construction loans 
residential mortgage loans accounted for approximately million or of our real estate loans at december  commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries  with no particular industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
at december   our ten largest loans accounted for approximately of our loans outstanding 
as of december   we had outstanding loan commitments of approximately million 
the amounts of loans outstanding at the indicated dates are shown in the following table according to loan type 
loan portfolio composition december  dollars in thousands real estate construction and land development real estate commercial  residential and other installment loans credit cards and related plans commercial and all other loans total the majority of the commercial real estate is owner occupied and operated 
maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates the following table sets forth the maturity distribution of our loans as of december  a significant majority of our loans maturing after one year reprice at two and three year intervals 
in addition  approximately of our loan portfolio is comprised of variable rate loans 
loan maturities at december  due in year or less due after year through years due after years total floating fixed floating fixed real estate construction and land development real estate commercial  residential and other installment loans credit cards and related plans commercial and all other loans total allowance for loan losses we consider the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover estimated probable loan losses relating to the loans outstanding as of each reporting period 
the procedures and methods used in the determination of the allowance necessarily rely upon various judgements and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting our loans 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
those agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about the information available to them at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
the following table summarizes the balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by category and additions to the allowance that have been charged to expense

losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in our opinion  become uncollectible 
recoveries during the period are credited to this allowance 
the factors that influence our judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense as a provision to add to the allowance for loan losses include past due loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of estimated loan losses and current economic conditions 
our loan watch committee  which includes three members of senior management as well as regional managers and other credit administration personnel  conducts a quarterly review of all loans classified as substandard 
this review follows a re evaluation by the account officer who has primary responsibility for the relationship with the borrower 
as mentioned previously  during the bank sold its credit card portfolio with outstanding balances of approximately million 
prior to the sale  the bank had reserved of the outstanding balances in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance was reduced by thousand when the credit card portfolio was sold in the fourth quarter of allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december   the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses assigned to real estate loans increased thousand or compared to the portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to real estate loans at december  the shift in allocation is primarily the result of loan volume growth of real estate loans and risk grades assigned to individual loans during our assessment of credit quality during our unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses increased thousand or as the result of our evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured by any other component of the reserve and that are not tied to particular categories of or individual loans 
one element of this evaluation is the seasoning of the loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the allocation of allowance for loan losses and percent of our total loans represented by the loans in each loan category for each of the years presented 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands real estate installment loans credit cards and related plans commercial and all other loans total allocated unallocated total nonperforming assets and past due loans the following table summarizes our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets and past due loans december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans loans past due or more days still accruing restructured loans repossessions foreclosed properties total a loan is placed on non accrual status when  in our judgment  the collection of interest income appears doubtful or the loan is past due days or more 
interest receivable that has been accrued and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectibility is charged to the appropriate interest income account 
interest on loans that are classified as non accrual is recognized when received 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original terms 
foreclosed properties are initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
thereafter the properties are maintained at the lower of cost or fair value 
at december  and  nonperforming assets and past due loans were approximately and  respectively  of the loans outstanding at such dates 
the impact of our non accrual loans at december   on our interest income for the year then ended was not material 
any loans that are classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard or special mention  and that are not included as non performing loans  do not i represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  or ii represent material credits about which management has any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have various financial instruments outstanding commitments with off balance sheet risk that are issued in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
we also have contractual cash obligations and commitments  including certificates of deposit  other borrowings  operating leases and loan commitments 
the following tables set forth our commercial commitments and contractual payment obligations as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands loan commitments and lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments payments due contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands long term obligations short term borrowings operating leases deposits total contractual obligations investment portfolio the composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
our securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for investing available funds  furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowed funds 
we use two categories to classify our securities held to maturity and available for sale 
currently  none of our investments are classified as held to maturity 
while we have no plans to liquidate a significant amount of our securities  the securities classified as available for sale may be sold to meet liquidity needs should management deem it to be in our best interest 
our investment securities totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  additions to the investment securities portfolio depend to a large extent on the availability of investable funds that are not otherwise needed to satisfy loan demand 
in general  because of loan funding needs  we have historically used proceeds from investment maturities and calls to originate loans  leading to a reduction in a level of investment securities at december  that was million lower than the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  investable funds not otherwise utilized are temporarily invested as federal funds sold or as interest bearing balances at other banks  the level of which is affected by such considerations as near term loan demand and liquidity needs 
at december   our investment portfolio increased by million  or to from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from purchases of million in additional investment securities  which we funded with federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings and brokered deposits

to date  these core funds  supplemented by fhlb advances and a modest amount of brokered deposits  have been adequate to fund loan demand in our market areas  while maintaining the desired level of immediate liquidity and an investment securities portfolio available for both immediate and secondary liquidity purposes

however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
notwithstanding these effects of inflation  management believes our financial results are influenced more by our ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation
