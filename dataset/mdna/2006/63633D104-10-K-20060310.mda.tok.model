executive overview national health investors  inc nhi or the company  a maryland corporation  is a real estate investment trust reit that invests primarily in income producing health care properties with emphasis on the long term health care sector 
as of december   we had interests in real estate owned  and investments in mortgages  preferred stock and marketable securities resulting in total invested assets of  founded in  our mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by making mortgage loans and acquiring properties to lease nationwide primarily in the long term health care industry 
portfolio as of december   we had investments in health care facilities located in states consisting of long term care facilities  one acute care hospital  four medical office buildings  assisted living facilities  six retirement centers and residential projects for the developmentally disabled 
these investments consisted of approximately  aggregate carrying value amount of loans to borrowers and  of real estate investments with lessees 
of these facilities  were acquired through foreclosure and are operated by us 
these facilities have been sold  but we have not yet met the accounting criteria to record the sales 
our largest customer is national heatlhcare corporation nhc 
of our facilities  are leased to nhc 
these facilities include four centers leased to other parties  the lease payments of which are guaranteed to us by nhc 
also  the properties operated by us are managed by subsidiaries of nhc 
nhc was our investment advisor until november  consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have increased our portfolio so that the portion of our portfolio operated by nhc has been reduced from of our total portfolio on october  the date we began operations to of total portfolio on december

table of contents areas of focus reflecting our improving outlook for the healthcare industry  we anticipate making new investments in while continuing to monitor and improve our existing properties 
even as we make new investments  however  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt vs 
equity compared to our historical levels 
new investments may be funded by our liquid investments and  if needed  by external financing 
we will make new investments where we believe the spreads over our cost of capital will generate returns to our investors 
we have focused on lowering our debt 
our debt to capitalization ratio on december  was  the lowest level in our year history 
our liquidity is also strong with cash and marketable securities of  exceeding our total debt outstanding of  at the end of on december   we reached an agreement with nhc to extend through december  our current lease on of our real estate properties 
these facilities include four centers leased to other parties  and three retirement centers 
this extension assures an ongoing relationship with our largest customer 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
we consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
please refer to note of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us 
there have been no material changes to these policies in our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments the majority of our tenants and borrowers are in the long term health care industry and derive their revenues primarily from medicare  medicaid and other government programs 
amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints 
from time to time  there may be material changes in government reimbursement 
in the past  the long term health care industry has at times experienced material reductions in government reimbursement 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing for our lessees and mortgagees 
we have determined that impairment of certain of our investments have occurred as the result of these events 

table of contents decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying amount of the property and may be affected by management s plans  if any  to dispose of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
on a quarterly basis  nhi reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances  including the non receipt of principal and interest payments  significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  an impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 
we evaluate our marketable securities for other than temporary impairments consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accountant standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas as amended by eitf the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an impairment of a marketable security would be considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties  notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers for which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not realizable 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight line basis as required under sfas to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible 
lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property  such as an increase in annual revenues over a base year revenues  are considered to be contingent rentals and are excluded from minimum lease payments in accordance with sfas reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition third party payors approximately two thirds of our facility operating revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the third party payors 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that 
table of contents may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts  the revenues of facilities we operate  proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans receivable 
our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions  the expenses of facilities we operate  debt service payments including principal and interest  real property acquisitions and general and administrative expenses

this debt was repaid with cash that was earning less than the cost of the repaid debt and as a result was immediately accretive to earnings 
this compares to the corresponding prior year activity of principal payments on debt of  and dividends paid to stockholders of  preferred stock conversion on april   of nhi s cumulative convertible preferred stock  with a balance of  shares or  was called by nhi for redemption into common stock of nhi at a conversion rate of

a contingency related to damaged property is more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
real estate and mortgage writedowns recoveries our borrowers  tenants and the properties we operate as foreclosure properties have experienced financial pressures and difficulties similar to those experienced by the health care industry in general since governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
a number of our real estate property operators and mortgage loan borrowers have experienced bankruptcy 
others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure and have otherwise failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us

additionally  we designated one additional nursing facility as held for sale  consistent with the provisions of sfas 
table of contents for and  we have reclassified the operations  including the net gain on the sale of these facilities  as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the year ended december   on a diluted basis was  a decrease of  as compared to  for the same period in ffo represents net earnings available to common stockholders  excluding the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation associated with real estate investments 
diluted ffo assumes  if dilutive  the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures  the conversion of cumulative convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method 
we believe that funds from operations is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative  and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
since other reits may not use our definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our company s ffo to that of other reits 
funds from operations in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states  as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
we have complied with the sec s interpretation that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo 
the sec s position is that recurring impairments on real property are not an appropriate adjustment 
the following table reconciles net income to funds from operations year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts net income dividends to preferred stockholders net income available to common stockholders elimination of non cash items in net income real estate depreciation real estate depreciation in discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate basic funds from operations available to common stockholders interest on convertible subordinated debentures diluted funds from operations available to common stockholders basic funds from operations per share diluted funds from operations per share shares for basic funds from operations per share shares for diluted funds from operations per share 
table of contents impact of inflation during the past three years  inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of relatively moderate inflation rates 
inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting our cost of financing its operations 
our revenues are generated primarily from long term investments with fixed rates of return 
these investments are financed through a combination of equity  long term borrowings  and  as needed  line of credit arrangements 
during periods of rising interest rates  our ability to grow may be adversely affected because yields on new investments may increase more slowly than new borrowing costs 
certain of our leases offer some degree of inflation protection by requiring increases in rental income based upon increases in the revenues of the tenants
