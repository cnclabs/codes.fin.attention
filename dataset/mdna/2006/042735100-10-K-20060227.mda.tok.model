a number of member countries  however  have not yet enacted legislation or delayed their legislation s effective date 
under weee  a manufacturer or importer will be required  at its own cost  to take back and recycle all of the products it manufactured in or imported into the eu 
to date  there has not been a material impact to the company s business due to the implementation of weee 
since weee has only recently been implemented in certain eu member countries and not yet implemented in others  it is unclear what business impact it will have on the company s operations 
thus  it is difficult to quantify the impact  if any  of weee on the company s financial performance 
both directives will affect the worldwide electronics and electronic components industries  and collaborative efforts among suppliers  distributors and customers to develop compliant processes are continuing 
pending those developments  the full implementation of existing regulations  and the final enactment of enabling legislation for the remaining eu member countries  it is not possible to estimate the cost of compliance or the costs associated with inventory that could become unsaleable 
also under consideration are similar regulations in other jurisdictions  such as china 
the promulgation of policies and procedures geared to comply with these regulations and those described above with regard to the eu  may result in significant costs to the company 
contractual obligations payments due under contractual obligations at december  were as follows in thousands within after year years years years total long term debt a interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations b other c a includes convertible debentures of million 
the company subsequently redeemed these convertible debentures in february b amounts represent an estimate of non cancelable inventory purchase orders and other contractual obligations related to information technology and facilities as of december  most of the 
table of contents company s inventory purchases are pursuant to authorized distributor agreements  which are typically cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice  usually within a few months 
c includes estimates of contributions required to meet the requirements of several defined benefit plans 
amounts are subject to change based upon the performance of plan assets  as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation 
the company is unable to estimate the projected contributions beyond also included are amounts relating to personnel  customer termination  and certain other costs resulting from restructuring and integration activities 
amounts relating to facilities are included in operating leases 
under the terms of various joint venture agreements  the company would be required to pay its pro rata share  based upon its ownership interests  of the third party debt of the joint ventures in the event that the joint ventures were unable to meet their obligations 
at december   the company s pro rata share of this debt was million 
the company believes there is sufficient equity in the joint ventures to cover this potential liability 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has a made guarantees  b a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  c any obligation under certain derivative instruments or d any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the company  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services within the company 
the company does not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and integration costs  and contingencies and litigation  on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  and returns 
a portion of the company s business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  the company recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product has been shipped 
in addition  the company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis that is  the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon an evaluation of its business and accounting practices  the company determined that revenue related to the sale of service contracts should more appropriately be classified on an agency basis rather than a gross basis 
while this change reduced reported sales 
table of contents and cost of sales  it had no impact on gross profit  operating income  net income  cash flow  or the balance sheet 
all prior period sales and cost of sales were reclassified to present the revenue related to the sale of service contracts on an agency basis 
sales and cost of sales were reduced by million for the nine months ended september  and million for the full year the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors  including the length of time the receivables are outstanding  the current business environment  and historical experience 
in addition  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection  stock rotation  and obsolescence  as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
the company assesses its investments accounted for as available for sale on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other than temporary 
when the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the period in which it occurs 
the company makes such determination based upon the quoted market price  financial condition  operating results of the investee  and the company s intent and ability to retain the investment over a period of time which would be sufficient to allow for any recovery in market value 
in addition  the company assesses the following factors broad economic factors impacting the investee s industry  publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee  and the cyclical nature of the investee s industry 
the company could potentially have an impairment charge in future periods if  among other factors  the investee s future earnings differ from currently available forecasts 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made 
it is the company s policy to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities 
the company establishes the accruals based upon management s assessment of probable contingencies 
at december   the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable contingencies 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of accruals  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be affected 
the company uses various financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  for purposes other than trading 
derivatives used as part of the company s risk management strategy are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair value hedges and the hedged debt are adjusted to current market values through interest expense 
the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  which is included in the shareholders equity section  and any ineffective portion would be recorded in earnings 
the company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of its net investment hedge on a quarterly basis 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims related to environmental  labor  product  tax  and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or 
table of contents outcomes for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments impacting the probability of a loss  the estimate of such loss  and the probability of recovery of such loss from third parties 
the company has recorded charges in connection with restructuring its businesses  as well as the integration of acquired businesses 
these items primarily include employee separation costs and estimates related to the consolidation of facilities net of sub lease income  contractual obligations  and the valuation of certain assets including accounts receivable  inventories  and investments 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
the costs and obligations of the company s defined benefit pension plan are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
the two critical assumptions used which impact the net periodic pension cost income and the benefit obligation are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate represents the market rate for a high quality corporate bond and the expected return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  historical trends  and expected returns on plan assets 
these key assumptions are evaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts 
the company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  to evaluate goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a weighted average multiple of earnings before interest and taxes from comparable companies 
in determining the fair value  the company makes certain judgments  including the identification of reporting units and the selection of comparable companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of products sold or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports shipping and handling costs  primarily related to outbound freight  in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
if the company included such costs in cost of products sold  gross profit margin as a percentage of sales for would decrease from to with no impact on reported earnings

statement no 
r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of compensation expense recognized be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow  as required under previous accounting guidance 
this requirement may result in a reduction of net operating cash flows and an increase of net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company is not able to estimate the benefits of such tax deductions for future periods as they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
the company s estimate may be impacted by certain variables including  but not limited to  stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors  additional stock option grants  estimates of forfeitures  and related tax impacts 
the company has transitioned to statement no 
r using the modified prospective application and will continue to utilize the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company  as a large global organization  faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company s primary exposure relates to transactions in which the currency collected from customers is different from the currency utilized to purchase the product sold in europe  the asia pacific region  canada  and latin america 
the company s policy is to hedge substantially all such currency exposures for which natural hedges do not exist 
natural hedges exist when purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward  option  or swap contracts collectively  the foreign exchange contracts 
in many regions in asia  for example  sales and purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  resulting in a natural hedge 
natural hedges exist in most countries in which the company operates  although the percentage of natural offsets  as compared with offsets  which need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts  will vary from country to country 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties  which the company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is estimated using market quotes 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amounts  which are nominal  approximated fair value at december  and the translation of the financial statements of the non north american operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in consolidated sales and operating income was impacted by the translation of the company s international financial statements into us dollars which resulted in increased sales of million and increased operating income of million for  compared with the year earlier periods  based on sales at the average rate for sales and operating income would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  if average foreign exchange rates had declined by against the us dollar in this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical foreign exchange rate on the sales and operating income of the company s international operations 
the company entered into a cross currency swap for approximately million or million to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated net assets 
the cross currency swap will also effectively convert the interest expense on million of long term debt from us dollars to euros 
based on the foreign exchange rate at december   the company would expect reduced interest expense of approximately million for the period from october through april date that interest will reset 
as the notional amount of the cross currency swap is expected to equal a comparable amount of hedged net assets  no ineffectiveness is expected 
the cross currency swap had a fair value of 
million at december  interest rate risk the company s interest expense  in part  is sensitive to the general level of interest rates in the americas  europe  and the asia pacific region 
the company historically has managed its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate debt in its total debt portfolio 
in addition  the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   approximately of the company s debt was subject to fixed rates and of its debt was subject to floating rates 
a one percentage point change in average interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense  net of interest income  in this was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate on the company s average floating rate on invested cash and outstanding debt 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the level of overall economic activity that could exist 
in the event of a change in the level of economic activity  which may adversely impact interest rates  the company could likely take actions to further mitigate any potential negative exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that might be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
