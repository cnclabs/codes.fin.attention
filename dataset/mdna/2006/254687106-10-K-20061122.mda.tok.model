revenues cable networks broadcasting segment operating income cable networks broadcasting revenues media networks revenues increased  or billion  to billion  consisting of a increase  or million  at the cable networks and a increase  or million  at broadcasting 
increased cable networks revenues were primarily due to growth of million from cable and satellite operators and million in advertising revenues 
revenues from cable and satellite operators are generally derived from fees charged on a per subscriber basis  and the increase in the current year was due to contractual rate increases and  to a lesser extent subscriber growth at espn 
increased advertising revenue was due to higher ratings and rates at espn 
the company s contractual arrangements with cable and satellite operators are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
certain of these arrangements are currently in negotiation 

table of contents consolidation in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the company s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable and satellite programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place 
if this were to occur  revenues from cable networks could increase at slower rates than in the past or could stabilize or decline 
certain of the company s existing contracts with cable and satellite operators as well as contracts in negotiation include annual live programming commitments 
in these cases  revenues subject to the commitments  which are generally collected ratably over the year  are deferred until the annual commitments are satisfied  which generally results in higher revenue recognition in the second half of the year 
the increase in broadcasting revenues was due to growth at the abc television network and increased sales of touchstone television series 
the growth at the abc television network was primarily due to an increase in primetime advertising revenues resulting from higher rates  strong upfront sales  and continued strength in ratings 
the abc television network also experienced increased advertising revenues from the super bowl  partially offset by lower advertising revenues from the absence of monday night football mnf which moved to espn 
increased sales of touchstone television series reflected higher international syndication and dvd sales of hit dramas lost  grey s anatomy  and desperate housewives  as well as higher third party license fees led by scrubs  which completed its fifth season of network television 
costs and expenses costs and expenses  which consist primarily of programming rights costs  production costs  participation costs  distribution and marketing expenses  labor costs  and general and administrative costs  increased  or billion  to billion consisting of a increase  or million  at the cable networks  and a increase  or million  at broadcasting 
the increase at cable networks was primarily due to increased costs at espn driven by higher programming costs from the new major league baseball mlb and national football league nfl long term license agreements and an additional nfl game 
espn also incurred higher costs for its branded mobile phone services  which the company recently announced would be transitioned into its existing wireless licensing business  and higher general and administrative expenses 
the increase in broadcasting was due to higher programming expenses at the abc television network  increased production and distribution costs related to the sale of touchstone television series  higher costs at the internet operations and radio  and the increased number and costs of pilot productions 
the increase in programming expenses at the abc television network reflected costs related to the super bowl partially offset by the absence of costs from monday night football in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the cost increase at the internet operations was primarily due to the launch of disney branded mobile phone services as well as costs of other new initiatives 
higher costs at radio included an impairment charge related to fcc licenses  primarily associated with espn radio stations  reflecting an overall market decline in certain radio markets in which we operate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
sports programming costs the company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of television rights for sports and other programming  including the national basketball association nba  nfl  mlb  nascar  and various college football and basketball conferences and football bowl games 
the costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years 
we enter into these contractual commitments with the expectation that  over the life of the contracts  revenue from advertising during the programming and affiliate fees will exceed the costs of the programming 
while contract costs may initially exceed incremental revenues and negatively impact operating income  it is our expectation that the combined value to our networks from all of these contracts will result in long term benefits 
the actual impact of these contracts on the company s results over the term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts  and the size of viewer audiences 
in february  the company s nfl contract was extended for an additional three years ending with the telecast of the pro bowl 
the aggregate fee for the three year period was billion 
the implementation of the contract extension resulted in a million reduction in nfl programming costs at espn in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of this decrease was in the first quarter of fiscal these costs were relatively level in fiscal and cash payments under the contract were billion for fiscal and billion for both fiscal and 
table of contents in april  the company entered into a new agreement with the nfl for the right to broadcast nfl monday night football games on espn

the payment terms of the new contract provide for average increases in the annual payments of approximately per year 
our expense recognition of the costs of the new contract reflect this payment schedule 
the company has rights to games in the season  which began in the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year segment operating income segment operating income increased  or million  to billion for the year due to an increase of million at the cable networks and an increase of million at broadcasting

studio entertainment revenues revenues decreased  or million  to billion primarily due to a decrease of million in worldwide home entertainment partially offset by an increase of million in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution  and an increase of million in music distribution 
lower worldwide home entertainment revenues were primarily due to a decline in unit sales resulting from a higher number of strong performing titles in the prior year partially offset by increased sales of television dvd box sets and reduced marketing and trade programs 
significant current year titles included the chronicles of narnia the lion  the witch and the wardrobe  cinderella platinum release  and chicken little  while prior year titles included disney pixar s the incredibles  national treasure  aladdin platinum release  and bambi platinum release 
the increase in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution revenues was primarily due to the strong box office performance of pirates of the caribbean dead man s chest  the chronicles of narnia the lion  the witch and the wardrobe  and disney pixar s cars compared to the prior year titles  which included the incredibles and national treasure

the increase in fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations 
the discount rate assumption decreased from to  reflecting trends in prevailing market interest rates at our june  valuation date 

table of contents we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to decrease to million in fiscal with approximately one half of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment 
the decrease is primarily due to an increase in the discount rate assumption from to  reflecting increases in prevailing market interest rates on our june  valuation date 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
the company s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves 
during fiscal  the company contributed approximately million to its pension and postretirement medical plans  which included voluntary contributions above the minimum requirements for the pension plans 
based on the january  funding valuation  the company is not required to make any contributions to its pension plans during fiscal the company currently expects to contribute  at a minimum  million to its pension and postretirement medical plans during fiscal the company may make additional contributions into its pension plans in fiscal depending on how the funded status of those plans change and as we gain more clarity with respect to the pension protection act of ppa that was signed into law on august  the united states treasury department is in the process of developing implementation guidance for the ppa  however  it is likely the ppa will accelerate minimum funding requirements beginning in fiscal the company may choose to pre fund some of this anticipated funding 
pension obligations exceed plan assets for a number of our pension plans 
in this situation  the accounting rules require that we record an additional minimum pension liability 
the minimum pension liability adjustment at year end fiscal and fiscal is as follows in millions minimum liability at fiscal year end decrease in pretax aftertax the decrease in the minimum pension liability in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in the discount rate from to 
the accounting rules do not require that changes in the additional minimum pension liability adjustment be recorded in current period earnings  but rather they are recorded directly to equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
expense recognition under the pension accounting rules is based upon long term trends over the expected life of the company s workforce

table of contents capital expenditures for the parks and resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion  new rides and attractions and recurring capital and capital improvements 
the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to lower investment at hong kong disneyland resulting from substantial completion of the park prior to its opening in september  as well as lower expenditures at the domestic theme parks due to increased investment in the prior year in preparation for the disneyland th anniversary celebration 
capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers  production facilities  and television station facilities

we believe that the company s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control 
in addition to macroeconomic factors  the company s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which are based  in significant part  on the company s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of september   moody s investors service s long and short term debt ratings for the company were a and p  respectively  with stable outlook  and standard poor s long and short term debt ratings for the company were a and a  respectively  with stable outlook 
the company s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant  relating to interest coverage  which the company met on september   by a significant margin 
the company s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities  such as euro disney and hong kong disneyland  from any representations  covenants  or events of default 
beginning in fiscal year  hong kong disneyland is subject to semi annual financial performance covenants under its commercial term loan and revolving credit facility agreement 
the commercial term loan had a balance of approximately million on september  the revolving credit facility has not been drawn on to date 
in july  lenders under the commercial term loan and revolving credit facility agreement provided a waiver to these covenants for the september  and march  measurement dates 
the revolving credit facility will not be available for the period the waiver is in effect unless the covenants are  in fact  satisfied during the period 
the covenants will be in effect for the september  measurement date 

table of contents euro disney has covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investing and financing activities 
beginning with fiscal year  euro disney must also meet financial performance covenants that necessitate earnings growth 
as a result of revenue growth in excess of increases in costs and expenses during fiscal year  management believes that euro disney is in compliance with the covenants for fiscal pursuant to the debt agreements  compliance with the covenants is subject to final third party confirmation 
there can be no assurance that the covenants referred to in the prior two paragraphs will be met for any particular measurement period 
to the extent that conditions are such that the covenants appear unlikely to be met  management would pursue measures to meet the covenants  including increasing revenues or reducing expenses  or would seek to obtain waivers from the debt holders 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
for example  the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at september  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings

legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters 
accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
film and television revenues and costs we expense the cost of film and television productions over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period s gross revenues to the estimated remaining total gross revenues ultimate revenues for each production 
if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases  amortization of film and television costs will be accelerated 
conversely  if estimates of ultimate revenues increase  film and television cost amortization will be slowed 
for film productions  ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years of the date of the initial theatrical release 
for television series  we include revenues that will be earned within ten years of the delivery of the first episode  or if still in production  five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode  if later 
for acquired film libraries  remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to twenty years from the date of acquisition 
with respect to films intended for theatrical release  the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues and therefore affecting film cost amortization and or impairment is domestic theatrical performance 
revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release eg the home video or international theatrical markets have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance 
domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film  the quality of competing films at the time of release  as well as the level of marketing effort 
upon a film s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance  the company s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships 
the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved 
home entertainment sales vary based on the volume and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products 
with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast  the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program s rating 
program ratings  which are an indication of market acceptance  directly affect the company s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program 
in addition  television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental 
table of contents revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in syndication 
alternatively  poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation  which would require the immediate write off of any unamortized production costs 
we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies  series  and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired 
amortization of these television programming assets is accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings 
the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program s ratings in previous airings  expected advertising rates  and availability and quality of alternative programming 
accordingly  planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary 
rights costs for multi year sports programming arrangements are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period s gross revenues to ultimate revenues the projected revenue method or on a straight line basis  as appropriate 
gross revenues include both advertising revenues and an allocation of affiliate fees 
if the annual contractual payments related to each season over the term of a multi year sports programming arrangement approximate each season s rights cost based on the projected revenue method  we expense the related annual payments during the applicable season 
if ultimate revenues change significantly from projections  rights costs amortization may be accelerated or slowed 
costs of film and television productions and programming rights for our broadcast businesses and cable networks are subject to valuation adjustments pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology 
a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type 
the company s dayparts are early morning  daytime  late night  primetime  news  children  and sports includes network and cable 
the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel 
estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  film  television  and programming cost write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies 
we record reductions to home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives 
these estimates are based upon historical return experience  current economic trends  and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products 
if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period  we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount 
conversely  if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period  we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated 
revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used 
for non expiring  multi day tickets  we recognize revenue over a three year time period based on estimated usage patterns  which are derived from historical usage patterns 
a change in these estimated usage patterns could have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition 
pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover  and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower 
table of contents discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we increased our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions at our june  measurement date 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
the company s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense for fiscal by million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october  by million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease these amounts by million and million  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
our long term expected return on plan assets was in both and  respectively 
a one percentage point change in the long term return on pension plan asset assumption would impact fiscal annual pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million

goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and investments statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as required by sfas  goodwill is allocated to various reporting units  which are generally one reporting level below the operating segment 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flow corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate 
the factor most sensitive to change with respect to our discounted cash flow analyses is the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit which is  in turn  sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses 
if actual revenue growth and or margins are lower than our expectations  the impairment test results could differ 
a present value technique was not used to determine the fair value of the television network  a business within the television broadcasting reporting unit within the media networks operating segment 
to determine the fair value of the television network  we used a revenue multiple  as a present value technique would not capture the full fair value of the television network and there is little comparable market data available due to the scarcity of television networks 
if there were a publicly disclosed sale of a comparable network  this may provide better market information with which to estimate the value of the television network and could impact our impairment assessment 
we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of the reporting units 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  the impairment test results could differ 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples  or appraised values as appropriate 

table of contents the company has cost and equity investments 
the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of our investees 
if these forecasts are not met  impairment charges may be required 
we completed our impairment testing as of september   which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million related to certain fcc licenses  primarily associated with espn radio stations  reflecting an overall market decline in certain radio markets in which we operate 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 
income tax audits as a matter of course  the company is regularly audited by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments 
the internal revenue service has commenced its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for through during fiscal  the company settled certain state income tax disputes and released million in related tax reserves that were no longer required 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reached settlements with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to its federal income tax returns for through  and a settlement with the california franchise tax board regarding assessments proposed with respect to its state tax returns for through these favorable settlements resulted in the company releasing million in tax reserves which were no longer required with respect to the settled matters 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the favorable resolution of a tax matter resulted in the release of million in tax reserves 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to its federal income tax returns for through the favorable settlement resulted in the company releasing million in tax reserves that were no longer required with respect to the settled matters 
stock option compensation expense each year during the second quarter  the company awards stock options and restricted stock units to a broad based group of management and creative personnel the annual grant 
prior to the fiscal annual grant  the fair value of options granted was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
beginning with the fiscal annual grant  the company has changed to the binomial valuation model 
the binomial valuation model considers certain characteristics of fair value option pricing that are not considered under the black scholes model 
similar to the black scholes model  the binomial valuation model takes into account variables such as volatility  dividend yield  and the risk free interest rate 
however  the binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average and the termination rate the probability of a vested option being cancelled due to the termination of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
accordingly  the company believes that the binomial valuation model should produce a fair value that is more representative of the value of an employee option 

table of contents in fiscal years   and  the weighted average assumptions used in the options pricing models were as follows risk free interest rate expected term years expected volatility dividend yield termination rate n a n a exercise multiple n a n a commencing with the annual grant  the company utilized the binomial valuation model 
the company utilized the black scholes model during fiscal and fiscal although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date  changes in the company s assumptions may change the value and therefore  the expense related to future stock option grants 
the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the assumed volatility and expected exercise multiple 
increases or decreases in either the assumed volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease  respectively 
the volatility assumption for fiscal and considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the company s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions 
volatility for fiscal was estimated based upon historical share price volatility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
if the assumed volatility of used by the company during was increased or decreased by percentage points ie to or to  the weighted average binomial value of our stock option grants would have increased by or decreased by  respectively 
the expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the company s future stock performance  stock price volatility  and employee turnover rates 
if the exercise multiple assumption of used by the company during were increased to or decreased to  the weighted average binomial value of our stock option grants would have increased by or decreased by  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of pixar on may   the company converted previously issued vested and unvested pixar stock based awards into disney stock based awards consisting of million stock options and one million rsus 
the fair value of these awards was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  as the information required to use the binomial valuation model was not reasonably available 
the methodology utilized to determine the assumptions in the black scholes model was consistent with that used by the company for its option pricing models 
accounting changes sab in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab must be implemented by the end of the company s fiscal the company is currently assessing the potential effect of sab on its financial statements

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying fin at adoption  if any  is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption

r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
variable interest entities vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
all vies with which the company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currencies  and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company s portfolio of borrowings 
by policy  the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments  and forecasted foreign currency 
table of contents revenues 
the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  transactions 
the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro  british pound  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
cross currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowings 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk var the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange  and market sensitive equity financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates  currencies  and equity prices a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate  foreign currency  and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal year end 
the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
var on a combined basis was million at september  and october  the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  is as follows unaudited  in millions fiscal year interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var average var highest var lowest var beginning of year var year end fiscal the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of september  in calculating the var it was determined that credit risks are the primary driver for changes in the value of euro disney s debt rather than interest rate risks 
accordingly  we have excluded euro disney s borrowings from the above var calculation
