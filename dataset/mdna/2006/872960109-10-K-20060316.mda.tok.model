international operations although we generate revenues in of the countries that we operate in our international services division  as of december  we have yet to generate positive operating cash flows in six of these countries 
when establishing operations in a country  we typically incur personnel and capital expenditures for an average of two to three years prior to establishing a customer base  recording revenues and generating positive operating cash flows 
on a consolidated basis as of december   our international services division generated positive operating cash flows 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the selected statements of operations data in thousands year ended december  statements of operations data revenues cost of network services engineering and development selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses income from operations before income tax provision and equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates interest expense interest and other income expense  net income tax provision equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates net loss income year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we generate revenues through four operating divisions 
pos division 
revenues from the pos division decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in pos revenues resulted primarily from a decline in transaction volumes  primarily from a major customer  and to a lesser extent a decrease in revenue per transaction as a result of negotiated price reductions upon renewal of certain contracts 
pos transaction volumes decreased to billion transactions for the year ended december   from billion transactions for the year ended december  we have negotiated contract renewals with some of our pos customers  and in several instances we agreed to pricing discounts in exchange for maintaining or increasing their minimum transaction or revenue commitments 
as a result  it is likely our revenue per transaction will decrease and  depending upon the number of transactions we transport  our pos revenues may continue to decrease 
in addition  during we amended our contract with a major customer to extend the term of the agreement for two years 
the amended contract does not contain any minimum transaction commitments 
based on the amended contract  we believe that revenues and related transaction volumes from this customer may decline in and thereafter 
international services division 
revenues from the international services division increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to additional revenues generated from our pos and fsd customers in the united kingdom  australia  france  germany  ireland and italy

financial services division

cost of network services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  cost of network services were of revenues for the year ended december   compared to of revenues for the year ended december  the increase in cost of network services resulted primarily from higher usage charges from our tsd  fsd and isd services  offset primarily by lower usage charges from decreased pos transactions and to a lesser extent  a decrease in usage based vendor telecommunications charges in our pos division 
gross profit represented of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues resulted primarily from increased contribution of our international services division and financial services division  our highest gross margin divisions  and to a lesser extent the decrease in usage based vendor telecommunications charges 
these increases were partially offset by the decline in margin of our pos business as we transported fewer transactions over our fixed cost network  as well as from increased contribution from our telecommunications services division  our lowest gross margin division 
future cost of network services depends on a number of factors including total transaction and query volume  the relative growth and contribution to total transaction volume of each of our customers  the success of our new service offerings  the timing and extent of our network expansion and the timing and extent of any network cost reductions 
in addition  any significant loss or significant reduction in transaction volumes could lead to a decline in gross margin since significant portions of our network costs are fixed costs 
engineering and development expense 
engineering and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  engineering and development expense represented of revenues for the year ended december  and of revenues for the year ended december  engineering and development expense increased primarily from an increase in engineering expenses required to support our international expansion and new product offerings in our pos division

excluding these items  amortization of intangible assets decreased due to certain of our intangible assets becoming fully amortized during for purposes of measuring and recognizing impairment of long lived assets including intangibles  we assess whether separate cash flows can be attributed to the individual asset 
for our customer relationship intangible assets  we recognize and measure impairment upon the significant loss of revenue from a customer 
based upon our contract with one of our major customers  we believe that revenues and related transaction volumes from this customer will continue to decline in and may decline further thereafter 
the intangible asset value attributable to this customer relationship is approximately million as of december  we assessed the recoverability of this customer relationship asset based upon undiscounted anticipated future cash flows  and concluded no impairment existed as of december  interest expense

we will continue to assess the recoverability of our customer relationship assets based upon undiscounted anticipated future cash flows

seasonality credit card and debit card transactions account for a major percentage of the transaction volume processed by our customers 
the volume of these transactions on our networks generally is greater in the third and fourth quarter vacation and holiday seasons than during the rest of the year 
consequently  revenues and earnings from credit card and debit card transactions in the first and second quarter generally are lower than revenues and earnings from credit card and debit card transactions in the third and fourth quarters of the immediately preceding year 
we expect that our operating results in the foreseeable future will be significantly affected by seasonal trends in the credit card and debit card transaction market 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance the costs of our operations  to make capital expenditures and to service our debt 
the borrowings under our amended and restated senior secured credit facility were used to finance the stock repurchase on may   as well as to repay the amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
the proceeds from our initial public offering in march  along with the proceeds from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
based upon our current level of operations  we expect that our cash flow from operations  together with the amounts we are able to borrow under our amended and restated senior secured credit facility  will be adequate to meet our anticipated needs for the foreseeable future 
although we have no specific plans to do so  to the extent we decide to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions  we will likely need to incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions

the amended and restated senior secured credit facility consists of a million term loan and a revolving credit facility of million  under which there were no borrowings as of december  the amended and restated senior secured credit facility matures may  payments on the term loan are due in quarterly installments over the seven year term  beginning on june   with the remainder payable on may  voluntary prepayments on the term loan are first applied pro rata to the scheduled quarterly installments due within the next succeeding twelve month period until paid in full and then applied to the term loan in inverse order of maturity 
as of december  total remaining payments on the term loan are as follows in thousands thereafter for the period through december   borrowings on the revolving credit facility and the term loan bore interest at a rate of percent over the libor rate percent as of december  
thereafter  if we achieve a leverage ratio of less than  the borrowings on the revolving credit facility and the term loan generally will bear interest at a rate  at our option  of either percent over the lender s base rate or percent over the libor rate 
our leverage ratio as of december  was to the revolving credit facility is subject to an annual non use commitment fee in an amount equal to percent or percent per annum  depending on our leverage ratio  multiplied by the amount of funds available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
interest payments on the amended and restated senior secured credit facility are due monthly  bimonthly  or quarterly at our option 
the terms of the amended and restated senior secured credit facility require us to comply with financial and nonfinancial covenants  including maintaining certain leverage  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter

our future results of operations and our ability to comply with the covenants could be adversely impacted by increases in the general level of interest rates since the interest on a majority of our debt is variable 
noncompliance with any of the financial or nonfinancial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the amended and restated senior secured credit facility 
an event of default resulting from a breach of a financial or nonfinancial covenant may result  at the option of the lenders  in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding  and a termination of the amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility

the lease provides for quarterly payments in equal installments of approximately  and expires on september  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies related to revenue and related cost recognition  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets and accounting for income taxes to be critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
critical accounting policies include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
revenues and related cost recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the terms are fixed or determinable  services are performed  and collection is probable 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
pos services revenue is derived primarily from the transmission of transaction data through our networks between payment processors and pos or atm terminals 
telecommunication services revenue is derived primarily from fixed monthly recurring fees for our call signaling services and per query fees charged for our database access and validation services 
financial services revenue is derived primarily from monthly recurring fees based on the number of customer connections to and through our networks 
customer incentives granted to new customers or upon contract renewals are deferred and recognized ratably as a reduction of revenue over the contract period to the extent that the incentives are recoverable against the customer s minimum purchase commitments under the contract 
in addition  we receive installation fees related to the configuration of the customer s systems 
revenue from installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the customer s contractual service period  generally three years 
we perform periodic evaluations of our customer base and establish allowances for estimated credit losses 
cost of network services is comprised primarily of telecommunications charges  which include data transmission and database access  leased digital capacity charges  circuit installation charges and activation charges 
the cost of data transmission is based on a contract or tariff rate per minute of usage in addition to a prescribed rate per transaction for certain vendors 
the costs of database access  circuits  installation charges and activation charges are based on fixed fee contracts with local exchange carriers and interexchange carriers 
the cost of network services also includes salaries  equipment maintenance and other costs related to the ongoing operation of our data networks 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we record our accrual for telecommunications charges based upon network services utilized at historical invoiced rates 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests 
we have elected to perform the impairment test annually as of october of each year 
an interim goodwill impairment test is performed if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired  we perform a recoverability evaluation based upon a determination of fair value 
in accordance with sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets including property and equipment  capitalized software development costs and identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine the recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future estimated undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
if we estimate that the assets are impaired  the assets are written down to their fair value 
for purposes of measuring and recognizing impairment of long lived assets  we assess whether separate cash flows can be attributed to the individual asset 
we group our long lived assets by business unit where separately identifiable cash flows are available 
in the event that long lived assets  including intangibles are abandoned or otherwise disposed of  we recognize an impairment charge upon disposition 
for our customer relationship intangible assets  we evaluate impairment upon the significant loss of revenue from a customer 
the calculation of fair value in accordance with sfas nos 
and includes a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
our estimates of anticipated future income and cash flows used in determining fair value could be reduced significantly in the future due to changes in technologies  regulation  available financing  competition or other circumstances 
as a result  the carrying amount of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
additionally  changes in estimated future cash flows could result in a shortening of estimated useful lives for long lived assets including intangibles 
income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate 
we provide a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax expense or benefits are based upon the changes in the asset or liability from period to period 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   provides for a temporary percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate percent federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by the company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
during the year ended december   we decided to repatriate and ultimately did repatriate  million of foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of accordingly  we recorded an additional income tax provision of approximately million related to this decision 
we intend to reinvest the remaining undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely and  therefore  no provision for us income taxes has been provided against these undistributed earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recorded as an expense based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
information about the fair value of stock options under the black scholes model and its pro forma impact on its net income loss and basic and diluted net income loss per common share for the years ended december   and which may differ from the ultimate impact of adopting the new standard can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include the modified prospective or the modified retrospective adoption methods 
under the modified retrospective method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the modified retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to result in additional stock compensation expense  and therefore a reduction of net income for the year ending december   of approximately million to million 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
previously  voluntary changes in accounting principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
in addition  fsp includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and adds a footnote to apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
fsp also nullifies certain requirements of emerging issue task force no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the effective date for this fsp is reporting periods beginning after december  we have not yet determined if the adoption of fsp will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of intangible assets and goodwill  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and costs of network services  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our amended and restated senior secured credit facility with interest rates tied to changes in the lender s base rate or the libor rate 
based upon the outstanding borrowings on december  and assuming repayment of the term loan in accordance with scheduled maturities  each increase in these rates could add an additional million to our annual interest expense 
as of december   we did not hold derivative financial or commodity instruments and all of our cash and cash equivalents were held in money market or commercial accounts 
foreign currency risk our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared with foreign currencies  predominately the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar due to our operations in europe and australia 
we have operations in countries outside of the us  including the united kingdom  australia  canada  france  germany  ireland  italy  japan  the netherlands  new zealand  poland  romania  south korea  spain and sweden 
we provide services in these countries using networks deployed in each country 
we manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of our business 
in the substantial majority of our transactions  we receive payments denominated in the us dollar  british pound  euro or australian dollar 
therefore  we do not rely on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies 
the foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid according to our standard payment terms  which are generally short term in nature 
our policy is not to speculate in foreign currencies  and we promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables  which are denominated in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss on foreign currency translation of approximately million
