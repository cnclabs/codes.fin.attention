the excess cash is invested daily in overnight fed funds 
the average balance of these funds that earn interest was million in the increase in the balance of cash and cash equivalents at year end was primarily due to larger balances maintained with the federal reserve bank along with pending funding needs

afs investment securities represent of average earning assets during and are primarily comprised of government secured agency bonds and government secured mortgaged backed securities  capital trust security issues of regional banks  domestic corporate debt and us denominated foreign corporate debt 
at december   afs investment securities were million as compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to maturities and principal payments from mortgage backed securities from the existing portfolio 
loans 
royal bancshares primary earning assets are loans  representing approximately of average earning assets during the loan portfolio is comprised primarily of business demand loans and commercial mortgages secured by real estate and to a significantly lesser extent  residential loans comprised of one to four family residential and home equity loans 
during  total loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to an increased lending staff and products along with the addition of the royal asian bank division 
allowance for loan losses 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
management determines the allowance for loan losses with the objective of maintaining a reserve level sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management has determined the company s balance in the allowance for loan losses based on management s detailed analysis and review of loan portfolio 
management considers all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectibility 
the periodic analysis and review includes an evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to historical loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
management s evaluation is inherently subjective and all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management s the company may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
during  the allowance for loan loss decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the million charge to allowance was attributed to a loan the company had in texas 
the level of allowance for loan loss reserve represents approximately of total loans at december  versus at december  as of december  the company had four loans in the amount of million that are considered to be potential problem loans with a specific reserve of million 
the decrease in the percentage in the allowance was related to the million charge off as well as an increase in the balance of outstanding loans of approximately million 
management believes that  based on information currently available  including the potential problem loans  the allowance for loan loss is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  no assurances can be given that the level of allowance will be sufficient to cover future loan losses or that future adjustments to the allowance will be sufficient to cover future loan losses or that future adjustments to the allowance will not be necessary if economic and or other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the current level of the allowance

lease financing foreign unallocated n a  n a an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
deposits 
royal bancshares deposits are an important source of funding 
total deposits decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease in deposits is primarily due to a financial benefit from allowing money market accounts to be replaced by overnight borrowings 
at december   brokered deposits were million as compared to million at december  certificate of deposit accounts increased million  or from million at december  to million at december  the increase in brokered deposits and certificates of deposits was primarily due to the million investment strategy and use of these deposits to fund increased loan demand 
other deposit categories comprised of demand  now  money markets and savings deposits decreased million during over their levels at december  the decrease in all savings categories is primarily due to a reduction in interest rates offered 
fhlb borrowings 
borrowings are comprised of long term borrowings advances and short term borrowings overnight borrowings  advances 
long term fhlb borrowings increased million to million at december  from million at december  due to converting overnight borrowings to long tern borrowings which allowed royal bancshares to take advantage of the flat yield curve by locking in interest rates 
at december  short term fhlb borrowings were million 
the average balance of borrowings during was million versus million for other borrowings 
royal bancshares previous completed a private placement of trust preferred securities in the aggregate amount of million for a term of years with a call feature of years 
in addition  as result of the adoption of fin r royal bancshares consolidated into its statement of condition million of debt related to real estate equity investment of which is guaranteed by royal bancshares 
other liabilities 
during  royal bancshares increased its unfunded pension obligation by thousand as a result to modification the pension plan  increased it profit sharing obligation by  and third quarter posting to from its posting an expense for the fair value of derivatives 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity increased million or in to million primarily due to net income of million partially offset by million in cash dividends paid in additionally  shareholders equity was affected by the decrease in market value of afs investment securities during  which resulted in a downward adjustment of million 
results of operations general 
royal bancshares results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets consist principally of loans and investment securities  while interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits 
net income is also affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest income as well as by non interest expenses  including salary and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other operating expenses 
net income 
net income in was million as compared to million in and million in basic earnings per share were  and for   and  respectively 
the million increase in net income for represents a increase over  and is primarily attributable to the sale of two apartment complex which royal bancshares held an equity ownership in 
this transaction was disclosed through a form k filing on october  the million increase in net income for represents an increase over and was primarily due to an increase in non interest income specifically with income from bank owned life insurance and gains from the disposition of other real estate owned 
net interest income 
net interest income is royal bancshares primary source of income 
its level is a function of the average balance of interest earning assets  the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  and the spread between the yield on assets and liabilities 
in turn  these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of royal bancshares interest earning assets and funding sources 
additionally  net interest income is affected by market and economic conditions  which influence rates on loan and deposit growth 
net interest income was million in as compared to million in the increase in net interest income in of million was primarily due an increase in both the average balance and yield on earning assets along with a one time exit fee in the amount of million collected during the second quarter of the decrease in from of net interest income of million is primarily due to the reduction of the yield on earning assets along with a decline in the spread of earning assets as compared to costing liabilities in loans and mortgages average loan outstandings    interest and fees on loans    average yield royal bancshares continues to originate both fixed rate and variable rate loans 
at december  variable rate loans represented of total loans 
together with some match funding of fixed rate deposits to fixed rate loans  variable rate loans have helped royal bancshares manage interest rate risk 
in  the average balance of loans increased million to million in  primarily due an increase in the lending staff  offering additional lending products and the addition of the royal asian division 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points in primarily due to the increases in the prime rate and the million exit fee collected in the second quarter in in  the average balance of loans decreased million to million primarily due a large amount of loans being paid off as interest rates remained at historically low levels 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points in primarily due to the average loan run off being at a lower yield than the average yield  along with the federal reserve increasing the short term rates in the second half of htm investment securities average htm investment securities    interest income    average yield htm investment securities are comprised primarily of taxable corporate debt issues and us government agencies 
the corporate debt issues are investment grade at the time of purchase 
it is royal bancshares expressed intention to hold these securities to maturity 
in  the yield on htm investment securities decreased basis points to from in this decrease was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of us government agency bonds held during the year 
the government bonds were purchased with lower yields 
in  the yield on htm investment securities decreased basis points to from in this decrease was primarily due to the purchasing of low credit risk government agency bonds that were yielding to 
the government agency bonds at december  have step up and or call features 
afs investment securities average afs investment securities    interest and dividend income    average yield afs investment securities are comprised primarily of government secured mortgage backed securities  government agency bonds  non rated and rated capital trust security issues of regional banks  rated domestic and us denominated foreign corporate debt securities and to a lesser extent preferred and common stock 
in  the average balance of afs investment securities decreased million to million primarily due to maturities and the repayment of principal from the existing mortgaged backed securities 
the basis point increase in average yield is primarily due to the lower yield on the principal repayments 
in  the average balance of afs investment securities decreased million to million primarily due to classifying new purchases from investment runoff as held to maturity 
the basis point increase in average yield is primarily due to higher yields earned on mortgage back securities resulting from slower principal repayments speeds 
interest expense on now and money market deposits average now money market deposits    interest expense    average cost of funds in  the average cost of funds on now and money market deposits increased basis points to from in primarily due to increasing rates as a result of federal reserve increasing the overnight rates during the year 
in  the average cost of funds on now and money market deposits decreased basis points to from in primarily due to a decline in the interest rate paid on these deposits 
interest expense on time deposits average time deposits    interest expense    average cost of funds in  the average balance of time deposits increased million to million 
the increase in average time deposits is primarily due to the million brokered deposit used in investment strategy 
in  the average balance of time deposits decreased million to million 
this decrease in average time deposits is primarily due to the maturity of higher yielding brokered deposits 
although short term rates in general continued to move upward in  the long term rates continued to remain flat causing the yield on term deposits to remain the same 
at december   of time deposits were comprised of certificates of deposits accounts with balances of  or more  while in  of time deposits were comprised of certificates of deposit accounts with balances of  or more 
these types of deposit have traditionally been considered more rate volatile than other types of deposits  however royal bank s penalty for early redemption somewhat mitigates this volatility 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for loan losses is an amount charged to expense to provide for future losses on existing loans 
in order to determine the amount of the provision for loan loss  royal bank conducts a quarterly review of the loan portfolio to evaluate overall credit quality 
this evaluation consists of an analysis of individual loans and overall risk characteristics and size of the loan  and takes into consideration current economic and market conditions  changes in non performing loans  the capability of specific borrowers to repay loan obligations as well as current collateral values 
during  a provision for loan losses was recorded for thousand  as compared to the thousand in both provisions were due to charge offs relating to delinquent tax liens held by crusader servicing corporation 
management determined that no additional provision was needed based on its analysis of the reserve for possible loan losses according to documentation required under sab net charge offs were million in as compared to net recoveries thousand in in  a provision for loan losses was recorded for thousand  as compared to thousand in due to charges off s relating to delinquent tax liens 
during senior management determined that loan loss reserve was adequate and no additional provision was required for the period 
net recoveries were thousand in as compared to net charge offs of thousand in non interest income non interest income includes service charges on depositors accounts  safe deposit rentals and various services such as cashing checks  issuing money orders and traveler s checks  and similar activities 
in addition  other forms of non interest income are derived from changes in the cash value of boli  fees collected on the sale of residential mortgages in the secondary market and income relating to the vie s which royal bank has an investment 
most components of non interest income are a modest and stable source of income  with exceptions of one time gains and losses from the sale of investments securities and other real estate owned  from period to period these sources of income may vary considerably 
service charges on depositors accounts  safe deposit rentals and other fees are periodically reviewed by management to remain competitive with other local banks 
in  total non interest income increased million to to million at december  this increase is primarily due the sale of two apartment complexes resulting in a pretax gain of million from royal bancshares investment in vie s 
this was partially offset by a reduction of million due to the deconsolidation of the vie s in which royal bancshares interest was sold 
in  total non interest income increased million to million at december  this increase is primarily due income earned on the purchase of boli  income related to the consolidation of the vies and the sale of other real estate owned 
non interest expense non interest expense includes compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  advertising  fdic insurance  state taxes  depreciation  and other expenses such as auditing  automatic teller machines atms  data processing  legal  outside service charges  postage  printing and other expenses relating to other real estate owned 
effective  royal bancshares through the adoption of fin r consolidates the expenses related to equity investments 
non interest expenses decreased thousand to million in  from million in salaries and benefits increased million primarily due to the increased in the lending staff and royal asian division  an increase to the company s profit sharing plan due to the results for the year  and a one time charge of approximately million related to modifications to the company s pension plan 
expenses related to equity investments decreased million during this was primarily due to the deconsolidation of three vie s during the second and fourth quarters 
during  the company has taken some one time charges  thousand for the decline in the fair value of interest rate swaps and thousand for an asset write down 
non interest expense increased million to million in  from million in salaries and employee benefits increased thousand to million in  from million in this was primarily due to annual salary increases and the addition of the royal asian bank  a division of royal bank 
occupancy expense increased thousand to million in primarily due to the addition royal asian bank 
other operating expenses increased thousand to million in as a result of consolidation of the vie non interest expense increased million during accounting for income taxes the provision for federal income taxes was million in as compared to million for  and million for representing an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
during  a million reduction in tax expense was recorded as a result of the completion of an irs audit  with respect to a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset derived from net operating loss carryovers 
accounting for debt and equity securities royal bancshares accounts for investment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this standard requires investments in securities to be classified in one of three categories  held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
debt securities that royal bancshares has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
as royal bancshares does not engage in security trading  the balance of its debt securities and any equity securities are classified as available for sale 
net unrealized gains and losses for such securities  net of tax effect  are required to be recognized as a separate component of shareholders equity and excluded from the determination of net income 
asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this process is overseen by the asset liability committee alco which monitors and controls  among other variables  the liquidity  balance sheet structure and interest rate risk of the consolidated company within policy parameters established and outlined in the alco policy which are reviewed by the board of directors at least annually 
additionally  the alco committee meets periodically and reports on liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and projects financial performance in various interest rate scenarios 
liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of the financial institution to ensure that adequate funds will be available to meet its financial commitments as they become due 
in managing its liquidity position  the financial institution evaluates all sources of funds  the largest of which is deposits 
also taken into consideration is the repayment of loans 
these sources provide the financial institution with alternatives to meet its short term liquidity needs 
longer term liquidity needs may be met by issuing longer term deposits and by raising additional capital 
royal bancshares generally maintains a liquidity ratio equal to or greater than of total deposits and short term liabilities 
liquidity is specifically defined as the ratio of net cash  short term and marketable assets to net deposits and short term liabilities 
the liquidity ratio for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
management believes that royal bancshares liquidity position continues to be adequate  continues to be in excess of its peer group level and meets or exceeds the liquidity target set forth in the asset liability management policy 
management believes that due to its financial position  it will be able to raise deposits as needed to meet liquidity demands 
however  any financial institution could have unmet liquidity demands at any time 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  less than more than in thousands total year years years years fhlb advances     operating leases   interest rate swaps   commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit   subordinated debt   time deposits      total      interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the financial institution s assets and liabilities 
these include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
the interest sensitivity report examines the positioning of the interest rate risk exposure in a changing interest rate environment 
ideally the rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be maintained in a matched position to minimize interest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis is an important management tool  however  it does have some inherent shortcomings 
it is a static analysis 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given period 
the following table summarizes repricing intervals for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   and the difference or gap between them on an actual and cumulative basis for the periods indicated 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
at december   royal bancshares is in an asset sensitive positive of million  which indicates assets will reprice somewhat faster than liabilities within one year

reflects principal maturing within the specified periods for fixed and repricing for variable rate loans  includes nonperforming loans 
the method of analysis of interest rate sensitivity in the table above has a number of limitations 
certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in interest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same time periods 
the interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different times than changes in market interest rates  with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates 
also  certain assets have provisions  which limit changes in interest rates each time the interest rate changes and for the entire term of the loan 
additionally  prepayments and withdrawals experienced in the event of a change in interest rates may deviate significantly from those assumed in the interest rate sensitivity table 
additionally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
capital adequacy the table shown below sets forth royal bancshares consolidated capital level and performance ratios regulatory minimum capital level leverage ratio risk based capital ratio tier total capital performance return on average assets return on average equity royal bancshares sources of capital have been derived from the issuance of stock as well as retained earnings 
while royal bancshares has not had a stock offering since  total shareholders equity has increased primarily due to steady increases in retained earnings 
at december   royal bancshares had an average equity to average asset ratio of 
royal bancshares has no current plans to raise capital through new stock offerings and indeed  seeks ways to leverage its existing capital 
the capital ratios set forth above compare favorably to the minimum required amounts of tier and total capital to risk weighted assets and the minimum tier leverage ratio  as defined by the banking regulators 
at december   royal bancshares was required to have minimum tier and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
in order for royal bancshares to be considered well capitalized  as defined by the banking regulators  royal bancshares must have tier and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
at december   royal bancshares met the criteria for a well capitalized institution  and management believes that  under current regulations  royal bancshares will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk a simulation model is used to estimate the impact of various changes  both upward and downward  in market interest rates and volumes of assets and liabilities on the net income 
this model produces an interest rate exposure report that forecast changes in the market value of portfolio equity under alternative interest rate environment 
the market value of portfolio is defined as the present value of existing assets and liabilities 
the calculated estimates of changes in the market value of portfolio value are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands market value of percent of changes in rates portfolio equity change basis points  basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  the assumptions used in evaluating the vulnerability of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates are based on management s considerations of past experience  current position and anticipated future economic conditions 
the interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from what the calculations may be based 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investors eitf  and in march  the eitf issued an update 
eitf addresses the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain debt and equity securities 
eitf aids in the determination of impairment of an investment and gives guidance as to the measurement of impairment loss and the recognition and disclosures of other than temporary investments 
eitf also provides a model to determine other than temporary impairment using evidence based judgment about the recovery of the fair value up to the cost of the investment by considering the severity and duration of the impairment in relation to the forecasted recovery of the fair value 
in july  fasb adopted the recommendation of its staff to nullify key parts of eitf the staff s recommendations were to nullify the guidance on the determination of whether an investment is impaired as set forth in paragraphs of issue and not to provide additional guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment

the statement requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable 
sfas also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas replaces apb opinion  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  management currently believes that adoption of the provisions of sfas will not have a material impact on royal bancshares consolidated financial statements
