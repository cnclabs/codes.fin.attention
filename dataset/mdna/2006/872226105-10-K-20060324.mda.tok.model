mechanical business sales increased by million in due to million of improved volume  million from price increases  and million of favorable currency fluctuation

gross profits of the mechanical business declined approximately million  from of sales in to of sales in  principally due to increases in raw material costs and the non recurring costs described above and the million effect of lower production levels  particularly in the second half of the year  as compared to the prior year 
the electronic business gross profit declined slightly from of sales in to of sales in  or million  as favorable currency fluctuations and nominal price increases were more than offset by reduced fixed cost absorption as a result of reduced sales and related production volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined million in compared to the previous fiscal year 
due to increased revenue levels  the above decline in these costs resulted in selling  general and administrative expenses being of sales in compared to of sales in reasons contributing to this decline include the recognition of approximately million of costs associated with the change in the company s chief executive and financial officers and recognition of million of credit losses related to business activities in latin america during the second half of fiscal the non recurrence of these costs in was offset in part by higher salary and benefit costs for the company s administrative force and increased freight costs related to higher mechanical products volume and fuel price increases

the proceeds were used to retire amounts outstanding under the company s outstanding revolving line of credit as well as to fund existing letters of credit that support million of industrial revenue bonds and certain obligations under various self insured workers compensation insurance policies 
the borrowings under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets and pledges of of the outstanding stock of the company s canadian  german and mexican subsidiaries 
the loan agreement was amended on july  to extend the term for an additional two years through april and permit the company to borrow up to million to fund the purchase of up to million shares of outstanding common stock and repay term loan b  the outstanding balance of which was approximately million 
all borrowings under the loan agreement bear variable interest of a margin plus libor or us prime rate  and the remaining term loan a is repayable in monthly principal installments totaling million

based on the operating results  the interest rates for both the revolving and term loans are expected to be reduced by basis points beginning in the second quarter of at december  the company had remaining borrowing capacity of million 
had the loan agreement been in place at december   the unused borrowing capacity available to the company would have been approximately million

on october  the company entered into a securities purchase agreement in exchange for the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes valued at million and detachable warrants  valued at million  to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the senior subordinated notes have a stated rate of effective rate of  are due on october   and contain customary financial covenants similar to  but less restrictive than the company s senior secured bank indebtedness described above 
the proceeds from the sale of the notes and detachable warrants were used to acquire million shares of the company s common stock at a purchase price of million  repay approximately million of term debt under the company s senior secured borrowing agreement  pay million of transaction costs related to the stock purchase and related financing transaction  with the balance providing additional working capital 
the company has generated positive cash flows from operations in each of the last five years 
during  the company generated million cash from operating activities  which compares to million for the same period in the prior year 
the primary reason for this fluctuation was of increased cash flow from operating results  together with of increased cash flow from reduced investment in net operating assets in compared to the major reason for the improvement in cash generated from operating results was the company generating million of positive cash flow from continued focus on inventory reduction  compared to million in management currently expects that inventory will grow moderately in in line with demand  while at the same time the company works to further improve inventory turns through better processes and lean manufacturing initiatives 
in addition  cash generated from operating activities relative to reported earnings  increased in as net income in included a million non cash after tax gain related to the termination of the company s post retirement health care benefits plan 
the company s total working capital was million at december   compared to million on december  the company used million and million for investing activities during the years ended december  and  respectively 
this spending was primarily for capital expenditures of million in and million in the company s capital investments have been at maintenance levels to support new product introductions  improve product quality  and reduce operating costs 
following a period of limited capital investment  in the company plans to spend million on capital improvements for expanded machine tool capacity  improved operating efficiencies and normal capital maintenance projects 
while this is currently in excess of the million permitted under its borrowing agreements  management believes its lenders to be supportive of this capital plan 
the amount of commitments for capital expenditures at december  was not significant 
cash used in financing activities increased to million in compared to million in as the company expended million in purchase and transaction costs to acquire million shares of its common stock in a self tender auction and repay approximately million of amounts previously borrowed under its secured revolving credit term loans  all funded through a new unsecured borrowing with detachable warrants that totaled million

during  million of such term debt was repaid as scheduled 
the company did not pay any dividends in compared to million of dividends paid in in the fourth quarter of  the company suspended its dividend pending the negotiation of its new credit facility  which restricted dividend payments throughout the company s future ability to declare and pay dividends is ultimately dependent upon its ability to operate at profitable levels and demonstrate compliance with its borrowing agreements 
the effect of changes in foreign currency rates reduced cash by million in compared to generating an increase in cash of million in as the dollar strengthened compared to the euro  offset by a continued weakening against the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent  the mexican peso 
as a result of all of the above items  the company generated a net increase in cash of million in compared to the net decrease in cash of million experienced in the company believes that the combination of cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the company s operations for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and as that term is described by the securities and exchange commission 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for the majority of inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 
the company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
revised share based payment  a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation which the company adopted in the third quarter of this statement did not have any significant effect on the company s financial statements as the company had previously adopted fasb statement no 
to account for stock based compensation cost using the fair value method in as the company has already adopted fasb statement no 
the only effects of the revised statement no 
upon the company are expanded disclosure related to its stock based compensation plan 
in november  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage which the company is required to adopt for the fiscal year ending december  the statement introduces the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
the company does not expect this statement to have any significant effect upon its consolidated financial statements based on current operating and product demand levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential change in an asset s or financial instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company s primary market risk exposures are unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and each of the euro  canadian dollar and mexican peso  and the interest rate 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
the company s financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
management does not currently hedge its interest or foreign currency exchange risks 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the company has operations in several foreign countries  and approximately million of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
no foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates were entered into during and the company used a foreign exchange forward contract with regard to the canadian dollar in the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between company subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net income by less than million 
interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate payable on the company s borrowings is influenced by the company s operating performance and degree of leverage  libor  as well as by actions of the federal reserve bank board in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate that underlies the cost of funds borrowed by the company 
in as in  in response to improved economic conditions and inflationary tendencies  the federal reserve took several actions to increase interest rates 
this  along with similar actions of other central banks  led to a rise in libor 
as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under its revolving and term secured credit facility increased in this  coupled with the company s separate borrowings under the terms of a higher rate subordinated debt in october  contributed to a corresponding increase in the company s interest expense 
to the extent that the federal funds interest rate and libor continue to rise in the future  the effective interest rate on company s revolving and term secured facility will increase  and the company s interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant 
based on the balance outstanding under the company s secured credit facility at december   a change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by million
