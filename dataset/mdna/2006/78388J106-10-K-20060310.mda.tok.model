the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in item b 
risk factors of this form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below

risk factors 
we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers 
we currently operate in the eastern third of the united states  where substantially all of our towers are located 
our principal business line is our site leasing business 
in our site leasing business  we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own  manage for or lease from others 
the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider  built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired 
as of december   we owned  towers  the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators  who like us  have built such towers taking into consideration co location opportunities 
in addition  through our site development business  we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 
revenues derived from the leasing of antenna space at  or on  communication towers continued to increase as a result of our emphasis on our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites 
during  we completed our previously announced plan of disposing of our services business in the western two thirds of the united states 
site leasing services our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long term lease contracts 
site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants  including alltel  cingular  sprint nextel  t mobile and verizon wireless 
revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different tenant leases 
each tenant lease relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years  and is renewable for five year periods at the option of the tenant 
almost all of our tenant leases contain specific rent escalators  which average per year  including the renewal option periods 
tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements 
rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 
cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of rental payments on ground and other underlying property leases  straight line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the minimum lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property lease  site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs  utilities  property insurance  and property taxes 
for any given tower  such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period 
as such  operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower 
the amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs 
the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems  painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 
lastly  ground leases are generally for an initial term of years or more with multiple renewal options of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average annually or provide for term escalations of approximately 

table of contents the table below details the percentage of total company revenues and operating profit contributed by the site leasing segment 
information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site leasing services business is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
percentage of revenues operating profit contribution for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  site development services our site development business is a corollary to our site leasing business  and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities  such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations 
our site development services business consists of two segments  site development consulting and site development construction  through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of end to end services 
we principally perform services for third parties in our core  historical areas of wireless expertise  specifically site acquisition  zoning  technical services and construction 
site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers 
our site development customers engage us on a project by project basis  and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty 
site development projects  both consulting and construction  include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis 
time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered 
our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete 
for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis  we bill the client  and recognize revenue  based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis 
upon the completion of each phase  we recognize the revenue related to that phase 
our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total cost for each contract 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 
revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities  which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients capital expenditures  the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period  weather and other factors 
cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials  salaries and labor costs  including payroll taxes  subcontract labor  vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects 
all costs related to site development consulting projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 
since our site development services profit levels have decreased significantly as a result of a substantial decline in capital expenditures by wireless service providers particularly during as well as competitive pricing pressures that have driven margins below our desired levels 
the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues and total segment operating profit contributed by site development services over the last three years 
information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site development services businesses is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents for the year ended december  percentage of revenues operating profit contribution site development consulting site development we have mitigated the decline in site development services revenues and operating profit levels by focusing on site leasing as our primary business as well as focusing on our core  historical areas of wireless expertise  specifically site acquisition  zoning  technical services and construction for our site development services business 
during  we completed our previously announced plan to exit the services business in the western portion of the united states based on our determination that the business was no longer beneficial to our site leasing business 
gross proceeds realized from sales during the fiscal year ended december  were million  and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million was recorded  which is included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included herein 
our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 
construction revenue revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total cost for each contract 
this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 
asset impairment we evaluate the potential impairment of individual long lived assets  principally the tower sites 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site 
we consider 
table of contents many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to general market and economic conditions  historical operating results  geographic location  lease up potential  and expected timing of lease up 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in determining an asset s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 
changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management s estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect  a future impairment charge may be required

in december  we issued million of our senior notes and used the proceeds to redeem and or repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes  of which we repurchased million in december and redeemed the remaining million on february  on may   we issued million shares of our class a common stock 
the shares were issued off of the universal shelf registration statement we have on file with the securities and exchange commission sec which registers the issuance of any combination of the following securities class a common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares or warrants 
the net proceeds from the issuance were million after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses  and were used to redeem an accreted balance of million of the senior discount notes and to pay the applicable premium for the redemption

the cmbs certificates are rated investment grade and have an expected life of five years with a final repayment date in we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds from this issuance to refinance the prior senior credit facility and fund reserves and expenses associated with the cmbs transaction 
the remainder of the net proceeds will be used by us at our discretion 
we also have on file with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s registering shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the united states 
as of december   we have approximately million shares of class a common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement 
on december   we closed on a new senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
the new facility consists of a million revolving loan which may be borrowed  repaid and redrawn  subject to compliance with certain covenants 
the new facility will mature on december  amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points or at a base rate plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points 
amounts borrowed under this facility will be secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba senior finance ii s assets and are guaranteed by certain of our other subsidiaries 
no amounts were outstanding under this facility at december  as of december   we were in full compliance with the terms of the new credit facility and had the ability to draw an additional million giving effect to leverage limitations contained in the indenture governing the senior discount notes 
a main priority for us continues to be reductions in our weighted average cost of debt 
as part of this initiative we have  and may continue to  repurchase for cash and or equity our higher cost outstanding indebtedness 
as a result of our refinancing  debt repurchase and redemption activities  we have reduced our weighted average cost of debt from at december  to at december  
table of contents cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  this amount was primarily the result of operating income from the site leasing segment exclusive of depreciation  accretion  and amortization 
in addition to our capital restructuring activities completed in  and  in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants  we may explore a number of alternatives  including selling certain assets or lines of business  issuing equity  repurchasing  restructuring  or refinancing or exchanging for equity some or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives  including securitization transactions  and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives 
upon closing the cmbs transaction in november  we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds to refinance the entire million senior credit facility  which had a balance outstanding of million  and we intend to explore the possibilities and alternatives for refinancing our remaining high yield debt securities in the future 
one or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of entering into a new credit facility  issuing high yield notes  entering into a securitization transaction  issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or converting our existing indebtedness into shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock  any of which would dilute our existing shareholders 
we cannot assure you that any of these strategies can be consummated  or if consummated  would effectively address the risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness

as of february   we plan to make total cash capital expenditures during of million to million primarily in connection with our plans to build between and towers  and to make cash expenditures of approximately million relating to the acquisition of towers already acquired or under signed purchase agreements as of february  all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand  cash flow from operations  availability under our new senior credit facility  and or through the issuances of our class a common stock in connection with tower acquisitions 
we estimate we will incur approximately  per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers 
all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio and our new tower build program

the purpose of the cmbs transaction was to refinance our prior senior credit facility and therefore continue to improve our balance sheet 
in connection with the cmbs transaction  the prior senior credit facility was amended and restated to replace sba properties as the new borrower  to completely release sba finance and the other guarantors of any obligations under the senior credit facility  to increase the principal amount of the loan to million and to amend various other terms as amended and restated  the mortgage loan 
furthermore  the mortgage loan was purchased by the depositor with proceeds from the cmbs transaction 
the depositor then assigned the mortgage loan to the trust  who has all rights as lender under the mortgage loan 
interest on the mortgage loan will be paid from the operating cash flows from sba properties  tower sites 
sba properties is required to make monthly payments of interest on the mortgage loan 
subject to certain limited exceptions described below  no payments of principal will be required to be made prior to the monthly payment date in november  which is the anticipated repayment date 
however  if the debt service coverage ratio  defined as the net cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan agreement divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan  servicing fees and trustee fees that sba properties will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months  as of the end of any calendar quarter  falls to times or lower  then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments  to fund required reserves  to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents  referred to as excess cash flow  will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to sba properties 
the funds in the reserve account will not be released to sba properties unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds times for two consecutive calendar quarters 
if the debt service coverage ratio falls below times as of the end of any calendar quarter  then an amortization period will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan 
otherwise  on a monthly basis  the excess cash flow of sba properties held by the trustee after payment of principal  interest  reserves and expenses is distributed to sba properties 
sba properties may not prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part at any time prior to november  except in limited circumstances such as the occurrence of certain casualty and condemnation events relating to sba properties tower sites 
thereafter  prepayment is permitted provided it is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration 
if the prepayment occurs within nine months of the final maturity date  no prepayment consideration is due 
the entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan will be due in november the mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time 
the mortgage loan is secured by mortgages  deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the  tower sites and their operating cash flows  a security interest in substantially all of sba properties personal property and fixtures and sba properties rights under the management agreement it entered into with sba network management  inc relating to the management of sba properties tower sites by sba network pursuant to which sba network arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on sba properties behalf 
for each calendar month  sba network is entitled to receive a management fee equal to of sba properties operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month 
december senior credit facility on december   sba senior finance ii closed on a new senior credit facility in the amount of million 
this facility consists of a revolving line of credit that may be borrowed  repaid and redrawn 
amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points or at a base rate plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points 
all outstanding amounts under the term facility are due december  this facility replaces our prior senior credit facility which was assigned and became the mortgage loan in connection with the cmbs transaction  as discussed above 

table of contents amounts borrowed under this facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba senior finance ii s assets 
in addition  each of sba senior finance ii s subsidiaries has guaranteed the obligations of sba senior finance ii under the senior credit facility and has pledged substantially all of their respective assets to secure such guarantee 
the new senior credit facility requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specified financial ratios  including ratios regarding its debt to annualized operating cash flow  debt service  cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter 
this new senior credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  restrict its ability to incur debt and liens  sell assets  commit to capital expenditures  enter into affiliate transactions or sale leaseback transactions  and or build towers without anchor tenants 
additionally  this facility permits distributions by sba senior finance ii to telecommunications and sba communications to service their debt  pay consolidated taxes  pay holding company expenses and for the repurchase of senior notes or senior discount notes subject to compliance with the covenants discussed above 
sba senior finance ii s ability in the future to comply with the covenants and access the available funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on its future financial performance 
as of december   we were in full compliance with the financial covenants contained in this agreement 
registration statements we have on file with the commission a shelf registration statement on form s registering shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the united states 
during the year ended december   we issued approximately million shares of class a common stock under this registration statement as partial consideration in connection with the acquisition of towers and related assets 
as of december   we had approximately million shares of class a common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement 
we also have on file with the commission a universal shelf registration statement registering class a common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares or warrants

as of december   we can still issue up to million of securities under our universal shelf registration statement 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  we cannot assure you that a change in the rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
although early adoption is allowed  we will adopt sfas r as of the required effective date for calendar year companies  which is january  sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements 
table of contents are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we have determined that we will use the modified prospective method to recognize compensation expense 
we currently utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to our employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based upon our evaluation of the alternative models available to value option grants  we have determined that we will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation 
other pronouncements in may  fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires that the change in accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
such a change would require us to restate its previously issued financial statements to reflect the change in accounting principle to prior periods presented 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in march  fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin was issued 
fin provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future event 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  december  for calendar year enterprises 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 
sfas 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this standard was effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents non gaap financial measures this report contains certain non gaap measures  including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information 
we have provided below a description of such non gaap measures  a reconcilement of such non gaap measures to their most comparable gaap measures  an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures  their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as loss from continuing operations plus net interest expenses  provision for income taxes  depreciation  accretion and amortization  asset impairment charges  non cash compensation  restructuring and other charges  and other expenses and excluding non cash leasing revenue and non cash ground lease expense 
we have included this non gaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the profitability and performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with some of our debt instruments  particularly our senior credit facility 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income as determined in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap measurements of adjusted ebitda and the adjusted ebitda margin have certain material limitations  including they do not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits and cash flows 
therefore any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations  they do not include depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits 
therefore any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations  they do not include provision for income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our costs  particularly in the future  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations  and they do not include non cash expenses such as asset impairment charges  non cash compensation  restructuring and other charges  other expenses  non cash leasing revenue and non cash ground lease expense 
because these non cash items are a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate profits  any measure that excludes these non cash items has material limitations 
we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda and the adjusted ebitda margin as only two of several comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results 

table of contents for the year ended december  in thousands loss from continuing operations add back deduct interest income interest expense non cash interest expense amortization of deferred financing fees depreciation  accretion and amortization asset impairment charges provision for income taxes loss from write off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt non cash compensation included in selling  general  and administrative non cash leasing revenue non cash ground lease expense restructuring expense other adjusted ebitda segment operating profit each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation  accretion and amortization 
total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the two segments 
segment operating profit is  in our opinion  an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment  while excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization 
segment operating profit is not intended to be alternative measures of revenue or operating income as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents site leasing segment for the year ended december  in thousands segment revenue segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation  accretion and amortization segment operating profit site development consulting segment for the year ended december  in thousands segment revenue segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation  accretion and amortization segment operating profit site development construction segment for the year ended december  in thousands segment revenue segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation  accretion and amortization segment operating profit the non gaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations 
specifically this measurement does not include depreciation  accretion  and amortization expense 
because depreciation  accretion  and amortization expense is required by gaap as it is deemed to reflect additional operating expenses relating to our site leasing and site development segments  any measure that excludes these items has material limitations 
we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of the cash generation of our segment operations
