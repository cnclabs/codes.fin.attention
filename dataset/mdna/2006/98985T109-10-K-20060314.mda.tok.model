item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapeutic protein based products for the treatment of human diseases 
the process for taking one of our discoveries to the marketplace is long  complex and very costly 
it is difficult to predict the time it will take to commercialize any given product candidate  but it would not be unusual to span ten years or more and cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
it is also a business of attrition  it is expected that  for the industry as a whole  less than of the drug candidates entering human clinical trials will actually make it to the marketplace 
for the products that do make it  particularly for those that address previously unmet medical needs  the markets can be significant  with a number of successful products selling in excess of billion per year 
an important element of our strategy is that we intend to maintain all or a significant share of the commercial rights to a number of our product candidates in north american markets 
as a result  we will be required to pay a significant portion of the development costs for these product candidates 
a second important element of our strategy is that we are developing a broad portfolio of product candidates to give our company more opportunities to be successful 
we currently have three product candidates in clinical development and expect to add additional proteins to this portfolio in the future 
thus  we are paying a significant portion of development costs for several potential products 
assuming these product candidates progress through clinical development successfully  the costs of clinical trials are expected to increase significantly 
our most significant financial challenges are to obtain adequate funding to cover the cost of product development  and to control spending and direct it toward product candidates that will create the most value for the company s shareholders over the long term 
it can be a complex and highly subjective process to establish the appropriate balance between cash conservation and value generation 
there are a number of important factors that we consider in addressing these challenges  including the following the nature  timing and magnitude of financing transactions  which would typically involve issuance of equity or equity based securities  the nature and timing of product development collaborations  which would typically provide for funding of a portion of the respective product development costs  as well as bring in near term potential revenues in the form of upfront fees and milestone payments  the breadth of product development programs  ie the number of potential disease indications for which a product candidate is tested in clinical trials  the number of products in our development portfolio and the decision to move new product candidates into clinical development  and periodic assessments of the relative capital requirements  risk and value of each of our product candidates 
we expect that it will be several years or more before we can generate enough product related revenues to reach net income or cash flow breakeven 
for example  we have estimated that our net loss will be within the range of million in  and that we will use net cash of million 
revenues from existing relationships help to defray our expenses  but additional funding will be required  the amount of which could be significant 
we may decide to enter into additional product development collaborations  which would reduce our funding requirements 
we may also generate funding through licensing of patents that are not relevant to our product development programs 
it is likely that we will continue to look for opportunities to raise equity capital as a primary means of funding our company over the next several years 
the equity markets for biotechnology stocks have tended to experience long cycles during which the sale of equity securities has been extremely difficult 
it is not possible to predict the timing or length of these cycles 
as a result  many biotechnology companies  including ours  have 
table of contents adopted an opportunistic strategy of raising equity capital when it is available 
we believe this strategy is important to minimizing the financial risks to our company and our shareholders 
consistent with our strategy  in august  we issued million shares of common stock raising net proceeds of million 
results of operations revenues royalties 
we earn royalties on sales of certain products subject to license agreements with novo nordisk  our former parent and current owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock  and several other companies 
royalties decreased in versus primarily due to insulin and glucagon patent expiration in certain countries and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates 
insulin and glucagon royalties declined to of our total royalty revenues in  from in this downward trend is expected to continue and  in  royalties for both insulin and glucagon in the remaining major markets will end 
we have opportunities to earn royalties in the future under other existing license agreements  such as royalties on sales of gem s  a product of biomimetic therapeutics  inc approved by the fda and launched commercially in late option fees 
in all three years presented  we earned an annual option fee of million from novo nordisk under an option and license agreement  pursuant to which we have granted an option to license certain rights to proteins that we discover 
the initial term of this agreement expired in november  however  novo nordisk exercised its right to extend the agreement to november and has paid us million per year for those two additional years 
we received the final payment from novo nordisk in november  of which million was recorded as deferred revenue at december  and will be recognized as option fee revenue in in september  we signed a five year strategic alliance agreement with serono under which serono may acquire rights and licenses to certain leads and targets from our research and development pipeline 
we recorded million and  of revenue from this agreement in and  respectively  and million was recorded as deferred revenue at december   which will be recognized at a rate of million per year 
license fees and milestone payments 
revenues from license fees and other up front payments are recognized over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations 
for certain license agreements that require no continuing performance of us  we record license fees as revenue upon execution of the agreement 
revenue from license fees increased in to million  from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the full year recognition of license fees in related to the novo nordisk rfactor xiii license agreement and serono strategic alliance license agreements executed in late in addition  we received and earned a one time  lump sum fee from eli lilly and company in early for a license to certain protein c patents 
revenue from license fees increased in from million in this increase was primarily due to the license fees earned in from the novo nordisk rfactor xiii license agreement and other licenses granted to novo nordisk and amgen  inc at december   million related to license agreements was recorded as deferred revenue  which we currently expect to be recognized in future periods as follows in thousands thereafter total revenues from milestone payments that represent completion of separate and substantive earnings processes are recognized when the milestone is achieved and amounts are due and payable 
from year to year  this revenue 
table of contents item can fluctuate substantially based on the completion of development related milestones 
milestone payment revenue earned in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to the achievement of development related milestones in by novo nordisk related to clinical development of rfactor xiii and by biomimetic therapeutics related to fda approval of gem s 
although revenue for both license fees and milestone payments increased in and  we do not expect this trend to continue in unless additional agreements are completed in that provide current year revenue 
overall  we anticipate a decline in total revenues in operating expenses research and development expense 
research and development expense has been our most significant expense to date  consisting primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  costs of consumables and contracted services 
generally  over the past two years  our research and development activities have expanded  particularly related to our clinical stage product candidates  rhthrombin  taci ig and il in  however  decreases in contracted services and noncash stock based compensation offset most of the increased costs related to the expansion 
in each of the past three years  research and development expense was slightly offset by cost reimbursements from novo nordisk for work performed on rfactor xiii and il the il preclinical collaboration ended in early and work supporting the rfactor xiii clinical development program began in late and is expected to end in the trends within major categories of research and development expense are shown in the following table in thousands 
salaries and benefits consumables facility costs contracted services depreciation and amortization noncash stock based compensation subtotal cost reimbursement from novo nordisk net research and development expense our most significant internal research and development costs are salaries and benefits  consumables and facility costs  as shown in the table above 
from year to year these costs  overall  have tended to show a relatively constant level of growth  tracking fairly consistently with increases in our employee base 
over the past three years  we have added approximately full time equivalent employees who are involved in product development activities 
contracted services include the cost of items such as contract manufacturing  clinical trials  non clinical studies and payments to collaborators 
these costs primarily relate to clinical development programs and can fluctuate substantially from year to year depending on the stage of our various programs 
generally  these external costs increase as a program advances toward commercialization  but there can be periods between major clinical trials during which costs decline 
our clinical trial costs increased in  reflecting the costs of rhthrombin phase clinical trials 
we experienced further clinical trial cost increases in corresponding to the start of a rhthrombin phase clinical trial and an increase in il clinical trial activity 
also  contract manufacturing costs tend to be incurred irregularly over the course of a development program  with relatively short manufacturing campaigns that may provide enough product to supply multiple years of clinical trial activity 
our contract manufacturing costs increased substantially in  reflecting process development and 
table of contents manufacturing campaigns for both rfactor xiii and rhthrombin 
the completion of this manufacturing work in late led to a decrease in contract manufacturing costs in to date  our business needs have not required us to fully allocate all research and development costs among our various programs 
however  we track direct labor  contracted services and certain consumable costs by program  which we monitor to ensure appropriate utilization of company resources 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs 
these costs include indirect labor  certain consumable costs  facility costs  and depreciation and amortization  all of which benefit all of our research and development programs 
the following table presents our research and development costs allocated to clinical development  pre development and discovery research programs  together with the unallocated costs that benefit all programs 
the costs of clinical development programs are presented from the inception of clinical development activities for such programs to date 
due to the relatively short duration and lack of defined outcomes for pre development and discovery programs  costs from inception to date are not meaningful 
inception to date clinical development programs hemostasis autoimmunity and oncology antiviral pre development programs discovery research programs unallocated indirect costs total the following summarizes the reasons for fluctuations in research and development program costs for the three years presented in the table hemostasis clinical development program rhthrombin and rfactor xiii costs increased substantially from to  reflecting process development and manufacturing campaigns for rfactor xiii and rhthrombin carried out in the completion of this manufacturing work and the licensing of rfactor xiii to novo nordisk in late led to the decrease in costs in autoimmunity and oncology clinical development program taci ig and il costs increased from to primarily due to the effect of million of il cost reimbursements from novo nordisk in increases in our share of taci ig joint development costs paid to serono contributed to the increases in both and increases in direct labor and consumables  particularly with respect to il development  also contributed to the increases in costs from to antiviral clinical development program costs in reflect the initiation of activities associated with advancement of il into clinical testing 
pre development program costs have declined slightly over the three years  while discovery research program costs have increased slightly  reflecting a modest shift in our research effort toward exploratory projects oriented to identifying new potential product candidates 
the estimated times and costs to completion for the various stages of clinical development can vary significantly  depending on the nature of the product candidate  the disease indication in which it is being tested and many other factors 
general expectations for estimated times to completion of each stage of clinical testing are shown in the following table 
clinical phase estimated completion time phase years phase years phase years 
table of contents due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical testing and the clinical trials associated with biopharmaceutical research and development programs  the remaining time and cost to complete any such projects is difficult to estimate 
each succeeding phase is dependent on the outcome of the previous one  and the data obtained from these studies may be inadequate to support advancement to the next phase  requiring added time and effort 
many projects will not advance to the next phase  even though they appeared promising based on earlier data and test results 
we anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase  as we continue to advance and expand our internal product development programs 
we expect that a number of factors  including the following  will contribute to an increase of in  before considering the added effect of noncash stock based compensation expense related to stock options and by  considering the added effect of noncash stock based compensation expense related to stock options 
costs of the rhthrombin phase program  including clinical trials and manufacture of product needed to support a bla filing  manufacture of initial rhthrombin bulk drug inventory for eventual commercial sale  increased clinical trial costs for taci ig and il with the initiation of phase testing and expansion of il testing into combination therapy  and increased staffing to support the advancing programs  particularly in the clinical  medical  quality and regulatory areas 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  professional fees and other corporate costs 
in  general and administrative expense decreased by versus although we experienced substantial cost increases due to added headcount and activities related to preparation for commercialization of rhthrombin  the increases were nearly offset by decreases in state and local taxes of  and decreases in noncash stock based compensation expense of million 
in  general and administrative expense increased over primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs and growth in supporting areas such as strategic marketing  an increase in state and local taxes related to transaction fees received  legal costs related to business development activities  and an increase in noncash stock based compensation expense attributable to a one time compensation charge of million related to the repayment of loans by certain executives 
we anticipate that our general and administrative requirements will increase to support our development programs as they advance towards commercialization  particularly with respect to rhthrombin 
we estimate that general and administrative expense may increase by in  before consideration of the noncash stock based compensation expense related to stock options and by  considering the added effect of noncash stock based compensation expense related to stock options 
noncash stock based compensation expense 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires instead that such transactions be 
table of contents accounted for using a fair value based method 
disclosure of the effect of expensing the fair value of equity compensation is currently required under existing literature see note to the financial statements 
sfas r will become effective for fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we will be required to begin expensing amounts related to employee stock options effective january  we have elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method and will determine fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
accordingly  we have estimated that the financial impact in will be to increase our operating expenses by approximately million  of which approximately will be classified as research and development expense and the remainder as general and administrative expense 
other income expense investment income 
investment income is generated primarily from investment of our cash reserves in investment grade  fixed income securities 
there are three primary factors affecting the amount of investment income that we report amount of cash reserves invested  the effective interest rate and the amount of gains or losses recognized 
the following table shows how each of these factors affected investment income for the three years reported in thousands weighted average amount of cash reserves effective interest rate investment income before gains and losses net gains losses on sales of investments investment income  as reported interest expense 
we have accounted for a sale leaseback transaction completed in october as a financing transaction 
under this method of accounting  an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale is considered a long term interest bearing liability 
rent payments under the leases are considered to be payments toward the liability and are allocated to principal and interest 
we recorded interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in and resulted from an additional lease obligation of approximately million effective upon completion of our facility expansion project in mid liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which we intend to use to fund our operations and capital expenditures over the next several years 
these cash reserves are held in a variety of investment grade  fixed income securities  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
we believe that our existing cash resources should provide sufficient funding for the next several years 
if we complete additional collaborative development transactions  which would generate both revenues and cost reductions  these cash resources would fund our company over a longer period of time 
cash flows from operating activities 
the amount of cash used to fund our operating activities generally tracks our net losses  with the following exceptions noncash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on sale or disposal of assets  and noncash stock based compensation  which do not result in uses of cash  noncash milestone revenues  which were paid to the company in the form of equity securities  net realized gains and losses and amortization of premium on short term investments  which are reflected as sources of cash from investing activities upon maturity or sale of the respective investments  changes in receivables  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain revenues and the subsequent receipt of cash payments  
table of contents changes in deferred revenue  which reflect the difference in timing between the receipt of cash from option fees  license fees and other upfront payments and the subsequent recognition of these amounts as revenue over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations  and changes in other assets and liabilities  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses and their payment 
generally  with the exception of changes in deferred revenue  we do not expect these items to generate material year to year fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of net cash used in operating activities 
substantial license or upfront fees may be received upon the date we enter into new licensing or collaborative agreements and be recorded as deferred revenue 
for example  in upon the execution of a strategic alliance agreement with serono and a license agreement with novo nordisk  we recorded million of deferred revenue  which is being recognized as revenue over approximately five years 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of deferred revenue from these and other transactions  causing our cash used in operating activities to be higher than our corresponding net loss 
the timing of additional deferred revenue transactions is expected to be irregular and  thus  has the potential to create fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of cash used in operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
our most significant use of cash in investing activities is for capital expenditures 
we expend a certain amount each year to maintain the effectiveness of our business  for example  to adopt newly developed technologies  expand into new functional areas  adapt our facilities to changing needs  or replace obsolete assets 
in addition  we have used cash to purchase land and expand our facilities 
the following table shows the amount of cash going toward each of these types of capital expenditures in thousands ongoing equipment facility expenditures expansion of r d facility  including pilot scale manufacturing plant total the research and development facility expansion project was partially funded by an allowance from our landlord  which is reflected as cash flow from financing activities 
the project began in april and construction was completed in mid we expect to spend approximately million in on routine capital equipment and facility projects 
cash flows from investing activities also reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and received from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows from financing activities 
net proceeds from common stock offerings constitute by far the largest element of financing cash flows 
we received million in net proceeds from an underwritten follow on offering completed in august  million from the sale of common stock to both amgen and serono in and million from the sale of common stock in another follow on offering in in  we completed a sale and leaseback of our headquarter buildings  which has been accounted for as a financing transaction 
our landlord provided an allowance of million to be applied toward the cost of our research and development facility expansion project 
we received million of this amount in and the remainder in we expect to incur substantial additional costs as we continue to advance and expand our product development programs 
we expect these expenditures to increase over the next several years  particularly if the 
table of contents outcomes of clinical trials are successful and our product candidates continue to advance 
our plans include the internal development of selected product candidates and the co development of product candidates with collaborators where we would assume a percentage of the overall product development costs 
if  at any time  our prospects for financing these programs decline  we may decide to reduce our ongoing investment in our development programs 
we could reduce our investment by discontinuing our funding under existing co development arrangements  establishing new co development arrangements for other product candidates to provide additional funding sources or out licensing product candidates that we might otherwise develop internally 
additionally  we could consider delaying or discontinuing development of product candidates to reduce the level of our related expenditures 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on several factors  many of which may not be in our control  including results of research and development programs  cash flows under existing and potential future arrangements with licensees  collaborators and other parties  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  and costs associated with the expansion of our facilities 
over the next several years we expect to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity based securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced  and these securities could have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or expansion plans  or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market internally  with license terms that are not favorable to us 
contractual obligations at december  we are contractually obligated to make payments as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years building lease obligations operating leases development contracts total the building lease obligations  which resulted from our sale leaseback financing transaction  reflect the reset of the lease terms to years beginning may operating lease remaining terms range from one to seven years 
operating leases generally relate to leased office space nearby our corporate headquarter buildings 
we have certain renewal provisions at our option  which are not reflected in the above table  for the building leases and the operating leases 
the development contracts include the production of process validation lots of rhthrombin  which may also be used partly for commercial purposes 
critical accounting estimates royalty revenue 
we earn royalties on two proteins marketed and sold by novo nordisk  insulin and glucagon 
royalties are received from novo nordisk quarterly within days after the end of the calendar 
table of contents quarter 
for insulin  the royalties are based on manufacturing costs for the quantity of insulin sold during the quarter 
these costs are calculated in danish kroner  and then converted to us dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the quarter 
royalties earned on sales of glucagon are calculated as a percentage of net sales 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data  estimates provided to us by novo nordisk and changes in the danish kroner to us dollar exchange rate 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties and  to date  have not been significant 
we also earn royalties on several products marketed by other companies 
royalties on these products are received within to days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties 
to date  these adjustments have not been significant 
license and upfront fees 
we enter into various licensing and collaborative agreements that generate significant license or other upfront fees with subsequent milestone payments earned upon completion of development milestones 
we estimate the period over which we have continuing commitments to perform under these agreements 
revenue from upfront fees is recognized on a straight line basis over this period  which has ranged in duration from six months to ten years 
for certain license agreements that require no continuing performance on our part  license fee revenue is recognized immediately upon execution of the agreement 
stock based compensation 
as permitted by the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we elected to follow accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for employee stock option grants and apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas to account for our stock option plans 
under apb  compensation expense is based on the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we granted options with exercise prices that were lower than the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
we used our best judgment to estimate the fair value of our stock as of the various grant dates  which resulted in share prices ranging from to 
based on these estimated values  we recorded million of deferred compensation  which has been fully amortized at december  effective january  we will record stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this new standard applies to all unvested awards and all future awards at the adoption date 
the stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested awards as of the adoption date will be recorded according to sfas  as is shown in our pro forma disclosure in note awards granted after the adoption date will be recorded as expense according to sfas r 
the company has elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method and will determine fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
accordingly  the company has estimated that the financial impact in will be to increase net loss by approximately million to million 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including united states government and agency securities  high grade united states corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we have no other material foreign currency exposure  nor do we hold derivative financial instruments
