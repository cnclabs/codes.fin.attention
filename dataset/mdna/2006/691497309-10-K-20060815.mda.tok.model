sales and marketing in continuing operations  we sold our products to more than  active customers in fiscal our largest customers accounted for  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
no individual customer accounted for greater than of our consolidated net sales during fiscal we believe that our long standing relationships with all of our major customers are good 
we maintain apparel sales offices and showrooms in several locations  including atlanta  new york  seattle  london  hong kong and dusseldorf 
our wholesale operations employ a sales force consisting of salaried and commissioned sales employees and independent commissioned sales representatives 
approximately of our net sales in fiscal were generated by our salaried employees 
the remaining portion of our net sales were generated by independent commissioned sales representatives 
more than of our net sales in fiscal were to customers located within the united states 
several of our product lines are designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale to department and specialty stores and certain specialty chain and catalog customers 
we make commitments for fabric and production in connection with these lines 
these commitments can be up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers 
these lines include both popular and better price merchandise sold under brand and designer names or customers private labels 
if orders do not materialize  we may incur expenses to terminate our fabric and production commitments and dispose of excess inventories 
we work closely with many customers in the national chain and mass merchant tiers of distribution to develop product programs and secure orders prior to the commencement of production 
the large volume orders typical in these tiers of distribution enable us to take advantage of relative efficiencies in planning raw materials purchasing and utilization of production facilities 
these programs generally relate to private label merchandise 

table of contents as is customary in our industry  we carry levels of inventory necessary to meet anticipated delivery requirements of our customers 
also  as is customary in our industry  we extend credit terms to our customers  the majority of which range from to days 
in addition to our wholesale operations  our tommy bahama group operates retail stores and restaurants in the united states  and our menswear group also operates ben sherman retail stores in the united kingdom and the united states 
manufacturing  raw materials  sources of supply and logistics manufacturing and raw materials we acquire our products by sourcing from third party producers  and to some degree we manufacture a portion of our products in our owned manufacturing facilities and through our joint venture partners 
in fiscal  we sourced approximately of our products from third party producers 
for fiscal  package purchases represented approximately and cut make trim cmt purchases represented approximately of our third party sourced units 
less than of our products were sourced from contractors in the united states 
package purchases are purchases which include both raw materials and cut  sew and finish labor 
we do not take ownership of package purchases until the goods are shipped 
cmt contract purchases are purchases in which we supply the raw materials and purchase cut  sew and finish labor from third party producers 
in cmt purchases  we retain ownership of the raw materials throughout the manufacturing and finishing process 
we typically conduct business with our producers on an order by order basis 
our third party producers perform cutting  sewing and or related operations to produce finished apparel products to the specifications and quality standards approved by us in advance 
we inspect fabric and finished goods throughout the manufacturing process as part of our quality control program to ensure that consumers receive products that meet our high standards 
the use of third party producers enables us to reduce working capital relating to work in process inventories 
to place orders and monitor production  we maintain buying offices in hong kong  singapore and india 
we monitor production in our offshore manufacturing locations by sending employees from our buying offices  employing local nationals and using unaffiliated buying agents 
in any given offshore location  we may use one or more of these methods of monitoring production 
the use of a large number of manufacturers enables us to maintain a stable  efficient and flexible manufacturing network 
for some manufacturers  we are the primary or only customer and have significant influence of the facility s capacity to cover our core  ongoing production needs 
this core manufacturing capacity is supplemented by an extensive network of contract manufacturers for which we are not the primary customer 
this second tier of manufacturing capacity enables us to handle short term increases in demand for production created by the seasonality of our business in certain products and other manufacturing demand that cannot be met by our core capacity 
we require all third party producers who manufacture or finish products for us to abide by a stringent code of conduct that sets guidelines for employment practices such as wages and benefits  working hours  health and safety  working age and disciplinary practices  and for environmental  ethical and legal matters 
in addition  many of our customers and licensors require compliance with their codes of conduct which may be more stringent than our code of conduct 
we regularly assess manufacturing and finishing facilities to ensure that they are complying with our code of conduct as well as the code of conduct of any customer or licensor 
our monitoring program includes periodic on site facility inspections and continuous improvement activities 
we also hire independent monitors to supplement our efforts 

table of contents sources of supply our products are manufactured from cotton  linen  wool  silk  other natural fibers  synthetics and blends of these materials 
the majority of the materials used in our manufacturing operations are purchased in the form of woven or knitted finished fabrics directly from numerous offshore fabric mills or from intermediary firms that purchase unfinished or greige fabric from mills and then re sell such fabric after dyeing and finishing it 
in addition  many of our buttons  zippers  thread and other trim items are also purchased from offshore suppliers 
we do not have long term raw materials contracts with any of our principal suppliers 
we regard our access to offshore sources of raw materials  finished goods and outside production as adequate for our needs 
we are not dependent on any single source or third party contract manufacturer as no single manufacturer accounts for a material portion of our purchases 
there are occasions when we are unable to take customer orders on short notice because of the minimum lead time required to produce a garment that is acceptable to the customer with respect to cost  quantity  quality and service 
we are unable to quantify the value of potential orders declined due to the inability to meet the required lead time 
we believe that our required lead times are competitive by industry standards 
logistics we operate a number of dedicated distribution centers in the united states and we also outsource distribution activities to third party logistics providers 
distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our plants and contractors  inspecting those products and shipping them to our customers 
we continually explore opportunities to improve efficiencies in our logistics activities

in addition to the above licenses  we have an exclusive distribution agreement in the united states and canada for evisu apparel and accessories 
although we are not dependent on any single license or design agreement  we believe our license and design agreements in the aggregate are of significant value to our business 
the license and design agreements mentioned above will expire at various dates through our fiscal year many of our licensing agreements are eligible for renewal or extension 
as shown in the table below  we offer numerous products through license arrangements with companies to use our tommy bahama and ben sherman trademarks 
certain of these licensed products are sold in our retail stores

our trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel  apparel related products  accessories  home furnishings and beauty products  as well as in connection with retail services 
we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks 
in general  trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with the products and services and the required registration renewals are filed 
we regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and  on a worldwide basis  continuously seek to protect them against infringement 
as a result of the appeal of our trademarks  our products have been the subject of counterfeiting 
we have an enforcement program to control the sale of counterfeit products in the united states and in major markets abroad 
in markets outside of the united states  our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established 
we may experience conflicts with various third parties which have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks  which may impede our use and registration of our trademarks in international markets 
while such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion  we generally intend to resolve such conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third party owners of the conflicting trademarks 
seasonal aspects of business and order backlog seasonal aspects of business although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be highly seasonal 
for example  the demand for golf and tommy bahama products is higher in the spring and summer seasons 
products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
the percentage of net sales from continuing operations by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  and the percentage of operating income from continuing operations by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  which may not be indicative of the distribution in future years 

table of contents order backlog as of june  and june   we had booked orders relating to our continuing operations amounting to million and million  respectively  substantially all of which we expect will be or were shipped within six months after each such date 
once we receive a specific purchase order  the dollar value of such order is included in our booked orders 
a portion of our business consists of at once edi quick response programs with large retailers 
replenishment shipments under these programs generally have such an abbreviated order life as to exclude them from the order backlog completely 
we do not believe that this backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods 
competition we sell our products in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous united states based and foreign apparel firms compete 
no single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry 
we believe we are one of the largest designers  manufacturers  marketers and wholesalers of consumer apparel products in the united states  but there are other apparel firms with greater sales and financial resources 
competition within the apparel industry is based upon styling  marketing  price  quality  customer service and  with respect to branded and designer product lines  consumer recognition and preference 
we believe we compete effectively with other members of the industry with regard to all of these factors 
successful competition in styling and marketing is related to our ability to foresee changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and to present appealing products to our customers 
successful competition in price  quality and customer service is related to our ability to maintain efficiency in sourcing and distribution 
successful competition with respect to branded and designer product lines is related to the high consumer recognition and loyalty that our owned and licensed brands enjoy 
substantially all of the apparel sold by us and our principal competitors is produced outside the united states 
most of the apparel sold by us and some of our competitors is sold to customers on a landed  duty paid basis after it is imported into the united states  while other apparel is sold on a direct basis in which the customer takes ownership in the country of production 
in this direct selling scenario  the customer handles the in bound logistics and customs clearance 
direct selling represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal direct sourcing by our customers presents a competitive challenge to us in our private label business as our customers purchase apparel directly from the third party producers instead of from us 
we are not able to quantify the impact that direct sourcing has had on our net sales or margins  but as many of our major customers purchase an increasing percentage of their apparel on a direct sourcing basis the opportunities to sell on a delivered  duty paid basis are reduced 
we believe that the relative price advantage to retailers of direct sourcing is offset  to some extent  by several factors 
first  our long term relationships with foreign facilities enables us to offer the retailers better and more consistent quality  better adherence to delivery schedules and a more reliable flow of more accurate information than that which is available to them from many of the facilities that offer them direct sourcing 
in addition  we believe the services we provide in the areas of product development  design and supply chain management offset  to some extent  the relative price advantage of direct sourcing 
we believe that choosing the most competitive countries for the production of our products is critical to our competitiveness 
the most competitive location to produce or source a particular product depends on a variety of factors 
these factors include availability of globally competitive fabric and other raw materials  labor and manufacturing costs  ability to meet quality standards  required lead times  logistics and the impact of international trade rules and trade preference agreements and legislation on apparel exports from that country to the united states 

table of contents trade regulation international trade agreements  trade preference arrangements and trade legislation are important because most apparel imports into the united states are highly restricted 
there are two key types of restrictions 
first  there are duties levied on the value of imported apparel 
the duty rates on the cotton and wool product categories that cover the majority of our products range from to 
silk products represent a major portion of our tommy bahama line and are generally subject to duty rates less than 
second  until january   the united states had implemented restrictive quotas on the importation of many classifications of textiles and apparel products from most of the major apparel producing countries  including most of the countries where we produce apparel and including the cotton and wool product categories that cover the majority of our products 
these quota restraints placed numerical limits on the quantity of garments permitted to be imported into the united states in a given year on a by country and by product category basis 
the effect of these quotas was to limit the amount of apparel that could be sourced in the countries that offered the most competitive fabrics and most competitive apparel manufacturing 
as a result  a substantial portion of cotton and wool apparel imported into the united states was sourced  prior to january   from countries that would not be the most competitive producers in the absence of quotas 
silk products were not subject to quota restraints 
pursuant to authority granted by china s world trade organization wto accession agreement  both the united states and the european union have re imposed quotas on a number of key product categories from china 
absent the non market restrictions created by quotas and absent duty saving advantages available with respect to the products of certain countries under the terms of various free trade agreements and trade preference arrangements  we believe that generally the most competitive fabrics and apparel manufacturing  are in asia and the indian sub continent 
consequently  the elimination of quotas has resulted in a reduction in our western hemisphere sourcing and manufacturing activities and an increase in our sourcing and manufacturing activities in asia and the indian sub continent 
the trend away from western hemisphere sourcing and manufacturing may be slowed to some extent by various current and proposed free trade agreements and trade preference programs 
we believe that by selecting the locations where we produce or source our products based in part on trade regulations  we are effective and will continue to be effective in using various trade preference agreements and legislation to our competitive advantage 
we believe that with respect to most of our production  we will continue to be able to source from the most competitive countries because of the flexibility of our manufacturing and sourcing base 
this flexibility is provided by the fact that while we have long term relationships with many of our contract manufacturers  we do not have long term contractual commitments to them and are able to move our production to alternative locations if competitive market forces so dictate 
in addition  it would be relatively inexpensive for us to shut down one or more of our owned factories if such action is required to meet the competitive demands of the marketplace 
the relative ease with which we can exit our currently owned and contract manufacturing facilities  if necessary  provides us with the ability to shift our production relatively quickly as different countries become more productive 
employees as of june   we employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately were employed in the united states 
approximately of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees 
we believe our employee relations are excellent 
code of ethical conduct our board of directors has adopted a code of ethical conduct for our principal executive officer  our principal financial officer  and other designated key financial associates 
additionally  our board of directors has adopted a conflict of interest and business ethics policy for all of our employees 
our employees are expected to adhere at all times to these policies  as applicable 
we have posted both of these codes on our website 
we will also disclose any amendments or waivers to our code of ethical conduct on our website

item a 
risk factors our business faces certain risks  of which many are outside of our control 
the following factors  as well as factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the sec  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company 
if any of the following risks  or other risks or uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial  actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could suffer 
the apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as domestic and international economic conditions change 
overall economic conditions that affect discretionary consumer spending include  but are not limited to  employment levels  energy costs  interest rates  tax rates  personal debt levels and stock market volatility 
uncertainty about the future may also impact the level of discretionary spending or result in shifts in consumer spending to products other than apparel 
any deterioration in general economic or political conditions  acts of war or terrorism or other factors that create uncertainty or alter the discretionary consumer habits in our key markets  particularly the united states and the united kingdom  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition or operating results 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and we face significant competitive threats to our business from various third parties 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
our competitors include numerous apparel designers  manufacturers  distributors  importers  licensors and retailers  some of which may also be our customers 
the level and nature of our competition varies and the number of our direct competitors and the intensity of competition may increase as we expand into other markets or as other companies expand into our markets 
retailers that are our customers may pose our most significant competitive threat by sourcing their products directly or marketing their own private label brands 
some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we have  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

table of contents the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends  and we must continuously offer innovative and upgraded products 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
although certain of our products carry over from season to season  the apparel industry in general is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  we must anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging as well as proven fashion trends 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to continuously develop  source  market and deliver a wide variety of innovative  fashionable  saleable brands and products 
these products must be offered at competitive prices in the respective distribution channels 
revenue growth from our brands will depend largely upon our ability to continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identities 
many other companies offer products that resemble and or compete with our branded products 
they may offer these products at significantly lower price points in order to directly compete with our branded merchandise sold at higher prices 
to the extent such competitors are successful  we may not be able to maintain the premium price points that our branded products have traditionally commanded 
although we try to manage our inventory risk through early order commitments by our wholesale customers  we may place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season s orders and orders may be cancelled by our wholesale customers before shipment 
to the extent actual demand exceeds forecasted demand  we may not have an adequate supply of products to meet consumer needs 
due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry  there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumers preferences and fashion trends 
any failure on our part to develop appealing products and update core products could limit our ability to differentiate our products 
additionally  such a failure could leave us with a substantial amount of unsold excess inventory  which we may be forced to sell at lower price points 
any of these risk factors or a shift in consumer demographics could result in the deterioration in the appeal of our brands and products  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and operating results 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to implement our business strategy 
our success depends on our ability to implement our business strategy 
we face many challenges in implementing our strategy of shifting from primarily a private label apparel company to a branded apparel company 
important aspects of this strategy include our ability to maintain and grow our existing lines of business  acquire additional businesses in the future and selectively dispose of or discontinue certain operations that are not in line with our strategy  each of which has certain inherent risks 
as changes occur in our industry  it may be necessary for us to alter our strategy 
there can be no guarantees that our strategy  at any given time  will be the optimal strategy for our company or that we will be able to implement the strategy effectively due to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
an inappropriate strategy or ineffective implementation of our strategy could result in a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in order to maintain our existing business and offer new product lines  we may incur substantial costs which may not be recoverable 
we intend to continue to maintain and grow our existing business through our current customer base as well as the growth of our retail business  which may require a substantial amount of fixed costs  long term leases  capital improvements and marketing and advertising costs 
additionally  we intend to offer new product lines in the future 
as is typical with new products  market acceptance of new designs and products we may introduce is subject to uncertainty 
in addition  the introduction of new lines and products often require substantial costs in design  marketing and advertising  which may not be recovered if the products are not successful 
in the event that the products or brands that we internally develop are not successful  our image and operating results may be negatively impacted 

table of contents the acquisition of new businesses has certain inherent risks  including  for example  strains on our management team  unexpected acquired costs  and  in some instances  earn out payments 
we intend to continue to acquire new business in the future if appropriate investment opportunities are available 
our sales growth may be limited if we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices in the future or if the acquisitions do not achieve the anticipated results 
these acquisitions may strain our administrative  operational and financial resources and distract our management from our other businesses 
the integration process could create a number of challenges and adverse consequences for us  including the unexpected loss of key employees  suppliers  customers  and sales or an increase in other operating costs 
further  we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
as a result of acquisitions that have occurred or may occur in the future  we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with the acquired businesses 
we cannot be assured that any indemnification to which we may be entitled from the sellers will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business acquired 
similar to the terms of the tommy bahama acquisition  the terms of any future acquisitions may require us to make substantial payments to the sellers in performance based contingent payments for a number of years after the acquisition 
the earnings upon which these payments are contingent may not be determined by actual cash flows and consequently may not reflect our ability to make such payments 
additionally  certain of the sellers may be key members of management 
it is possible that their interests with respect to the contingent payments will differ from the interests of our company as a whole 
such differences may occur if they have incentives to maximize the profitability of the acquired business during the contingent payment term  which may be to the detriment of the longer term prospects for the business 
when dispositions occur  we may be required to find alternative uses for our resources to reduce excess capacity and replace those operations 
as we did in fiscal with respect to our womenswear operations  we may determine that it is appropriate to dispose of certain operations 
dispositions of certain businesses that do not align with the strategy of our company as a whole or the discontinuation of certain product lines which may not provide the returns that we expect may result in excess capacity such as under utilized financial or production resources to some degree in the event that the operations are not replaced with new lines of business either internally or through acquisition 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to replace the sales and profits related to these businesses  which may result in a decline in our operating results 
the success of our operations depends on our ability to maintain an appropriate organization structure 
as we continue to expand into new product categories  markets and lines of business or discontinue certain operations  it is necessary for us to continue to assess the appropriate organizational structure within our company as a whole 
we must integrate complementary practices and processes in order to achieve synergies or other anticipated benefits 
in the past  we have consolidated various operational processes in order to reduce costs or achieve related synergies 
if we are unable to effectively organize our operations and manage our product lines in the future or  if we do not achieve expected cost reductions or synergies  our business  financial condition and operating results may be negatively impacted 
we rely on key management  the loss of whom may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our success depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization 
this execution requires experienced and talented management in our design  sourcing  distribution  merchandising  advertising  and support functions 
the loss of j 
hicks lanier  chairman and chief executive officer  michael j 
setola  president  s 
anthony margolis  group vice president  or any of our other executive officers or key 
table of contents employees  without an appropriate succession plan  or our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
the apparel industry has experienced price deflation in recent years  and price reductions in our products in the future could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the average net selling price of apparel continues to decrease in the apparel industry 
the decline is primarily attributable to increased competition  excess worldwide manufacturing capacity  increased product sourcing in lower cost countries  growth of the mass merchant and discount channels of distribution  consolidation in the retail industry  excess capacity of retail space  reduced relative spending on apparel and increased value consciousness on the part of consumers 
all of these impacts may continue in the future 
to remain competitive  we may need to reduce our prices from time to time in response to these deflationary pressures 
if one or more of our competitors is able to reduce their production or sourcing costs in any manner  we may experience additional pricing pressures and may be forced to reduce our prices or face a decline in sales 
our inability to lower costs in response to these pricing pressures could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  these deflationary pressures  even if met with reduced costs that do not adversely impact our sales volume  could reduce the revenues attributable to such sales and have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales 
we generate a significant percentage of our sales from a few major customers  to whom we extend credit without requiring collateral  resulting in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers 
for fiscal  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total net sales from continuing operations 
in addition  the net sales of our individual business segments may be concentrated among several large customers 
continued consolidation in the retail industry may increase the concentration of our customers  and therefore our risks in the united states and other markets 
this consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products  restructuring of our customers operations  more centralized purchasing decisions  direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers  potentially resulting in lower prices  realignment of customer affiliations or other factors which could negatively impact our business  financial condition or operating results 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers  instead relying on long standing relationships with these customers and our position within the marketplace 
as a result  purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time 
we face the risk that a decision by one or more major customers  whether motivated by competitive considerations  quality or style issues  financial difficulties  economic conditions or otherwise  could impact their desire or ability to purchase our products or change their manner of doing business with us 
an unanticipated decline in sales to one or more major customers could adversely affect our profitability as it would be difficult to immediately  if at all  replace this business with new customers or increase sales volumes with other existing customers 
we are subject to risks associated with changes in prices and availability of raw materials and other costs 
we and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices 
any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner 
the principal fabrics used in our business are cotton  linens  wools  silk  other natural fibers  synthetics and blends of these materials  some of which are heavily dependent on the cost of petroleum 
the prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them 
the price and availability of certain raw materials has in the past fluctuated  and may in the future fluctuate  significantly depending on a variety of factors  including crop yields  weather  supply conditions  government regulation  economic climate and other unpredictable factors 
additionally  costs of our third party providers or our 
table of contents transportation costs may increase due to a variety of factors including weather  supply conditions  government regulation  economic climate  energy costs and other unpredictable factors 
we have not historically entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices 
any significant raw material price or transportation cost increases could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are dependent upon our third party producers and sourcing agents ability to meet our requirements 
we source substantially all of our products from non exclusive third party producers and sourcing agents located in foreign countries 
we have not entered into long term contracts with any of these producers and sourcing agents 
therefore  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 
we regularly depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity 
we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers  such as the reduction of availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
such difficulties may negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
as more participants in the apparel industry continue to move towards sourcing from third parties  the competition for quality contractors has intensified 
some of these contractors have long standing relationships with our competitors 
to the extent we are not able to secure or maintain relationships with third party producers that are able to fulfill our requirements  our business  financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted 
we  and some of our customers  require third party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions  environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them 
as a result of higher costs relating to compliance with these standards  we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products 
in addition  the labor and business practices of independent apparel manufacturers have received increased attention from the media  non governmental organizations  consumers and governmental agencies in recent years 
any failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical in our key markets  and the potential litigation  negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events  could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation and impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
our dependence on foreign supply sources could result in disruptions to our operations in the event of disruptions in the global transportation network including strikes and work stoppages at port facilities  political instability or other international events  economic disruptions  foreign currency fluctuations  labor disputes at factories  the imposition of new or adversely adjusted tariffs  duties  quotas  import and export controls  taxes and other regulations  changes in us customs procedures concerning the importation of apparel products  changes in domestic or foreign governmental policies  actual or threatened acts of war or terrorism  or the occurrence of an epidemic 
these and other events beyond our control could interrupt our supply chain and delay receipt of our products in the united states or united kingdom  which could result in higher costs  including product and transportation costs  unanticipated inventory accumulation  or the loss of revenues  customer orders and customer goodwill  each of which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business is subject to regulatory risks associated with importing products 
as we source substantially all of our products from foreign countries  we are at risk to changes relating to the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate 
substantially all of our import operations are subject to tariffs and other charges imposed on imported products 
in addition  the countries in which our products are manufactured or countries into which our products are imported may impose additional or new quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes or other restrictions or adversely modify existing restrictions 
our operations are also subject to international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the wto 
trade agreements can impose requirements that adversely affect our 
table of contents business  such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase raw materials and setting quotas on products that may be imported into the united states from a particular country 
our or any of our supplier s failure to comply with customs or similar laws could restrict our ability to import product or lead to fines or other penalties 
we cannot guarantee that future trade agreements will not provide our competitors with a material advantage over us  which may negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property or may otherwise have our brand names harmed 
we believe that our registered and common law trademarks and other intellectual property  as well as other contractual arrangements  including licenses and other proprietary intellectual property rights  have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers 
therefore  our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property 
we rely on laws in the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization  particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
infringements upon our intellectual property may negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
from time to time  we discover products in the marketplace that are unauthorized reproductions of certain of our branded products or that otherwise infringe upon our trademarks and other intellectual property 
such counterfeiting typically increases as brand recognition increases 
despite any precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  expensive and time consuming and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use 
there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the creation of counterfeits  knock offs  imitations or infringement of our products or trademarks by third parties 
in the future  we may have to rely on litigation and other legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights or contractual rights 
if litigation that we initiate is unsuccessful  we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property and  in any case  any litigation or other legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights or contractual rights  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark disputes  as we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event a claim of infringement against us is successful  we may be required to pay damages  royalties or license fees to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time 
any litigation and other legal action of this type  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
we make use of debt to finance our operations  which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
our levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business  investments in acquisitions and working capital and divestitures 
as we continue to grow our business  and potentially make acquisitions in the future  our debt levels may increase under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities  which may increase our exposure to the items discussed below 
our indebtedness includes certain obligations and limitations  including the periodic payment of principal and interest  maintenance of certain financial covenants and certain other limitations related to additional debt  dividend payments  investments and dispositions of assets 
our ability to satisfy these obligations will be 
table of contents dependent upon our business  financial condition and operating results 
these obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industry in which we operate 
such limitations may negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
at the maturity of our indebtedness  we will be required to extend or refinance such indebtedness  sell assets to repay the indebtedness or raise equity to fund the repayment of the indebtedness 
additionally  a breach of any of the covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in an event of default under those instruments  allowing the holders of that indebtedness to declare all outstanding indebtedness immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to refinance our debt  we would most likely be unable to pay our outstanding indebtedness at maturity or if our debt was declared immediately due and payable 
we would  therefore  be required to seek alternative sources of funding  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or face bankruptcy 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or find alternative means of financing our operations  we may be required to curtail our operations or take other actions  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
also  borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk  and we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk 
these amounts are borrowed under such facilities in order to provide us with the necessary flexibility to adjust our debt levels as appropriate to provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate our business  including as a result of the impact of seasonality on our business 
in the event that interest rates increase  we may have to revise or delay our business plans  reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations 
an increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our cash flow towards interest even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
the apparel industry is heavily influenced by weather patterns and natural disasters  and our business may be adversely affected disproportionately by unseasonable weather conditions or natural disasters 
like others in our industry  our business  financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions or certain natural disasters which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations 
because of the seasonality of our business  the occurrence of such events at certain times could disproportionately impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
our foreign sourcing operations as well as the sale of products in foreign markets result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to increased inherent risks in conducting business outside of the united states 
substantially all of our contracts to have goods produced in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  such as the chinese yuan  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future  then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers  which would negatively impact our margins 
if the value of the us dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product  the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by any competitors that pay for goods in local currencies  and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices 
additionally  currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance 
we received us dollars for greater than of our product sales during fiscal the sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
table of contents and to a lesser extent sales of certain products in canada 
an increase in the value of the us dollar compared to these other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of earnings  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our exposure to foreign currency risk except that  on occasion  we do purchase foreign currency forward exchange contracts for our goods purchased on us dollar terms that are expected to be sold in the united kingdom and europe 
any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets that we operate could negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are dependent on a limited number of distribution centers  and if one becomes inoperable  our business  financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 
our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our primary distribution facilities  some of which are owned and others of which are operated by third parties 
finished garments from our contractors are inspected and stored at these distribution facilities 
if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  we could have a substantial loss of inventory and incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility 
this could negatively affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we license the right to use certain of our brand names under various agreements 
certain of our brands  such as tommy bahama and ben sherman  have a reputation of outstanding quality and name recognition  which makes the brands valuable as a royalty source 
we are able to license complementary products and obtain royalty income from the use of our brands names 
while we take significant steps to ensure the reputation of our brands is maintained through our license agreements  there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products 
the actions of a licensee may not only result in a decrease in the sales of our licensee s products but also could significantly impact the perception of our brands 
additionally  while we believe that our relationship with our principal licensees are favorable and the termination of any single licensing agreement would not have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole  our long term prospects will depend in part on the continuation of a significant percentage of existing licensing arrangements and the addition of other license agreements in the future  as well as ongoing consumer acceptance of the products sold under those license agreements 
if the licensees products are not acceptable to consumers  if licensee s actions are detrimental to our brands or if we do not add new license agreements  our business  financial condition and operating results may be negatively impacted 
we hold licenses for the use of other parties brand names  and we may not be able to guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names 
we have entered into license and design agreements to use well known trademarks and trade names  such as nautica  tommy hilfiger and oscar de la renta to market our products 
these license and design agreements will expire at various dates in the future 
although we believe our relationships with our principal licensors are generally favorable  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks 
if any one or more of these licenses expires or is terminated  we will lose the sales and profits generated pursuant to such license 
the loss of such sales and profits could negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results if not replaced with new license agreements 
in addition to certain compliance obligations  all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products 
if these thresholds are not met due to a general economic downturn 
table of contents or otherwise  our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved 
in addition  our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties  and we are unable to control the quality of goods that others produce 
if licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates  our sales and profits generated by such brands may decline and our business  financial condition and operating results may be negatively impacted 
we operate retail stores and restaurants which are subject to certain inherent risks 
an integral part of our strategy is to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our brands  including tommy bahama and ben sherman 
in addition to the general risks associated with the apparel industry  risks associated with our retail operations include our ability to find and select appropriate retail locations 
other risks include our ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms  build out the stores  source sufficient levels of consumer desirable inventory  hire  train and retain competent store personnel  install and operate effective retail systems  and apply appropriate pricing strategies 
retail stores involve a significant capital investment and incur significant fixed operating expenditures  including obligations under long term leases 
we cannot be sure that current stores will be profitable or that we can successfully complete our planned expansion 
also  as we expand the number of our retail stores  we run the risk that our wholesale customers will perceive that we are increasingly competing directly with them  which may lead them to reduce or terminate purchases of our products 
the restaurant industry is highly competitive and requires compliance with a variety of federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  our restaurants typically serve alcohol and  therefore  maintain liquor licenses 
our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant 
additionally  as a participant in the restaurant industry  we face risks related to food quality  food borne illness  injury and health inspection scores 
the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants  as well as the image of the brand as a whole 
we operate in various countries with differing laws and regulations  which may impair our ability to maintain compliance with regulations and laws 
in the ordinary course of business  we are party to certain claims  litigation or other regulatory actions 
such matters are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict with assurances the outcomes and ultimate financial impacts 
there can be no guarantees that actions that have been or may be brought against us in the future will be resolved in our favor 
additionally  although we attempt to abide by the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate  the complexity of the laws and regulations to which we are subject  including customs regulations  domestic and international tax legislation and environmental legislation  makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently  or will be in the future  compliant with all laws and regulations 
in the event of an unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations  our business  financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 
our operations are reliant on information technology  and any interruption or other failure in our information technology systems may impair our ability to provide services to our customers 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology 
information systems are used in all stages of our operations from design to distribution and are used as a method of communication between our domestic and foreign employees  as well as our customers and suppliers 
we also rely on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information to management in order to allocate resources and forecast our operating results 
system failures or service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors  including computer viruses  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters or failures to properly install  upgrade  integrate  protect  repair or maintain systems 
any interruption  or other failure  of critical business information systems may impair our ability to provide services to our customers and have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our operations  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview we generate revenues and cash flow through the design  sale  production and distribution of branded and private label consumer apparel and footwear for men  women and children and the licensing of company owned trademarks 
our principal markets and customers are located primarily in the united states 
we source more than of our products through third party producers 
we primarily distribute our products through our wholesale customers which include chain stores  department stores  specialty stores  specialty catalog and mass merchants 
we also sell our products for some brands in our own retail stores 
we operate in an industry that is highly competitive 
our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes across multiple market segments  distribution channels and geographic regions is critical to our success 
although our approach is aimed at diversifying our risks  misjudging shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on future operating results 
other key aspects of competition include quality  brand image  distribution methods  price  customer service and intellectual property protection 
our size and global operating strategies help us to successfully compete by providing opportunities for operating synergies 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are acceptable to the markets we serve and to source our products on a competitive basis while still earning appropriate margins 
the most significant factors impacting our results and contributing to the change in diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share of in fiscal from in fiscal were the disposition of our womenswear group operations for approximately million on june   resulting in all womenswear operations being reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented and diluted earnings from discontinued operations per common share of and in fiscal and fiscal the ownership of ben sherman for the entire year in fiscal  compared to ten months in fiscal after the july  acquisition  partially offset by the lower ben sherman operating results in the last half of fiscal compared to the prior year 
a significant increase in the operating margins of the tommy bahama group as a result of certain operating efficiencies that were implemented in late fiscal and early fiscal the repatriation of foreign earnings during fiscal  which resulted in a positive impact on our effective tax rate and an increase in earnings from continuing operations of million  or per diluted common share  in fiscal a growth in consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the growth in our menswear group 
the one time costs of million associated with the closure of four manufacturing facilities  consolidation of certain support functions in our menswear group  which resulted in after tax costs of per diluted common share in fiscal

net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price per unit of and an increase in unit sales of 

table of contents the menswear group reported a increase in net sales in fiscal the increase was due to the unit sales increase of in the historical menswear business from new marketing initiatives in tailored clothing and dress  knit and woven shirts  as well as the inclusion of ben sherman for twelve months of fiscal versus ten months of fiscal ben sherman brand net sales were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the average selling price per unit for the historical menswear business increased primarily due to a change in product mix 
the tommy bahama group reported a increase in net sales in fiscal the increase was due to an average selling price per unit increase of  excluding the private label business  resulting from increased retail sales and higher average selling price per unit on branded wholesale business 
the increase in retail sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of retail stores from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the higher average selling price per unit on branded wholesale business was due to lower levels of off price merchandise during fiscal the net sales increase was partially offset by exiting the private label business  which accounted for million of sales in fiscal and virtually no sales in fiscal gross profit increased in fiscal the increase was due to higher sales and higher gross margins 
gross margins increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increased margins of the tommy bahama group discussed below partially offset by the sales increases in the lower margin businesses in the menswear group and the one time costs associated with the closure of four manufacturing facilities in our menswear group 
our gross profit may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors  as income statement classifications of certain expenses may vary by company 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased during fiscal sg a was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal the increase in sg a was primarily due to the ownership of ben sherman for twelve months in fiscal compared to ten months in fiscal  the higher sg a expense structure associated with our ben sherman branded business  additional tommy bahama and ben sherman retail stores  expenses associated with the start up of new marketing initiatives in the menswear group  and costs associated with the consolidation of certain support functions in the menswear group 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal the decrease was due to certain intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions of tommy bahama and ben sherman  which have a greater amount of amortization in the earlier periods following the acquisition than later periods 
this decline was partially offset by recognizing amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in the ben sherman transaction for the entire period during the twelve months of fiscal compared to only ten months in the prior year 
royalties and other operating income increased in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the benefit of licensing related to our ben sherman brand for the entire twelve months of fiscal  as well as higher royalty income from existing and additional licenses for the tommy bahama brand 
operating income increased in fiscal the menswear group reported a decrease in operating income in fiscal the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decline in operating income at ben sherman and in our historical menswear business 
the decline in operating income in our ben sherman business was primarily due to markdowns  allowances and returns resulting from poorly performing product lines and aggressive sales plans in the second half of fiscal the decline in operating income in our historical menswear business was 
table of contents primarily due to the closure of the manufacturing facilities  consolidation of support functions and streamlining of operations mentioned above 
the tommy bahama group reported an increase of in operating income in fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily due to improvements in gross margins due to higher retail sales  improvements in product sourcing and improved inventory management  which resulted in reduced mark downs  exiting the private label business  which provided lower margins  and reduced amortization expense related to intangible assets 
the corporate and other operating loss decreased million  or  in fiscal the decrease in the operating loss was primarily due to decreased parent company expenses  including a decrease in incentive compensation 
interest expense  net decreased in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the non recurring million charge recognized in the first quarter of fiscal related to the refinancing of our us revolving credit facility in july and lower debt levels in fiscal  partially offset by higher interest rates during fiscal income taxes were at an effective tax rate of for fiscal compared to for fiscal the change was primarily due to the impact of the repatriation of earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal discontinued operations resulted from the disposition of our womenswear group operations on june   leading to all womenswear group operations being reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented and diluted earnings from discontinued operations per common share of in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in earnings from gain on sale and discontinued operations was primarily due to the gain on the sale of our womenswear group operations and higher sales in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal the discussion below compares our results of operations for fiscal to fiscal each percentage change provided below reflects the change between these periods unless indicated otherwise 
net sales increased million  or  in fiscal as a result of the sales increases in our menswear group and tommy bahama group discussed below 
the menswear group reported a million  or  increase in net sales in fiscal the change was primarily due to the acquisition of ben sherman  which added sales of million to our net sales in fiscal after our acquisition during that year and the unit sales increase of in our historical menswear business from new marketing initiatives in dress shirts and sport shirts  tailored clothing and the licensed nick it sportswear collection 
these sales increases were partially offset by an average selling price per unit decline of  in our historical menswear business  due to a change in product mix 
the tommy bahama group reported an increase of million  or  in net sales in fiscal despite a reduction in net sales of million due to exiting the private label business 
the increase was primarily due to our ownership of tommy bahama for all weeks of fiscal as compared to of weeks in fiscal  the unit sales increase of  excluding the private label business  the average selling price per unit increase of  excluding the private label business  and an increase in the number of total retail stores from at may  to at june  
table of contents gross profit increased in fiscal the increase was due to higher sales and higher gross margins 
gross margins increased from during fiscal to during fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increased branded sales of the tommy bahama group  which has higher gross margins  the tommy bahama group s exit from the private label business  which had lower gross margins  and the acquisition of ben sherman  which has higher gross margins than our historical menswear business 
our gross profit may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors  as income statement classifications of certain expenses may vary by company 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal sg a was of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a was primarily due to the addition of ben sherman  which has a higher sg a expense structure  expenses associated with opening new retail stores in the tommy bahama group  start up costs associated with new marketing initiatives in our menswear group  and increased auditing and compliance costs primarily related to the requirements resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal the change was primarily the result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the ben sherman acquisition  partially offset by lower amortization amounts related to the tommy bahama group acquisition 
royalties and other operating income increased in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in royalties earned from existing licenses as well as new licenses for the tommy bahama and ben sherman brands 
operating income increased in fiscal the menswear group reported a increase in operating income in fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of ben sherman during fiscal and stronger results in our tailored clothing business 
operating income growth was partially offset by losses related to the start up of new marketing initiatives  weaker performance in our licensed golf business and weaker performance in our private label sportswear and casual slacks business 
the tommy bahama group reported a increase in operating income in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the favorable change in product mix from the lower margin private label business to the higher margin branded business  the higher proportion of sales through our retail stores as opposed to our wholesale distribution channel  which has lower margins that retail distribution  decreased amortization of intangible assets  and increased royalty income from new and existing licenses in fiscal the increased operating income mentioned above was partially offset by higher marketing expenses  including million related to our title sponsorship in the pga tommy bahama challenge golf tournament and increased sg a related to opening new retail stores 
the corporate and other operating loss increased in fiscal the increase in the operating loss was primarily due to increased parent company expenses partially offset by lifo inventory accounting 
interest expense  net increased in fiscal the increase in interest expense was due to the interest on debt incurred to finance the acquisition of ben sherman and the non cash write off of million 
table of contents of deferred financing costs resulting from the modification of our us revolving credit facility in the first quarter of fiscal associated with the ben sherman acquisition 
income taxes were at an effective tax rate of for fiscal compared to for fiscal variations in the effective tax rate were primarily attributable to the acquisition of ben sherman during fiscal additionally  we received refunds of prior year state taxes  recorded a decrease in certain contingent tax liabilities and had a change in the relative distribution of pre tax earnings among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
discontinued operations resulted from the disposition of our womenswear group operations on june   leading to all womenswear operations being reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented and diluted net earnings from discontinued operations per common share of in fiscal and in fiscal the lower earnings from discontinued operations was primarily due to lower sales in fiscal compared to fiscal financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary source of revenue and cash flow is our operating activities in the united states and to some extent the united kingdom 
when cash inflows are less than cash outflows  subject to their terms  we also have access to amounts under our us revolver and us revolver  each of which are described below 
we may seek to finance future capital investment programs through various methods  including  but not limited to  cash flow from operations  borrowings under our current or additional credit facilities and sales of equity securities 
our liquidity requirements arise from the funding of our working capital needs  which include inventory  other operating expenses and accounts receivable  funding of capital expenditures  payment of quarterly dividends  repayment of our indebtedness and acquisitions  if any 
generally  our product purchases are acquired through trade letters of credit which are drawn against our lines of credit at the time of shipment of the products and reduce the amounts available under our lines of credit when issued 
cash and cash equivalents on hand was million at june  compared to million at june  operating activities during fiscal  our continuing operations generated million of cash 
the increase in operating cash flows was primarily a result of the earnings from continuing operations for the period adjusted for non cash activities such as depreciation  amortization and stock compensation for restricted stock awards and changes in working capital accounts 
the changes in working capital accounts included lower amounts of inventories  slightly lower amounts of receivables  higher amounts of non current liabilities including deferred rent and deferred compensation and decreases in current liabilities 
during fiscal  we generated cash flows from continuing operations of million 
this cash was generated primarily from revenues from the sale of our products net of cash paid for the cost of goods sold  general and administrative operating expenses and interest expense adjusted for non cash activities such as depreciation  amortization and stock compensation for restricted stock awards and changes in working capital accounts 
the changes in working capital accounts included higher levels of inventory  accounts receivable  other non current assets  current liabilities and other non current liabilities 
our working capital ratio  which is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities  was and at june  and june   respectively 
the improvement was due to the significant reduction of current liabilities related to continuing operations primarily accounts payable and additional acquisition cost payable partially offset by a decrease in current assets related to continuing operations due to the decrease in inventories between periods  each as discussed below 

table of contents receivables were million and million at june  and june   respectively  representing a decrease of 
days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable related to continuing operations  excluding retail sales  was days and days at june  and june   respectively 
inventories were million and million at june  and june   respectively 
this decrease was primarily a result of a reduction of inventory in our tommy bahama group as we had minimal levels of excess inventory on hand at june  compared to june  additionally  inventory in our historical menswear group decreased compared to june  primarily due to reductions in levels of replenishment program inventory 
our days supply of inventory on hand related to continuing operations  calculated on a trailing twelve month average using a fifo basis  was and days at june  and june   respectively 
prepaid expenses were million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to us having more retail stores and higher prepaid advertising at june  compared to the prior year 
current assets related to discontinued operations were million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the decrease in current assets related to discontinued operations is a result of the disposition of the womenswear group inventory  except for inventory in transit  as of june  we anticipate that substantially all of these current assets will be converted into cash for us during the first quarter of fiscal current liabilities  which primarily consist of payables arising out of our operating activities  were million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the decrease in liabilities related to continuing operations is primarily due to a change in the payment terms of certain of our suppliers during fiscal  the reduction of the earn out liability for fiscal compared to fiscal based on the terms of the agreement and the timing of certain payments  including income taxes and inventory purchases  compared to the prior year 
additionally  included in these amounts are current liabilities related to discontinued operations of million and million at june  and june   which increased primarily as a result of certain costs associated with our disposition of our womenswear group business  including payments to employees of the womenswear group  transaction costs and the tax liability related to the disposition 
deferred income tax liabilities were million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the decrease was primarily a result of changes in property  plant and equipment basis differences  amortization of acquired intangibles  deferred rent and deferred compensation balances 
other non current liabilities  which primarily consist of deferred rent and deferred compensation amounts  were million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the recognition of deferred rent during fiscal as well as the deferral of certain compensation payments to our executives in accordance with our deferred compensation plans 
investing activities during fiscal  investing activities used million in cash 
we paid million for acquisitions in fiscal consisting of the earn out payment in the first quarter of fiscal related to the fiscal tommy bahama group earn out and the payments for the acquisition of the solitude and arnold brant trademarks and related working capital 
additionally  approximately million of capital expenditures were incurred  primarily related to new tommy bahama and ben sherman retail stores

additionally  we incurred capital expenditures of million primarily related to new tommy bahama retail stores  capital expenditures for computer equipment and software and capital expenditures associated with our leased headquarters for our tommy bahama group in seattle  washington and our ben sherman us operations in new york 

table of contents non current assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets and other non current assets increased primarily as a result of the fiscal earn out related to the tommy bahama acquisition  capital expenditures for our retail stores and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these increases were partially offset by depreciation of our fixed assets and amortization of our intangible assets 
financing activities during fiscal  financing activities used approximately million in cash 
the cash flow generated from our operating activities in excess of our investments as well as the proceeds from the disposition of the womenswear group operations were used to repay amounts on our lines of credit during fiscal we also received million of cash provided from the exercise of employee stock options 
these amounts were partially offset by the payment of million of dividends on our common shares during fiscal during fiscal  financing activities generated million in cash 
substantially all of these proceeds represent the funding from the us revolver to finance the ben sherman acquisition on july   partially offset by the million paid in the first quarter of fiscal related to our refinancing of our us revolving credit facility 
additionally  million of cash was provided by the exercise of employee stock options 
these cash proceeds were partially offset by the use of cash to pay million of dividends on our common stock 
on june   we paid a cash dividend of per share to shareholders of record as of may  additionally  on august   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share payable on september  to shareholders of record on august  that dividend is the th consecutive quarterly dividend we have paid since we became a public company in july we expect to pay dividends in future quarters 
however  we may decide to discontinue or modify the dividend payment at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital  including  but not limited to  payment of debt outstanding or funding of future acquisitions  may be in our best interest  if our expectations of future cash flows and future cash needs outweigh the ability to pay a dividend or if the terms of our credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends 
we may borrow to fund dividends in the short term based on our expectations of operating cash flows in future periods 
all cash flow from operations will not necessarily be paid out as dividends in all periods 
debt decreased by million at june  compared to june  primarily as a result of the decrease in the borrowings under the us revolver due to proceeds from our disposition of the operations of our womenswear group on june  and the excess of cash flow from operations over investments during fiscal cash flows from discontinued operations during fiscal and our womenswear group generated cash flow of million and million  respectively 
these cash flows were primarily due to the earnings of the womenswear group  adjusted for any changes in working capital accounts during the year and the proceeds from the disposition of the womenswear group operations in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the table below provides a description of our significant financing arrangements in thousands at june  balance million us secured revolving credit facility us revolver  which accrues interest at june   unused line fees and letter of credit fees based upon a pricing grid tied to certain debt ratios  requires interest payments monthly with principal due at maturity july  and is collateralized by substantially all the assets of our domestic subsidiaries million senior secured revolving credit facility uk revolver  which accrues interest at the bank s base rate plus at june   requires interest payments monthly with principal payable on demand or at maturity july  and is collateralized by substantially all the united kingdom assets of ben sherman million senior unsecured notes senior unsecured notes  which accrue interest at effective rate of  require interest payments semi annually on june and december of each year  require payment of principal at maturity june  are subject to certain prepayment penalties and are guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries other debt  including capital lease obligations with varying terms and conditions  collateralized by the respective assets total debt unamortized discount on senior unsecured notes short term debt and current maturities of long term debt total long term debt  less current maturities the us revolver  the us revolver and the senior unsecured notes each include certain debt covenant restrictions that require us or our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios that are customary for similar facilities 
the us revolver also includes limitations on certain restricted payments such as earn outs  payment of dividends and prepayment of debt 
as of june   we were compliant with all financial covenants and restricted payment provisions related to our debt agreements 
the us revolver and us revolver are used to finance trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit as well as provide funding for other operating activities and acquisitions 
as of june   approximately million of trade letters of credit and other limitations on availability were outstanding against the us revolver and the us revolver 
the aggregate net availability under our us revolver and us revolver agreements was approximately million as of june  our debt to total capitalization ratio was and at june  and june   respectively 
the change in this ratio was primarily a result of cash flows from operations during fiscal and the disposition of the operations of the womenswear group on june  we anticipate that the amount of debt  as well as the ratio of debt to total capitalization  will remain comparable to the balance at june  in future periods  unless we make additional acquisitions or investments 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements  which generally consist of working capital needs  capital expenditures primarily for the opening of tommy bahama and ben sherman retail stores and interest payments on our debt during fiscal  primarily from cash on hand and cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings under our lines of credit  as necessary 
our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally existing from the late second quarter to early fourth quarter of each year as we build inventory for the spring summer season 
our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the need to finance increased inventory levels and the success of our various products 
if appropriate investment opportunities arise that exceed the availability under our existing credit facilities  we believe that we will be able to fund such acquisitions through additional or refinanced debt facilities or the issuance of additional equity 
however  our ability to obtain additional borrowings or refinance 
table of contents our credit facilities will depend on many factors  including the prevailing market conditions  our financial condition and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
there is no assurance that financing would be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
at maturity of the uk revolver  the uk revolver and the senior unsecured notes  we anticipate that we will be able to refinance the facilities and debt with terms available in the market at that time

our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to approximate million 
these expenditures will consist primarily of the continued expansion of our retail operations of the tommy bahama group and ben sherman brand  including the opening of additional retail stores 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into agreements which meet the sec s definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement  other than operating leases  and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation and other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies 
however  in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below  our consolidated statements of earnings could be misstated 
the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods we use 

table of contents revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue consists of sales to wholesale customers  retail store and restaurant revenues and royalties 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for sales within our wholesale operations  we consider a completed purchase order or some form of electronic communication from the customer requesting the goods persuasive evidence of an agreement 
for substantially all our wholesale sales  our products are considered delivered at the time that the products are shipped as substantially all products are sold based on fob shipping point terms 
this generally coincides with the time that title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
for certain transactions in which the goods do not pass through our distribution centers and title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass at the time the goods leave the foreign port  revenue is recognized at that time 
in certain cases in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
in the normal course of business we offer certain discounts or allowances to our wholesale customers 
wholesale operations sales are recorded net of such discounts  allowances  advertising support not specifically relating to the reimbursement for actual advertising expenses by our customers and provisions for estimated returns 
as certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season  program or other event which may not have occurred yet  we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis considering historical and current trends  projected seasonal results and other factors 
we record the discounts  returns and allowances as a reduction to net sales in our consolidated statements of earnings 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken as a reduction to accounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
such amounts are written off at the time that the amounts are not considered collectible 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and uncollectible chargebacks based on our historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends 
we record such charges and write offs to selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings 
retail store and restaurant revenues are recorded  net of estimated returns  at the time of sale to consumers 
retail store and restaurant revenues are recorded net of applicable sales taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings 
royalties  which are generally based on a percentage of the licensee s actual net sales or minimum net sales  are recorded based upon contractually guaranteed minimum levels and adjusted as sales data is received from licensees 
we may receive initial payments for the grant of license rights  which are recognized as revenue over the term of the license agreement 
royalty income is included in royalties and other income in our consolidated statements of earnings 
inventories for segment reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market  with all adjustments being charged to operations in the period in which the facts giving rise to the adjustments become known 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories for identification of distressed inventory 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods 
for retail inventory  we provide an allowance for shrinkage and goods expected to be sold below cost 
each of these estimates are based on our historical experience as well as an assessment of the inventory quantity  quality and mix  consumer and retailer preferences and the current market conditions 
for consolidated financial reporting  significant portions of our inventories are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market 
lifo inventory calculations are made on a legal entity basis which does not correspond to our segment definitions 
therefore  lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the 
table of contents respective operating segments 
as part of lifo accounting  markdowns for inventory valued at lifo cost are deferred until the period in which the goods are sold 
however  in non routine circumstances  such as discontinuance of a product line  markdowns below the allocated lifo reserve are not deferred 
both the lifo reserve and the markdown deferral are reflected in our corporate and other financial information in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report and in the results of operations in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill  net goodwill is recognized as the amount that the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition 
such goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill includes valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparables which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of goodwill balances  the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets  net at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consist of trademarks and trade names  license agreements and customer relationships 
the fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases 
such valuation may include a discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated revenues or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset 
amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  which consist of license agreements  customer relationships and covenants not to compete  is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
asset lives used for our intangible assets range from to years 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts  an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of intangible assets with indefinite lives includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the fair values of trademarks are estimated on an annual basis utilizing the relief from royalty method 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled 
our policy is to recognize net deferred tax assets  whose realization is dependent on taxable earnings in future years  when a greater than probability exists that the tax benefits will actually be realized sometime in the future 
also  we provide for a reserve for items when a greater than probability exists that a tax deduction taken would be disallowed under examination by the taxing authority 
no material valuation allowances have been recognized in our financial statements 
at june   we have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million which have been provided for in our income tax provision as the earnings are not considered permanently invested outside of the united states 
if the earnings were repatriated to the united states  the earnings will be subject to united states taxation at that time 
the amount of deferred tax liability recognized associated with 
table of contents the undistributed earnings was approximately million at june   representing the approximate excess of the united states tax liability over the creditable foreign taxes paid that would result from a full remittance of undistributed earnings 
we receive a united states income tax benefit upon the exercise of the majority of our employee stock options 
the benefit is equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock at the time of the exercise and the option price  times the approximate tax rate 
we record the benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options as a reduction to current income taxes payable and a credit directly to shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements 
seasonality although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be highly seasonal 
for example  the demand for golf and tommy bahama products is higher in the spring and summer seasons 
products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
the percentage of net sales from continuing operations by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  and the percentage of operating income by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  which may not be indicative of the distribution in future years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our indebtedness  which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
our objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow  primarily through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
this assessment also considers our need for flexibility in our borrowing arrangements resulting from the seasonality of our business  among other factors 
we continuously monitor interest rates to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities in order to determine whether we have achieved our interest rate management objectives 
as of june   approximately million of debt outstanding or of our total debt was subject to variable interest rates  with a weighted average rate of approximately 
our average variable rate borrowings for fiscal were million  with an average interest rate of during the period 
our lines of credit are based on variable interest rates in order to take advantage of the lower rates available in the current interest rate environment and to provide the necessary borrowing flexibility required 
to the extent that the amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credit change  our exposure to changes in interest rates would also change 
if our average interest rate for fiscal increased by basis points  our interest expense would have been approximately million higher during the fiscal year 
due to the disposition of our womenswear group operations on june   we anticipate having lower levels of debt in future periods than we had during the course of fiscal  unless we acquire additional businesses 
at june   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt and capital lease obligations outstanding with substantially all the debt  consisting of our senior unsecured notes  having an effective interest rate of and maturing in june such agreements may result in higher interest expense than could be obtained under variable interest rate arrangements in certain periods  but are primarily intended to provide long term financing of our capital structure and minimize our exposure to increases in interest rates 
a change in the market interest rate impacts the fair value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 

table of contents none of our debt was entered into for speculative purposes 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk and do not enter into such transactions on a speculative basis 
trade policy risk pursuant to the agreement on textiles and clothing  quotas among world trade organization  or wto  member countries  including the united states  were eliminated on january  as a result  the international textile and apparel trade is undergoing a significant realignment which is changing our sourcing patterns  could disrupt our supply chain and could put us at a disadvantage to our competitors 
in addition  notwithstanding quota elimination  under the terms of china s wto accession agreement  the united states and other wto members may re impose quotas on specific categories of products in the event it is determined that imports from china have surged or may surge and are threatening to create a market disruption for such categories of products so called safeguard quota 
pursuant to this authority  both the united states and the european union re imposed quotas on several important product categories from china during calendar subsequent to the imposition of safeguard quotas  both the united states and china negotiated bilateral quota agreements that cover a number of important product categories and will remain in place until december  in the case of the us china bilateral agreement and until december  in the case of the european union china bilateral agreement 
the establishment of these quotas could cause disruption in our supply chain 
furthermore  under long standing statutory authority applicable to imported goods in general  the united states may unilaterally impose additional duties i when imported merchandise is sold at less than fair value and causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as anti dumping duties  or ii when foreign producers receive certain types of governmental subsidies  and when the importation of their subsidized goods causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as countervailing duties 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duties on products we import would increase the cost of those products to us 
we may not be able to pass on any such cost increase to our customers 
foreign currency risk to the extent that we have assets and liabilities  as well as operations  denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we view our foreign investments as long term and as a result we generally do not hedge such foreign investments 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exposure for speculative purposes 
we receive united states dollars for most of our product sales 
less than of our net sales during fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
these sales primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe and sales of certain products in canada 
with the united states dollar trading at a weaker position than it has historically traded versus the pound sterling and the canadian dollar  a strengthening united states dollar could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of earnings in future periods  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts as previously reported 
based on our fiscal sales denominated in foreign currencies  if the dollar had strengthened by in fiscal  we would have experienced a decrease in sales of approximately million 
substantially all of our inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies  such as the chinese yuan  of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  we cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future costs 
however  we do not believe that exchange rate fluctuations will have a material impact on our inventory costs in future periods 

table of contents we may from time to time purchase short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates  but at june   we have not entered into any such agreements that have not been settled 
when such contracts are outstanding  the contracts are marked to market with the offset being recognized in our consolidated statement of earnings or other comprehensive income if the transaction does not or does  respectively  qualify as a hedge in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
commodity and inflation risk we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials and finished goods and increased operating costs to the extent that any such fluctuations are not reflected by adjustments in the selling prices of our products 
also  in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices in our private label businesses 
while we have been successful to some extent in offsetting such deflationary pressures through product improvements and lower costs  if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain further price reductions  our profitability may be adversely affected 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each business unit through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
we do not enter into significant long term sales or purchase contracts and we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such risk
