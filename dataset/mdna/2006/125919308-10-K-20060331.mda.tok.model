business operations our operations consist of the design and production of structural aircraft parts principally for the united states air force and other branches of the us armed forces

we compete with other prime contractors to win contracts through a process of competitive bidding 
additionally  we bid on subcontract work to leading aerospace prime contractors 
this is a field of opportunity that has opened up to us over the past two years 
after winning a contract  the length of the contract varies but is typically between one and two years for us government contracts although our t contract and our c top contract are for periods of years and years  respectively  and up to years for commercial contracts 
our one commercial contract has an indefinite life 
except in cases where contract terms permit us to bill on a progress basis  we must incur upfront costs in producing assemblies and bill our customers upon delivery 
because of the upfront costs incurred  the timing of our billings and the nature of the percentage of completion method of accounting described below  there can be a significant disparity between the periods in which a costs are expended  b revenue and earnings are recorded and c cash is received

under the poc method of accounting  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract 
recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract 
estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in cost of sales in the period the change becomes known 
the use of the poc method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods 
as a result  there can be a significant disparity between earnings both for accounting and taxes as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period 
we continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the poc method of accounting  however  we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate 
if our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated  we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods 
furthermore  even if our estimates are accurate  we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay taxes until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts

if these events are not forthcoming  we plan on reassessing this position

these costs are components of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts on our balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed 
these costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms 
because the poc method of accounting requires us to use estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods  there can be a significant disparity between earnings both for accounting and taxes as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period 
accordingly  it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts
