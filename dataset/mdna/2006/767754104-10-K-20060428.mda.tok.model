item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net income for fiscal was  million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal  and million  or per diluted share in fiscal our operating results are described in detail in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this item however  some of the key factors that impacted our results in fiscal   and are summarized as follows income tax valuation allowance adjustment 
net income included a benefit of  million  or per diluted share during fiscal and million  or per diluted share during fiscal related to the recognition of net deferred tax assets as a result of the release of a tax valuation allowance 
based upon a review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we can generate sustainable consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future  we concluded at the end of fiscal that the majority of the net deferred tax assets would be utilized 
thus  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we recorded a tax benefit during fiscal releasing a majority of the remaining valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of  million 
based upon the then available factors at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit for a portion of our net deferred tax assets by releasing a portion of our valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of million during fiscal as of march   we maintain a valuation allowance of million against remaining net deferred tax assets 
sales trends 
our revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal was and for fiscal compared to fiscal was 
factors affecting our growth are discussed more thoroughly in the results of operations section of this item significant factors negatively impacting our revenue were customer concerns over the safety of certain categories of drugs  changes in various states medicaid coverages  a higher level of prescriptions using generic drugs and lower reimbursement rates  including the new medicare part d program 
another significant factor negatively effecting our revenue growth was the continuing penetration of mail order prescription programs  particularly the mandatory mail program that the united auto workers implemented beginning january additionally  our revenue growth was negatively effected by difficult comparisons to prior year revenues for our stores in southern california that benefited from the effects of a strike at several southern california grocery chains that ended march as described in the strategy section of item of this form k  we are taking steps to offset these negative factors by working to increase sales at our existing stores through improved customer service and developing new and relocated stores in our strongest markets 
compared to the prior year  our revenue declined by in the first quarter and grew   and in the second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal was impacted by an extra week  as fiscal was a fifty three week year 
the impact of this fifty third week was 
however  we expect our revenue results to continue to face significant pressures from the existing competitive environment 
hurricane katrina 
on august   hurricane katrina made landfall in louisiana and proceeded to move through mississippi and alabama  causing one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the united states 
as of march   we had stores that remained closed 
we are still assessing whether to rebuild or re open these stores  and do not expect these stores to be re opened or rebuilt until sometime in fiscal or after 
during fiscal  we incurred costs and damages related to hurricane katrina of million 
these costs and damages included the write off of inventory and long lived assets at net book value  relief and other payments to associates and other clean up costs 
in addition  we incurred million of costs relating to the major remodeling and reconstruction of certain of the impacted stores 
we maintain insurance coverage which provides for reimbursement from losses resulting from property damage  including flood  loss of product and business interruption 
the insurance coverage is for current replacement value  less certain deductible amounts depending on the nature of the loss and number of occurances 
as of march   we received advance payments of million from our insurance carriers 
the excess of advance payments over the amounts written off of million represents a deferred gain  and was included in other non current liabilities 
the million of costs relating to the major remodeling and reconstruction of certain of the impacted stores was included in construction in progress 
the impact of hurricane katrina on our sales and operating results for fiscal was not material 
debt refinancing and receivables securitization 
in fiscal years  and  we took several steps to improve our leverage  extend the terms of a substantial amount of our debt  lower our interest rates and obtain more flexibility 
in fiscal  we amended our senior secured credit facility to consist solely of a billion revolving credit facility  paid at maturity the remaining outstanding principal on two existing notes and completed the early redemption of another existing note 
as a result of amending our senior secured credit facility and the early redemption of an existing note  we recorded a loss on debt modifications of million 
in fiscal  we replaced our senior secured credit facility with a new credit facility  entered into receivable securitization agreements  issued new senior secured notes  and repurchased portions of several existing notes prior to maturity 
as a result of entering into the new senior secured credit facility and the receivables securitization agreements  we recorded a loss on debt modifications of million  offset by net gains of million related to the note repurchases described above 
in fiscal  we replaced our then existing senior secured credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility  issued new senior notes and repurchased portions of several existing notes prior to maturity 
these activities resulted in a loss of million related to the termination of the old senior secured credit facility  offset by net gains of million related to the note repurchases described above 
these steps and our operating cash flow have enabled us to reduce our debt from billion as of march  to billion as of march  these transactions are discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
dilutive equity issuances 
at march   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible notes and preferred stock 
our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consist of the following shares in thousands strike price outstanding stock options a convertible notes b preferred stock total shares in thousands and under to and over total issuable shares a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million b the conversion of these notes to equity would reduce the principal amount of debt by million results of operations revenue and other operating data year ended march  weeks february  weeks february  weeks dollars in thousands revenues revenue growth same store sales growth pharmacy sales growth same store pharmacy sales growth pharmacy sales as a of total sales third party sales as a of total pharmacy sales front end sales growth same store front end sales growth front end sales as a of total sales store data total stores beginning of period new stores closed stores store acquisitions  net total stores end of period remodeled stores relocated stores same store sales for fiscal are calculated by comparing the week period ended march  with the week period ended march  revenues fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by front end sales growth of and pharmacy sales growth of 
sales growth in front end and pharmacy was driven by increases in same store sales  which are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below  and by the additional week in fiscal we include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocated stores are not included in same store sales 
fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased by  due to an increase in price per prescription  offset by an increase in generic sales  lower reimbursement rates  including the lower reimbursement rates from the new medicare part d program  and a decrease in the number of prescriptions filled 
the decrease in the number of prescriptions filled was due primarily to certain third party payors requiring or encouraging customers to use mail order  competitor growth in our markets  changes in medicaid coverages  safety concerns in antiarthritic  psychotherapeutic and hormone therapy prescriptions and a milder cough  cold and flu season than the prior year 
fiscal front end same store sales increased by  primarily as a result of improvement in our core categories such as over the counter  health and beauty care and consumable and food products partially offset by a decrease in photo and film sales and the decrease in categories negatively impacted by a milder cough  cold and flu season

this reduction in prescriptions filled is due primarily to certain third party payors requiring or encouraging customers to use mail order  safety concerns in antiarthritic  psychotherapeutic and hormone therapy prescriptions  the movement of certain prescription drugs to over the counter and a milder cough  cold and flu season than in the prior year 
the lower rate of increase in fiscal is also partially attributable to our southern california stores benefiting from an increase in business in fiscal related to a union strike at several grocery store chains 
fiscal front end same store sales increased  primarily as a result of improvement in our consumable  over the counter and health and beauty care categories  partially offset by a decrease in photo and film sales  sales decreases in categories negatively impacted by a milder cough  cold and flu season and decreased traffic in stores that were negatively impacted by mail order programs

this difference in the lifo charge from fiscal to fiscal decreased gross margin by

these items were partially offset by a decrease in self insurance expense for general liability insurance and a million accrual reversal resulting from the united states attorney closing its investigation involving matters related to prior management s business practices 
sg a expense for fiscal was as a percentage of revenues  compared to for fiscal increased costs for pharmacy labor  union sponsored benefits and increased advertising and bad debt expenses were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation expense and professional fees  decreased self insurance expense for general liability insurance  decreased depreciation and amortization costs resulting from certain store equipment and intangible assets becoming completely depreciated and amortized in the current year and a decrease in stock based compensation expense  which was primarily due to awards granted becoming fully vested in the prior year 
store closing and impairment charges store closing and impairment charges consist of year ended march  weeks february  weeks february  weeks dollars in thousands impairment charges store and equipment lease exit charges credits impairment charges 
in fiscal   and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the impairment of long lived assets at   and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were identified for impairment as part of our on going store performance review at all of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close the store 
store and equipment lease exit charges credits 
in fiscal   and  we recorded charges for   and stores  respectively  to be closed or relocated under long term leases 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
this liability is discounted using a risk free rate of interest 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
the effect of adjustments to the risk free rate of interest and an increase in the number of stores for which a store closing charge was taken caused an increase in our store lease exit charge in fiscal over fiscal the effect of adjustments to the risk free rate of interest and the reversal of reserves established for stores that were previously committed for closure by management  but ultimately were not closed  resulted in a net credit for fiscal as part of our ongoing business activities  we will continue to assess stores for potential closure 
there can be no assurance that other such actions may not be required in the future  or that such actions would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period in which we take those actions 
interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to decreases in outstanding borrowings and a lower interest rate on our amended senior secured credit facility partially offset by an extra week in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to the lower outstanding balance and lower interest rate on our senior secured credit facility resulting from the fiscal refinancing 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were   and respectively 
income taxes income tax benefits of  million  million and million have been recorded for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal benefit was primarily comprised of a federal and state tax benefit of  million for the release of valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that have an expected future utilization 
the fiscal benefit was comprised of a tax benefit of million offset by tax expense of million consisting primarily of state income taxes 
the fiscal and benefits were principally the result of a reduction of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets that were previously fully reserved 
the fiscal benefit was comprised of a federal tax benefit of million and state tax expense of million 
the federal tax benefit was related to the conclusion of the internal revenue service examination for fiscal years through  representing recoverable federal and state income taxes and interest  as well as a reduction of previously recorded liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments 
based upon a review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we can generate sustainable consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future  we concluded at the end of fiscal that the majority of the net deferred tax assets would be utilized 
thus  pursuant to sfas no 
 we recorded a tax benefit during fiscal releasing a majority of the remaining valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of  million 
based upon the then available factors at the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit for a portion of our net deferred tax assets by releasing a portion of our valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of million during fiscal until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets and continue to maintain a valuation allowance of million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end the majority of the valuation allowance relates to state net operating loss carryforwards 
we underwent an ownership change for statutory tax purposes during fiscal  which resulted in a limitation on the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
this limitation was considered when determining the required level for the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources general we have five primary sources of liquidity i cash and cash equivalents  ii cash provided by operating activities  iii the sale of accounts receivable under our receivable securitization agreements  iv the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility  and v sale leasebacks of owned property 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to provide funds for capital expenditures and to provide funds for payment and repurchase of our debt

cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  due to the amending of our credit facility and principal payments on long term debt 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  due to the amending of our credit facility and early redemption of several bonds 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal cash usage related to the amending of our credit facility  the early redemption of several bonds and payments on certain bonds at maturity was largely offset by proceeds from bond issuances 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million to million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to new store construction  store relocation  store remodel and store improvement projects  related to technology enhancements  improvements to distribution centers  and other corporate requirements  and approximately related to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacies 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from sale leaseback transactions 
in fiscal  we resumed our new store and store relocation program 
in fiscal  our goal is to open or relocate approximately stores 
approximately of the stores will be relocated or expanded stores and the remaining will be new stores 
the program is focused on our strongest existing markets 
we also expect to continue remodeling stores in fiscal future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon current levels of operations and planned improvements in our operating performance  management believes that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility  sales of accounts receivable under our securitization agreements and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated annual requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
the restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness in our senior secured credit facility and several of our bond indentures may limit our ability to obtain additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard requires companies to account for share based payments to associates using the fair value method of expense recognition 
fair value for stock options can be calculated using either a closed form or open form calculation method 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize option expense over the requisite service period of the award  net of an estimate for the impact of award forfeitures 
sfas no 
r is required to be adopted as of the first fiscal year beginning after december  we had previously adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation effective march  and had been recognizing expense on a ratable basis related to share based payments to associates using the fair value method 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r effective march  using the modified prospective transition method 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
r will also require us to change the classification of any tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of that which is associated with the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes 
these amounts will be presented as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of income taxes paid in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin states that a conditional asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity 
fin was effective no later than the end of fiscal years ended after december  and accordingly  we have adopted fin the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific translation provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and error corrections occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to simplify accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation 
certain of our public bonds contain an early call option that meets the definition of a hybrid financial instrument 
however  these instruments are not required to be bifurcated from the host contracts and therefore the provisions set forth in sfas no 
are not applicable to these instruments 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets 
this standard is required to be adopted as of the first fiscal year beginning after september  we may be required to recognize a servicing asset or liability related to our securitization agreements 
we have not quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
 but do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management allowance for uncollectible receivables the majority of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be recorded 
inventory included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrink  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates that our reserves are based on  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including stores and excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the store s assets 
cash flows are calculated utilizing individual store forecasts and total company projections for the remaining estimated lease lives of the stores being analyzed 
should actual results differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to these facilities 
goodwill impairment as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our test as of march  resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
self insurance liabilities we record estimates for self insured medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage with assistance from actuaries 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that are calculated under the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are based on market interest rates  and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the accumulated benefit obligation of the defined benefit plans is a discounted amount calculated using the discount rate from published high quality long term bond indices  the terms of which approximate the term of the cash flows to pay the accumulated benefit obligations when due 
an increase in the market interest rates  assuming no other changes in the estimates  reduces the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation and the related required expense 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  that are present valued at current risk free interest rates  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  and anticipated future subleases of properties 
if interest rates or the real estate leasing markets change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel  and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of march  thereafter total fair value at march  long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings on this facility are libor plus for the revolving credit facility 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of as of march  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately million on march  a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 
in addition to the financial instruments listed above  the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our receivables securitization agreements are determined based on libor
