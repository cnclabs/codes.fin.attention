since april  we have been working with the consortium for technology licensing ltd 
to explore opportunities to license or sell our patents 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we generated a million gain from the sale of patents that related to legacy products that neomagic no longer sells 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we announced a patent licensing transaction with sony corporation where sony paid us million for a non exclusive license to all of our patents 
in the patent licensing transaction with sony  we only provided sony with a license to our patents 
we did not provide sony with any intellectual know how or other confidential information that could help sony develop products that could be competitive with neomagic s products 
as of april   we were in discussions with multiple companies that we believe have infringed on our embedded dram patents 
the objective of our patent licensing business is to enter into patent licensing agreements with companies that have infringed or are expected to infringe on our patents 
in addition  we may decide to license or sell certain additional patents in the future 
licensing revenue was million in fiscal representing of our total revenue 
there was no licensing revenue in fiscal and fiscal our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in january 
for ease of presentation  the accompanying financial statements have been shown as ending on january and calendar quarter ends for all annual and quarterly 
table of contents financial statement captions 
fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on january  fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january  fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january critical accounting policies and estimates neomagic s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets and long lived assets  revenue recognition  inventories and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenue and expenses and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
fair value of equity instruments the valuation of certain items  including valuation of warrants  and compensation expense related to stock options granted  involves significant estimations with underlying assumptions judgmentally determined 
the valuation of warrants and stock options are based upon a black scholes valuation model  which involve estimates of stock volatility and other assumptions 
the estimates we believe present the best form of estimating fair value 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in the market value of the assets  significant reductions in projected future cash flows or gross margins  or macroeconomic factors including a prolonged economic downturn 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we will be required to write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including gross profit margins  long term forecasts of the amount and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down or write off long lived assets 
we continue to periodically evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas and acknowledge it is possible that such evaluation might result in future adjustments for impairment 
such an impairment might adversely affect our operating results 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two principal sources product sales and license fees for patents 

table of contents we recognize revenue from non distributor product sales when the products are shipped to the customer  title has transferred  and no obligations remain 
in addition  we require the following criteria to be met before recognizing revenue i execution of a written customer order  ii shipment of the product  iii fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
our shipment terms are fob shipping point 
for products shipped to distributors  we defer recognition of product revenue until the distributors sell our products to their customers 
on occasion  however  we may sell products with end of life status to our distributors under special arrangements without any price protection or return privileges for which we recognize revenue upon transfer of title  typically upon shipment 
at the end of each accounting period  we determine certain factors  including sales returns and allowances  that could affect the amount of revenue recorded for the period 
sales returns provisions include considerations for known but unprocessed sales returns and estimates for unknown returns based on our historical experiences 
we recognize non refundable fees for licensing our patents in the period when all of the following conditions are met i we enter into a licensing agreement with a licensee that has been executed by both parties  ii delivery has occurred and we have no further obligations regarding the licensing agreement  iii the fee is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
inventory valuation our inventory valuation policy stipulates that at the end of each reporting period we write down or write off our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
the amount of the write down or write off is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
additionally  as we introduce product enhancements and new products  demand for our existing products in inventory may decrease  requiring additional inventory write downs 
deferred taxes and tax accruals we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that we would be able to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period when such determination was made 
we have also provided accruals for certain tax liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  or less than currently assessed  the resulting reversal of such accruals would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period when the accruals are no longer deemed necessary 
conversely  if our estimate of tax liabilities is more than the amount ultimately assessed  further charges would result 
results of operations product revenue product revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the large decrease in product revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to decreased shipments of our mimagic applications processor 
the increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to increased shipments of approximately million of our mimagic applications processor for the handheld devices market 
we expect that the percentage of our net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period when new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 

table of contents sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states  and foreign manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of product revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of product revenue 
all sales transactions were denominated in united states dollars 
the following is a summary of our product revenue by major geographic area year ended january  japan taiwan hong kong singapore united states england sweden the following customers accounted for more than of product revenue year ended january  edom technology co 
exadigm inc premier microelectronics europe ltd silicon media  inc ess technology international  inc macnica  inc silicon alliance int 
represents less than of product revenue customer is a distributor licensing revenue on september   we granted sony corporation of tokyo  japan a worldwide  non exclusive license to all of our patents 
in accordance with the agreement  we received gross proceeds of million 
among the patents that were licensed to sony corporation are those that relate to the use of embedded dynamic random access memory dram technology and on chip memories in semiconductor integrated circuits 
revenue from sony accounted for of our license revenue and of our total revenue in fiscal during the negotiations that led to the signed agreement  neomagic was represented by the consortium for technology licensing  ltd  of nissequogue  new york 
neomagic and the consortium continue to explore other opportunities to generate additional revenue from neomagic s patents 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so 
gross profit loss gross profit loss was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
cost of revenue includes amortization of deferred compensation of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
there was no amortization of deferred compensation in fiscal gross profit for fiscal year reflects licensing revenue of million partially offset by the cost of licensing revenue of million  which includes legal and other expenses and a commission payment to the consortium for technology licensing  ltd 
of approximately million 
gross profit on license revenues was of license revenue in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by charges of million to write off excess inventory primarily for our mimagic applications processor and favorably impacted by the sale of million 
table of contents of inventory previously written off 
the increased negative margins in fiscal were largely due to the write off of excess mimagic inventory of approximately million 
fiscal excess inventory write offs were approximately million primarily related to our nmc companion chip and our mimagic applications processor 
in addition  fiscal gross loss included million of amortization of licensed intellectual property as well as a million impairment charge for licensed intellectual property 
the negative gross margin in fiscal is generally due to under absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from relatively low production levels 
in the future  our gross margin percentages may be affected by the mix of product revenue and licensing revenue  increased competition and related decline in unit average product selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  changes in the mix of products sold  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from our suppliers  inventory write offs  and manufacturing yields particularly on new products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include compensation and associated costs relating to research and development personnel  amortization of intangible assets and prototyping costs  which are comprised of photomask costs and pre production wafer costs 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we have made  and intend to continue to make  significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products to serve our identified markets 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal of million is primarily related to lower labor costs of million due to lower headcount  decreased amortization of intellectual property of million  decreased mask costs of million  and lower software license and maintenance costs of million  and lower allocated costs of million primarily related to reduced headcount 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal of million is primarily related to lower depreciation of million due to certain fixed assets being fully depreciated throughout fiscal year  lower outside consultant costs of million and lower allocation costs of million due to lower allocated it department depreciation and other allocated costs 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to decreased labor costs of million resulting from reduced headcount and lower financial auditing costs partially offset by increased professional service costs of million 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal due to increased labor costs of million mainly due to reinstatement of salaries after a one year reduction  and increased audit fees of million offset by decreased cost of boards used to demonstrate neomagic products of million and lower allocation costs of million 
audit expenses increased in fiscal due to increased procedures required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of gain on sale of patents on april   neomagic completed the sale of selected patents to faust communications  llc  a private company  for net proceeds of approximately million 
the gross proceeds in the transaction were approximately million 
expenses included a commission payment of approximately million 
the patents sold related to products no longer sold by neomagic and not to products that neomagic currently sells or plans to sell 
neomagic retained a worldwide  non exclusive license under the patents sold 
the sale did not include several of neomagic s important patents covering embedded dram technology nor any of the unique array processing technology used in neomagic s mimagic and neomobiletv products 

table of contents during the patent sale negotiations  neomagic was represented by the consortium for technology licensing  ltd  of nissequogue  new york  a company whose ceo served on the board of neomagic until december on march   neomagic entered into an amended and restated patent licensing agreement with the consortium governing the relationship between the two parties 
impairment of certain acquired and licensed intangible assets in accordance with sfas  we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever there are indicators of impairment  by comparing projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets against their respective carrying amounts to determine whether impairment exists 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
during fiscal  we determined that certain licensed intellectual property was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million of which million was charged to cost of sales 
the impairment was caused by a decline in the related sales forecasts of products associated with the licensed intellectual property 
interest income and other we earn interest on our cash and short term investments 
interest income and other was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to increased interest rates 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to lower average cash and short term investment balances 
interest expense interest expense was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is due to interest expense of million for accretion related to our mandatorily redeemable series b convertible preferred stock and interest expense recorded for the previously unrecognized debt discount upon the conversion of mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock in december in addition  we recorded interest expense of million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to our mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock and for expensing the previously unrecognized deferred financing costs upon the conversion our mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock in december the increase in fiscal is due to accreted interest expense of million recorded in fiscal related to our mandatorily redeemable series b convertible preferred stock  which was originally issued in august in addition  we recorded  of interest amortization for deferred financing costs related to our mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock during fiscal income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year  which consisted of foreign income taxes  accrued interest and penalties on state and foreign tax liabilities  and a decrease in tax reserves 
our effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal year  the tax benefit rate differed from the statutory rate due primarily to an increase in our valuation allowance and decrease in the tax reserves 
realization of our deferred tax assets  which have a full valuation allowance  depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  the management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is required as of january  the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for 
table of contents the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
however  as the company is currently in nol position  it has opted not to currently reinvest in the united states  as the temporary deduction is provided outside the scope of existing nols and would create an additional tax liability in the united states 
the time for obtaining this benefit has expired 
the earnings from foreign operations in india are currently tax exempt pursuant to a tax holiday effective through the incentive provides for certain tax relief if certain conditions are met 
we believe that we continued to be in compliance with these conditions at january  liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  million  and million as of the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments from january  to january  stems primarily from the december sale and issuance of common stock shares and warrants for net proceeds of million 
in addition  our operating loss for fiscal was partially offset by net licensing revenue of million and the gain on the sale of patents of million 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in fiscal stems primarily from our operating loss partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants 
cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to net loss of million  the gain on sale of patents of million and decrease in income taxes payable of million partially offset by non cash depreciation  amortization and accretion of million  and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities of million 
the cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the million net loss offset in part by non cash depreciation and amortization of million and an impairment charge for certain licensed intellectual property of million 
the cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the million net loss and decreases in accounts payable of million and decreases in other accruals of million  offset in part by non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily due to net maturities of short term investments of million and proceeds from the sale of patents of million 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily due to net maturities of short term investments of million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was due to net purchases of short term investments of million and purchases of property  plant  equipment and intangibles of million 
continued operation of our business may require higher levels of capital equipment purchases  technology investments  foundry investments and other payments to secure manufacturing capacity 
the timing and amount of future investments will depend primarily on the level of our future revenues 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we closed the sale and issuance in a private placement of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share for an aggregate offering price of million 
net proceeds after deducting transaction costs were million 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal is due to the net proceeds from this financing of million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee plans of million partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations of million 
in fiscal  we issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock  series a warrants for the purchase of  shares of common stock at per share and series b warrants warrants to purchase  shares 
table of contents of common stock at per share in a private placement for net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds were used to fund operating activities 
the preferred stock was converted into  shares of our common stock in december the series b warrants to purchase  shares of common stock expired unexercised in december in connection with the december private financing described above  the anti dilution adjustments in the warrants were triggered 
as a result  the series a warrants are now exercisable for  shares at an exercise price of per share 
see note  mandatorily redeemable series b convertible preferred stock  in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal is due to proceeds from the issuance of mandatorily redeemable series b convertible preferred stock of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee plans of million  partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations of million 
the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal is due to payments on capital lease obligations of million partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee plans of million 
the company does not have any lines of credit 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents will satisfy our projected cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  we expect we will need to raise additional capital within the next months to fund future operating activities beyond the next months and are actively pursuing potential additional equity financing 
if we experience a material shortfall versus our plan for fiscal  we expect to take all appropriate actions to ensure the continuing operation of our business and to mitigate any negative impact on our cash position 
we believe we can take actions to achieve further reductions in our operating expenses  if necessary 
we also believe that we can take actions to generate cash by selling or licensing intellectual property  seeking funding from strategic partners  and seeking further equity or debt financing from financial sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
beyond fiscal  the adequacy of our resources will depend largely on our ability to complete additional financing and our success in re establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows 
our lease for our headquarters in santa clara  california expires in april we lease offices in israel and india under operating leases that expire in september for israel and in december for india

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  the company will evaluate the impact of eitf once the final guidance is issued 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which amends opinion by eliminating the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and implementation is done prospectively 
management does not expect the implementation of this new standard to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued and made effective two staff positions fsp that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effect of the american jobs creation act of  which was signed into law on october  in fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  the fasb concluded that the special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing  created by the new legislation  should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
as such  the special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing is recognized no earlier than the year in which the deduction is taken on the tax return 
fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  allows additional time to evaluate the effects of the new legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
the company does not anticipate that this legislation will impact its results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb decided to move forward with the issuance of a final fsp fas r  classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
the guidance in this fsp fas r amends paragraphs and a of fasb statement no 
r to incorporate the concept articulated in footnote of fas r 
that is  a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employee s control does not meet the condition in paragraphs and a until it becomes probable that the event will occur 
originally under fas r  a provision in a share based payment plan that 
table of contents required an entity to settle outstanding options in cash upon the occurrence of any contingent event required classification and accounting for the share based payment as a liability 
this caused an issue under certain awards that require or permit  at the holder s election  cash settlement of the option or similar instrument upon a a change in control or other liquidity event of the entity or b death or disability of the holder 
with this new fsp  these types of cash settlement features will not require liability accounting so long as the feature can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employee s control such as an initial public offering until it becomes probable that event will occur 
the guidance in this fsp shall be applied upon initial adoption of statement r 
an entity that adopted statement r prior to the issuance of the fsp shall apply the guidance in the fsp in the first reporting period beginning after february early application of fsp fas r is permitted in periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company does not anticipate that this new fsp will have any material impact upon its financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments 
this standard amends the guidance in fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
statement allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
management is currently evaluating the impact fasb will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issued eitf  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
eitf is effective for new instruments entered into and instruments modified in reporting periods beginning after june  we do not expect there to be a material impact from the adoption of eitf on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
impact of currency exchange rates in fiscal  all of our payments made to our suppliers and all of our payments received from our customers were denominated in us dollars 
we have in the past and may in the future enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to firm purchase commitments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating an instrument as a hedge include its effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
notwithstanding the measures we have adopted  due to the unpredictability and volatility of currency exchange rates and currency controls  we cannot assure you that we will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency fluctuations in the past  we purchased wafers in japanese yen and used foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to these purchases 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we did not have any foreign currency forward contracts in fiscal  and interest rate risk and investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit rating standards as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy also specifies limits on the type  concentration and maturity period of our investments 
our investment policy requires that we only invest in us dollar denominated investments 
in addition  a small portion of our cash balance is held in israel and india currencies 
foreign currency risk is immaterial due to the small amount of foreign currency holdings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
the table below summarizes our investment portfolio 
the table includes cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and related average interest rates

we did not have any non taxable investments as of january  and january  our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
at january   our cash and cash equivalents earned interest at an average rate of 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  operating results or cash flows are vulnerable to sudden changes in market interest rates 
assuming a decline of in the market interest rates at january   with consistent cash balances  interest income would be adversely affected by approximately  per quarter
