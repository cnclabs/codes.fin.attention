item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion set forth below supplements the information found in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of comforce corporation comforce and its wholly owned subsidiaries  including comforce operating  inc coi collectively  the company 
overview and recent developments staffing personnel placed by the company are employees of the company 
the company is responsible for employment related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  k  disability and life insurance to its eligible billable employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees for their services before receiving payment from their customers  often resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company grows  these receivables will increase and there will be greater need for borrowing availability under a credit facility to fund current operations 
we do not believe that we will be able to further extend the maturity of the pnc credit facility unless we identify a source of funds to repay or refinance our senior notes at their maturity on december  management has been examining alternatives to refinance or extend the maturity of the senior notes and  in anticipation that it will be successful  has initiated discussions to refinance the pnc credit facility 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  below 
the company reports its results through three operating segments human capital management services  staff augmentation and financial outsourcing services 
the human capital management services segment primarily provides staffing management services that enable fortune companies and other larger employers to consolidate  automate and manage staffing  compliance and oversight processes for their contingent workforces 
the staff augmentation segment provides healthcare support  technical and engineering  information technology it  telecommunications and other staffing needs 
the financial outsourcing services segment provides funding and back office support services to independent consulting and staffing companies 
management of the company has observed improvement in the business environment for staffing companies beginning in the first quarter of recent industry statistics have generally supported management s observations including  since the beginning of  improvement in the rate of job creation in the united states  however management is unsure how long these trends will continue in the future 

table of contents as previously reported in its periodic reports  one of the company s significant staff augmentation customers with revenues from the contract with this customer representing approximately of consolidated revenues for fiscal and approximately of revenues for the fiscal was evaluating whether the use of contingent labor is consistent with its business model 
this customer subsequently advised the company that it would significantly reduce its utilization of contract labor  including the company s employees  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through the end of the first quarter however  the proposed reductions were not fully implemented as of the end of fiscal and the client has indicated that its review of contract labor utilization is now complete 
the client has indicated its intent to conduct a formal request for proposal process for this business sometime during the company intends to participate in this process 
in addition  in accordance with the terms of the contract  this customer is auditing the invoices made under the contract with the company for the years to management does not believe any adjustment to the company s fees under this contract is warranted 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
this allowance is calculated on the trade receivables with consideration for the company s historical write off experience  the current aging of receivables  general economic climate and the financial condition of customers 
after giving due consideration to these factors  the company establishes specific allowances for uncollectible accounts 
the allowance for the funding and service fee receivables is calculated with consideration for the ability of the company s clients to absorb chargebacks due to the uncollectibility of the funded receivables 
bad debt expense  which increases the allowance for doubtful accounts  is recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by customers  the inability of the company s funding services clients to absorb chargebacks and other difficulties collecting amounts billed 
on the other hand  an improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision 
accrued workers compensation liability the company records its estimate of the ultimate cost of  and liabilities for  workers compensation based on actuarial computations using the company s loss history as well as industry statistics 
furthermore  in determining its liabilities  the company includes amounts for estimated claims incurred but not reported 
the ultimate cost of workers compensation will depend on actual costs incurred to settle the claims and may differ from the liabilities recorded for those claims 
accruals for workers compensation claims are included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
a significant increase in claims or changes in laws may require the company to record additional expenses related to workers compensation 
on the other hand  significantly improved claim experience may result in lower annual expense levels 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and net 
table of contents operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which realization of the asset is not likely 
management s judgment is required in determining the realizability of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances recorded 
the net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified  or management s estimates of future taxable income change  such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated 
in addition  valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that management s estimate of future taxable income changes from the amounts currently estimated 
the company provides for income taxes on a quarterly basis based upon an estimated annual tax rate 
in determining this rate  management estimates taxable income for each of the jurisdictions where the company operates  as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each state and foreign country 
to the extent these estimates change during the year  or that actual results differ from these estimates  the estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year 
goodwill impairment the company is required to test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas as of the end of each fiscal year or earlier during each fiscal year as circumstances require 
the company tested goodwill for impairment as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal and wrote off million of which million has been allocated to discontinued operations of goodwill in the staff augmentation segment 
the company also performed its annual testing for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and and determined that no additional write offs were required to be taken 
in connection with these goodwill tests  the company engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in the determination of the fair values of its reporting units as defined by sfas 
in its determination of the fair values  the firm engaged by the company primarily utilized a discounted cash flow analysis as well as various other valuation approaches  including a recent values paid by investors and purchasers of companies in businesses similar to that of the company  b capitalization multiples of companies with investment characteristics resembling those of the reporting units  c the enterprise value of the company  and d asset and liability structure 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include i expected future revenue growth rates  operating unit profit margins  and working capital levels  ii a discount rate  and iii a terminal value multiple 
the revenue growth rates  working capital levels and operating unit profit margins are based on management s expectation of future results 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services as compared to cost of services of of net sales of services for the year ended december  the cost of services as a percentage of net sales for fiscal increased from fiscal principally as a result of increased competitive pricing  higher state unemployment rates prevalent throughout the country and higher growth in human capital management services which have a higher cost of services as a percentage of net sales of services

comforce  coi and various of their operating subsidiaries  as co borrowers and guarantors  entered into an million pnc credit facility with pnc  as a lender and administrative agent and other financial institutions participating as lenders to provide for a revolving line of credit with available borrowings based  generally  on of the company s accounts receivable aged days or less  subject to specified limitations and exceptions 
the company entered into the pnc credit facility in june and it has been subject to five amendments 
at december   the company had remaining availability  as defined in the agreement  of million 
on may   the pnc credit facility was amended to lower the interest rates calculated in reference to libor 
as amended  borrowings under the pnc credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a per annum rate equal to either the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the base commercial lending rate of pnc as announced from time to time  or libor plus a specified margin  determined as follows fixed charge coverage ratio margin greater than greater than to greater than to equal to or less than as defined in the pnc credit facility

the maturity date of the pnc credit facility is june  the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the pnc credit facility at december   except that management failed to provide pnc with an annual debt compliance certificate confirming the company s compliance with the terms of the pnc credit facility for and we believe we were in compliance with the debt requirements under the pnc credit facility for these years but failed to provide the certificate based upon a good faith belief that it was not required 
pnc subsequently waived our non compliance with this requirement 
during fiscal year ended december   the company s primary sources of funds were million of cash provided by operating activities 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during the year 
the reduction of cash primarily resulted from a million increase in accounts receivable  million of capital expenditures and the repurchase of million of senior notes which was primarily offset by an increase of million of cash from net borrowings under the pnc credit facility and an increase of million of accounts payable and accrued expenses related to payroll  related taxes and amounts due to other staffing suppliers 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from the increase in net sales of services and an increase in contingent staffing supplier billing activity 
at december   the company had outstanding million principal amount under the pnc credit facility bearing interest at a weighted average rate of per annum 
at such date  the company had remaining availability of million  as defined in the agreement  under the pnc credit facility 
at december   the company also had outstanding i million principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at per annum and ii million principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at per annum 
as described below in this financial condition  liquidity and capital resources discussion  the senior notes mature on december  substantially all of the consolidated net assets of the company are assets of coi and all of the net income that had been generated by the company was attributable to the operations of coi 
except for permitted distributions  these assets and any cumulated net income are restricted as to their use by comforce 
the indenture governing the senior notes imposes restrictions on coi making specified payments  which are referred to as restricted payments  including making distributions or paying dividends referred to as upstreaming funds to comforce 
under the indenture  coi is not permitted to make cash distributions to comforce other than to upstream million annually to pay public company expenses  and to upstream funds to the extent coi meets the restricted payments test under the indenture  the most significant component of which is based upon of net income generated by coi since january  on a cumulative basis  less prior distributions made in reliance on this provision 
in calculating net income for this purpose  under the terms of the indenture  the company must apply generally accepted accounting principles as in effect at the time the indenture was entered into in principally as a result of distributions made  and losses incurred by coi in prior years  coi can make no distributions to comforce based upon the cumulative net income provisions of the indenture until coi generates additional net income of approximately million 
however  comforce has approximately million available at december  from proceeds it has generated from the sale of stock  principally upon the exercise of options and warrants 
this million may be used by comforce to pay interest and principal on the convertible notes or for other business purposes 
the company has made significant progress in improving its capital structure through the elimination of long term debt through the purchase or exchange of senior notes  convertible notes and other instruments 
since june  the company has reduced its public debt from million to million 
as a result  comforce has reduced its annualized interest expense by borrowing at the lower rates available under the pnc credit facility to effectuate repurchases of long term debt and by exchanging preferred stock and lower interest rate convertible notes for public debt 

table of contents the company s series a  b and a preferred stock provide for dividends of per annum and  at december  there were cumulated  unpaid and undeclared dividends of million on the series a preferred stock   on the series b preferred stock and  on the series a preferred stock 
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the pnc credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet currently anticipated working capital requirements through the end of thereafter  if the company experiences further growth in its businesses  it expects to request an increase of the availability under the pnc credit facility or pursuing other financing alternatives 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the pnc credit facility at december  and expects to remain in compliance for the next months 
the pnc credit facility matures on june  and the senior notes mature on december  as of the date of this report  the company did not have sufficient capital to repay the senior notes when they mature 
the company does not believe that it will be able to further extend the maturity of the pnc credit facility unless it identifies a source of funds to repay or refinance the senior notes at their maturity on december  management has been examining alternatives to refinance or extend the maturity of the senior notes and  in anticipation that it will be successful  has initiated discussions to refinance the pnc credit facility 
unless the company identifies a source of capital to repay or refinance the senior notes  it will be unable to repay either the senior notes or the pnc credit facility at maturity  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations  including million principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and million principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the estimated fair value of these debt obligations at december  was million for the senior notes  and million for the convertible notes 
management of the company does not believe that a increase in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of these fixed rate obligations 
borrowings under the pnc credit facility aggregating million at december  are at variable interest rates and interest expense will be impacted by changes in interest rates generally prevailing in the united states and internationally 
assuming an immediate increase in the weighted average interest rate of the impact to the company in annualized interest expense would be approximately  the company has not entered into any swap agreements or other hedging transactions as a means of limiting exposure to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company provides its services in several countries  however  based upon the current level of investments in these countries  it does not believe that a change in foreign currency rates would have a material impact to its financial position
