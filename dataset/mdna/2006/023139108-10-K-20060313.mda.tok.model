item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ambac financial group  inc is a holding company whose subsidiaries provide financial guarantees and financial services to clients in both the public and private sectors around the world 
our diluted earnings per share was for  a increase compared with during  ambac recorded record revenues of billion  an increase as compared to return on average shareholders equity was 
ambac s principal operating subsidiary  ambac assurance corporation  a leading guarantor of public finance and structured finance obligations  has earned triple a ratings  the highest ratings available from moody s investors service  inc  standard poor s ratings services  fitch inc  and rating and investment information  inc ambac assurance provides financial guarantees for bond issues and other forms of debt financing 
financial guarantee insurance is a promise to pay scheduled interest and principal if the issuer fails to meet its obligations 
a bond guaranteed by ambac receives triple a ratings  typically resulting in lower financing costs for the issuer and generally makes the issue more marketable  both in the primary and secondary markets 
ambac reports its financial guarantee segment broken out into three principal markets public finance  structured finance and international finance 
public finance includes all us municipal issuance including general obligations  lease and tax backed obligations  health care  public utilities  transportation and higher education  as well as certain infrastructure privatization transactions  such as stadium financings  military housing and student housing 
structured finance covers us structured finance transactions  including mortgage backed securities and other consumer asset backed securities  commercial asset backed securities  collateralized debt obligations  investor owned utilities and asset backed commercial paper conduits 
international finance covers both infrastructure privatization transactions and the structured finance markets outside of the us pre tax income growth in the financial guarantee segment was the result of increased net premiums earned and other credit enhancement fee revenues  partially offset by increased losses and loss expenses due to hurricane katrina 
management believes that the financial guarantee business thrives on economic cycles 
for example  a strong economic environment with good or improving credit is beneficial to our financial guarantee portfolio 
however  such conditions  if in place for an extended period of time  will reduce credit spreads and result in lower pricing 
conversely  in a deteriorating credit environment  credit spreads widen and pricing for our product improves 
however  if the weakening environment is prolonged  the stresses on our portfolio could result in claims payments in excess of normal or historical expectations 
ambac s management believes that its business is well positioned to withstand  and in fact prosper  within normal economic and business cycles 
further  ambac s financial guarantee business today enjoys a strong competitive position in a variety of product segments on a global scale and is positioned for further geographic product expansion 
management believes that geographic product expansion will be driven  over the long term  by critical infrastructure needs worldwide and the expansion of global credit markets 
ambac s financial services segment provides financial and investment products including investment agreements  interest rate swaps  currency swaps  total return swaps and funding conduits  principally to clients of the financial guarantee business  which includes municipalities and other public entities  health care organizations  and asset backed and structured finance issuers 
ambac focuses on these businesses due to the complementary nature of the products to its financial guarantee product 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require management to make significant judgments and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management has identified the accounting for loss and loss expenses and the valuation of financial instruments as critical accounting estimates 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereon included elsewhere in this report 
management has discussed each of these critical accounting and estimates with the audit and risk assessment committee of the board of directors 
financial guarantee insurance losses and loss expenses 
the loss reserve for financial guarantee insurance discussed in this critical accounting estimates disclosure relates only to ambac s non derivative insurance business 
losses and loss expenses are based upon estimates of the ultimate aggregate losses inherent in the non derivative financial guarantee portfolio as of the reporting date 
the evaluation process for determining the level of reserves is subject to certain estimates and judgments 
the liability for losses and loss expenses consists of active credit and case basis credit reserves 
ambac establishes an active credit reserve to reflect probable and estimable losses due to credit deterioration on insured credits that have not yet defaulted or been reported as of the reporting date 
the active credit reserve is established through a process that begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the adversely classified credit portfolio 
estimates are computed on each adversely classified credit 
these estimates are based upon i ambac s internal system of credit ratings  which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating agencies  ii internally developed historical default information taking into consideration ratings and average life of an obligation  iii internally developed loss severities  and iv the net par outstanding on the adversely classified credit 
the loss severities and default information are based on rating agency information and are specific to each bond type and are established and approved by ambac s portfolio risk management committee 
the portfolio risk management committee is comprised of senior risk management professionals and other senior management of ambac 
for certain credit exposures that have deteriorated significantly  ambac will undertake additional monitoring and loss remediation efforts 
additional remediation can include various actions by ambac 
the most common actions include obtaining detailed appraisal information on collateral  more frequent meetings with the issuer s or servicer s management to review operations  financial condition and financial forecasts and more frequent analysis of the issuer s financial statements 
for these credits ambac would use relevant information obtained from its remediation efforts to adjust the estimate discussed above 
case basis credit reserves are established for losses on insured obligations that have already defaulted 
we believe our definition of case basis credit reserves differs from other financial guarantee industry participants 
our case reserves represent the present value of anticipated loss and loss expense payments expected over the estimated period of default 
loss and loss expenses consider defaulted debt service payments  estimated expenses associated with settling the claims and estimated recoveries under collateral and subrogation rights 
the primary estimates impacting the statistical loss calculation are probability of default and severity of loss 
the probability of default increases as a credit exposure deteriorates in quality 
political  economic or other unforeseen events could have an adverse impact on default probabilities 
however  despite such unforeseen events  our experience has shown  it is not reasonably likely that there would be a change in the probability of default estimates such that a material change in our loss reserve estimate would occur 
our experience has shown that credit deterioration and related changes in default probabilities are a gradual process that typically occurs over a long period of time 
historically  claim payments on financial guarantee contracts have been infrequent but subject to potential high severity 
severity represents the amount of loss that would be incurred on a defaulted obligation due to the difference in the amount of net par guaranteed and the value of the related collateral and other subrogation rights 
loss severity estimates are based upon available information such as rating agency recovery rates or surveillance data such as collateral appraisals 
however  severity data used are estimates that are subject to change with political  economic and other market conditions or as new information becomes available 
severity of loss is a primary assumption used to estimate losses and an increase or decrease of the severity would provide a range of reasonably possible future outcomes that would differ from our current loss estimate  which could be material 
ambac has exposure to various bond types 
our experience has shown that for the majority of bond types  the estimate of loss severity has remained consistent in that material changes to severity estimates have not occurred 
however  for certain bond types  factors or events could have a material impact on the estimate of loss severity 
based upon our historical experience  certain types of exposures are more likely to experience changes in loss severity estimates 
we believe  based on our experience  there are three bond types in particular where it is reasonably possible that a material change in loss severity estimates could occur 
these three bond types are aircraft lease securitizations known as enhanced equipment trust certificates eetc  health care institutions and mortgage backed and home equity securitizations 
the collateral for an eetc bond is commercial aircraft 
intense competition in the global airline industry continues and has been further impacted by lower cost start up regional carriers 
as a result  major airlines have been forced to reduce costs and scale back aircraft purchases 
additionally  high energy costs have negatively impacted operations and competition between the largest aircraft manufacturers has served to reduce overall aircraft pricing 
these events have adversely impacted the value of certain aircraft and accordingly impacted the loss severity estimates associated with certain eetc exposures 
we have observed that the health care industry is also particularly subject to changes in severity estimates 
collateral associated with health care credits is generally in the form of a hospital facility 
the value of that facility is primarily impacted by the essentiality of that facility to a particular community 
for example  hospital facilities that do not have significant competition in a community generally have more stable collateral values than facilities in communities with significant competition 
it is also reasonably possible that severity estimates could materially change in the mortgage backed and home equity securitization sector 
severity estimates in this sector are impacted by residential real estate values 
increases in mortgage interest rates  increased unemployment or personal bankruptcies could have an adverse impact on residential real estate values and mortgage backed and home equity loss severity estimates 
see losses and loss expenses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
the table below outlines the estimated impact on the december  consolidated loss reserve estimate both active credit and case basis reserve of reasonably possible changes in the loss severity assumptions 
these changes in the loss severity assumptions  while maintaining the current probability of default and adversely classified credit rating constant  represent management s estimate of reasonably possible changes in severity and are based upon our historical experience 
category dollars in millions current severity assumption reasonably possible severity assumption increase in reserve estimate eetc health care mortgage backed and home equity as a result of the widespread devastation caused by hurricane katrina  ambac recorded loss and loss expenses of million in ambac s exposure to losses as a result of the hurricane is derived primarily from its guarantees of municipal bonds in the greater new orleans area and the gulf front regions that were most severely impacted by the storm 
in determining our loss estimates  our analysis has considered the unprecedented nature of the disaster  including the displacement of the communities residents  and the unique aspects of each insured bond  such as the nature of the revenue source  the level of debt service reserves  if any  and other transaction protections 
the severity of loss on these credits will be impacted by the timing and extent of residents return to the affected areas 
throughout the history of ambac  there have not been any significant losses resulting from natural disasters 
as a result  management has adjusted our assumptions to reflect the unprecedented nature of the disaster 
future decreases  if any  to these assumptions will have a similar relative effect on our loss reserves and future increases  if any  to these assumptions  excluding those municipal finance credits fully reserved  will also have a similar relative effect on our loss reserves 
ambac s management believes that the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of claims  but the reserves  including the probability of default and loss severity assumptions are based on estimates and there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability for losses will not exceed such estimates 
valuation of financial instruments 
the fair market values of financial instruments held are determined by using independent market quotes when available and valuation models when market quotes are not available 
ambac s financial instruments categorized as assets are mainly comprised of investments in fixed income securities and derivative contracts 
investments in fixed income securities are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas requires that all debt instruments and certain equity instruments be classified in ambac s balance sheet according to their purpose and  depending on that classification  be carried at either cost or fair market value 
ambac classifies investments in fixed income securities as available for sale 
the fair values of fixed income investments are based primarily on quoted market prices received from a nationally recognized pricing service or dealer quotes 
for those fixed income investments where broker quotes were not available  fair values are based on internal valuation models 
key inputs to the internal valuation models include maturity date  coupon and generic yield curves for industry and credit rating characteristics that closely match those characteristics of the specific investment securities being valued 
the valuation results from these models could differ materially from amounts that would actually be realized in the market 
the percentage of the investment portfolio that is based upon internal valuation models was and at december  and  respectively 
ambac s exposure to derivative instruments is created through interest rate  currency  total return and credit default swaps 
these contracts are accounted for at fair value under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended sfas 
fair value is determined based upon market quotes from independent sources  when available 
when independent quotes are not available  fair value is determined using valuation models 
these valuation models require market driven inputs  including contractual terms  credit spreads on underlying referenced obligations  yield curves and tax exempt interest ratios 
the net fair value of derivative contracts was million at december  ambac uses both vendor developed and proprietary models  based on the complexity of transactions 
the selection of a model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
for derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as interest rate and currency swaps  we utilize vendor developed models 
for derivatives that trade in less liquid markets  such as credit derivatives on synthetic collateralized debt obligations and total return swaps  a proprietary model is used because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in the market 
these models and the related assumptions are continuously re evaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based on improvements in modeling techniques 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf  recognition of a trading profit at inception of a derivative transaction is prohibited unless fair value of that derivative is obtained from a quoted market price  supported by comparison to other observable market transactions  or based upon a valuation technique incorporating observable market data 
ambac defers trade date gains or losses on derivative transactions where the fair value is not determined based upon observable market transactions and market data 
management s judgment is applied in recording adjustments to fair value that take into account various factors  including but not limited to  credit risk  future administration costs  the bid offer spread and illiquidity due to lack of market depth

results of operations the following paragraphs describe the consolidated results of operations of ambac and its subsidiaries for  and and its financial condition as of december  and these results are presented for ambac s two reportable segments financial guarantee and financial services 
income from continuing operations 
ambac s income from continuing operations in was million or per diluted share  an increase of million  compared to million or per diluted share in ambac s income before income taxes was  million in  an increase of from income before income taxes of million in of the  million of income loss before income taxes in   million was from financial guarantee  million from financial services and million from corporate 
corporate consists primarily of ambac s interest expense on debentures outstanding 
that compares to income loss before income taxes in of million  million and million from financial guarantee  financial services and corporate  respectively 
financial guarantee income before income taxes increased as a result of i higher net premiums earned and other credit enhancement fees  ii higher net investment income excluding the impact from the consolidation of variable interest entities under fin and iii the impact of a mark to market loss on interest rate derivative contracts relating to ambac s medium term funding conduit in  partially offset by i a higher provision for losses and loss expenses  ii lower net realized investment gains and iii higher operating expenses 
financial services increase is primarily attributable to higher net interest earned from investment agreements and higher mark to market gains on non trading derivative contracts  partially offset by lower derivative products revenue 
included in the income from continuing operations in the financial guarantee segment  is the impact of cancellations of a reinsurance contract with radian asset assurance inc radian  which had been downgraded by the rating agencies in the net impact of this cancellation to the consolidated statements of operations in amounted to approximately million  million after tax 
included in the income from continuing operations in the financial guarantee segment  is the impact of cancellations of certain reinsurance contracts with two reinsurers  axa re finance sa and american re insurance company  both of which had been downgraded by the rating agencies in the net impact of these cancellations to the consolidated statements of operations in amounted to approximately million  million after tax 
ambac s income from continuing operations in increased million compared to million or per diluted share  in ambac s income before income taxes in was up from income before income taxes of million in this increase was attributable to growth in both the financial guarantee and financial services segments 
income loss before income taxes in consisted of million from financial guarantee  million from financial services and million from corporate 
net loss from discontinued operations 
in november  ambac announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the operations of cadre financial services  inc and ambac securities  inc  its investment advisory and cash management business 
the transaction closed during the first quarter of  with proceeds of million in cash and million in a note 
this business had been part of the financial services segment 
the net loss from discontinued operations was none  million and million for  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the loss was a purchase price adjustment due to lower than anticipated revenues 
the loss for included a goodwill write down of million 
financial guarantee ambac provides financial guarantees for debt obligations through its principal operating subsidiary ambac assurance corporation  as well as credit protection in the form of structured credit derivatives through ambac credit products llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ambac assurance 
ambac provides these services in three principal markets public finance  structured finance and international finance 
ambac guaranteed billion of gross par value bonds during  an increase of from billion in par value written during increased compared to billion written during the following table provides a breakdown of guaranteed net par outstanding by market sector at december  and dollars in billions december  december  public finance structured finance international finance total net par outstanding the decline in international net par outstanding resulted primarily from calls  terminations and paydowns of pooled debt and mortgage backed transactions 
billion of the net par outstanding increase in was a result of the radian reinsurance cancellation noted above 
the following tables provide a rating distribution of guaranteed net par outstanding based upon internal ambac assurance credit ratings at december  and and a distribution by bond type of ambac assurance s below investment grade exposures at december  and below investment grade are defined as those exposures with a credit rating below bbb percentage of guaranteed portfolio december  december  aaa aa a bbb below investment grade total summary of below investment grade exposure bond type dollars in millions us public finance transportation health care general obligation tax backed university other total us public finance us structured finance enhanced equipment trust certificates investor owned utilities mortgage backed and home equity pooled debt obligations asset backed total us structured finance international finance transportation revenue investor owned utilities sovereign sub sovereign pooled debt obligations other total international finance grand total internal ambac assurance credit ratings are provided solely to indicate the underlying credit quality of guaranteed obligations based on the view of ambac and may differ from ratings determined by the independent ratings agencies 
the ratings are subject to revision at any time and do not constitute investment advice 
the total number of credits with ambac assurance ratings below investment grade were and at december  and  respectively 
increases within the us transportation and eetc bond types from december  are a result of the deteriorating credit quality within the airline industry 
also  us public finance below investment grade exposure in includes million related to hurricane katrina primarily general obligation bonds 
the decline in us mortgage backed and home equity below investment grade exposures relates to the prepayments of the underlying insured credits 
the decline in international finance pooled debt obligations resulted from a maturity of one transaction with net par of million 
public finance public finance obligations are bonds issued by states  municipalities and other governmental or not for profit entities located in the united states public finance 
bond proceeds are used to finance or refinance a broad spectrum of public purpose initiatives  including education  utility  transportation  health care and other general purpose projects 
although ambac assurance guarantees the full range of public finance obligations  ambac assurance concentrates on those projects that require more structuring skills 
certain projects  which had been financed by the local or us government alone  are now being financed through public private partnerships 
in these transactions  debt service on the bonds  rather than being paid solely by tax revenues or other governmental funds  is being paid from a variety of revenue sources  including revenues derived from the project itself 
examples of such transactions include stadium financings  student housing and military housing 
included in transportation obligations is exposure to us airports of billion at december  airport obligations are generally supported by i terminal lease revenues  parking and other concession revenues  ii passenger facility charges  or iii payments in respect of specific airport facilities 
public finance bond obligations par value written was billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
ambac s market share for  based upon par insured  remained relatively flat at compared to and up nearly over at approximately 
insured market penetration was in  the highest in the past years  up from and in and  respectively

new business guaranteed by bond type bond type us public finance lease and tax backed revenue general obligation health care revenue utility revenue transportation revenue higher education housing revenue other total us public finance structured finance structured finance obligations include securitizations of a variety of asset types such as mortgages  home equity loans  student loans and credit card receivables  commercial asset backed securities  leases  pooled debt obligations  investor owned utilities and asset backed commercial paper conduits originated in the united states structured finance 
included within the commercial asset backed sector are securitizations of operating assets  including aircraft  rental car fleets  and rail cars  as well as film and publishing royalties 
exposures to enhanced equipment trust certificates were billion at december  enhanced equipment trust certificates are secured financings used by the airline industry to finance aircraft 
the financings are tranched to create a priority of interests in the aircraft collateral 
pooled debt obligations  including structured credit derivative transactions  involve the securitization of a diverse portfolio of corporate bonds and loan obligations and asset backed securities the securitized assets 
ambac assurance s exposure to these securitized assets is mitigated through first loss protection 
typically  first loss protection is in the form of over collateralization ie  the principal amount of the securitized assets exceeds the principal amount of the structured finance obligations guaranteed by ambac assurance or excess spread ie  interest cash flows on the securitized assets is in excess of the interest on the debt obligations guaranteed by ambac assurance  which allows the transaction to experience defaults among the securitized assets before a default is experienced on the structured finance obligations 
structured finance obligations par value written was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase in structured finance obligations guaranteed for as compared to resulted primarily from higher par written in pooled debt obligations  partially offset by a decline in the consumer asset backed sector of the market including mortgage backed securities 
the increase in structured finance obligations guaranteed in compared to resulted from higher par written in the consumer asset backed sector of the market including mortgage backed securities  partially offset by a decline in pooled debt obligations and commercial asset backed transactions

international finance asset backed obligations may include significant components of domestic exposures 
ambac assurance s emphasis internationally has been on western europe and australia 
in the united kingdom  ambac assurance has participated extensively in the private finance initiative whereby the government has been privatizing certain infrastructure finance activities 
ambac assurance expects demand for our financial guarantees on infrastructure privatization transactions to increase in certain other european countries 
ambac also participates in less developed markets through certain structures such as pooled debt obligations and future flow transactions 
future flow transactions essentially securitize us dollar based future revenue streams arising from exports or banking flows 
international finance bond obligations par value written was billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
international finance obligations guaranteed during is lower than primarily due to decreases in mortgage backed obligations  pooled debt obligations although higher as a percentage of total new business generated  transportation revenue obligations  asset backed and conduits and sovereign sub sovereign obligations guaranteed  which were partially offset by higher investor owned and public utility obligations 
the decrease in international finance bond obligations guaranteed in compared to is primarily due to decreases in pooled debt obligations and transportation revenue obligations  which were partially offset by higher mortgage backed and sovereign sub sovereign obligations guaranteed

ambac assurance receives insurance premiums either upfront at policy issuance or on an installment basis over the life of the transaction 
the collection method is determined at the time of policy issuance 
gross premiums written in were  million  an increase of from  million in up front premiums written in were million  flat compared to million in up front premiums written by market sector saw increases in public finance  which were offset by decreases in both structured and international finance 
installment premiums written in were million  an increase of from million in the growth in installment premiums is due to the growing book of business in both structured and international finance 
gross premiums written in decreased from  million in this is a result of decreased business activity in all three market sectors 
the following table sets forth the amounts of gross premiums written by type public finance up front installment total public finance structured finance up front installment total structured finance international finance up front installment total international finance total total up front total installment total reinsurance 
ambac assurance s reinsurance program is principally comprised of a surplus share treaty and facultative reinsurance 
the surplus share treaty requires ambac assurance to cede covered transactions while retaining flexibility to cede those transactions within a predefined range 
certain types of transactions are excluded from the surplus share treaty and management may use facultative reinsurance to cede such risks 
ceded premiums written in were million  up from million in during  ambac completed a cancellation of a reinsurance contract with radian 
included in ceded premiums written in is million in return premiums from the cancellation 
in  ambac completed the cancellation of certain reinsurance contracts with two reinsurers  axa re finance sa and american re insurance company 
included in ceded premiums written in is million in return premiums from the cancellations 
excluding the return premiums from both and  ceded premiums were million for compared to million in  an increase of 
ceded premiums exclusive of the return premiums as a percentage of gross premiums written were and for and  respectively 
the mix of business underwritten and greater treaty participation drove the increase 
ceded premiums written in were down from million in  which represented ceded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums written of 
this decrease is due to the return premiums from the cancellation of reinsurance contracts in mentioned above 
the reinsurance of risk does not relieve ambac assurance of its original liability to its policyholders 
in the event that any of ambac assurance s reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts  ambac would nonetheless be liable to its policyholders in the full amount of its policy 
to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurers  ambac assurance i monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers  ii is entitled to receive collateral from its reinsurance counterparty in certain reinsurance contracts  and iii has certain cancellation rights that can be exercised by ambac assurance in the event of a rating downgrade of a reinsurer 
ambac assurance held letters of credit and collateral amounting to approximately million from its reinsurers as of december  the rating agencies continually review reinsurers providing coverage to the financial guarantee industry 
the following table provides ceded par outstanding by financial strength rating of ambac s reinsurers  on a standard and poor s s p basis dollars in billions aaa aa a not rated total on january   ambac assurance cancelled its remaining contracts with axa not rated in the table above and american re rated a in the table above and recaptured billion of par outstanding 
the january recapture will include approximately million of written premium to be returned to ambac assurance  of which million will be deferred 
the difference  million  which will be recorded in earnings at the time of cancellation  results from the difference between the negotiated amount of return premiums and the associated unearned premium remaining on the underlying guarantees 
net premiums earned and other credit enhancement fees 
net premiums earned and other credit enhancement fees during were million  an increase of from million in this increase was primarily the result of the higher refundings or calls of previously insured obligations and other accelerations  such as reinsurance cancellations  collectively referred to as accelerated earnings and the larger financial guarantee book of business 
when an issue insured by ambac assurance has been refunded or called  any remaining unearned premium net of refunding credits  if any is earned at that time 
the level of refundings or calls vary  depending upon a number of conditions  primarily the relationship between current interest rates and interest rates on outstanding debt 
the current relatively low long term interest rate environment continues to prompt the high levels of refundings 
as long term interest rates rise in the future  refundings should decline 
earnings on refundings relate to transactions where the premium was paid up front at the inception of the policy 
accelerated earnings also include the difference between negotiated return premiums and the associated unearned premium on reinsurance cancellations 
net premiums earned included accelerated earnings of million and million during and  respectively 
excluding the effect of accelerated earnings  normal net premiums earned which is defined as net premiums earned less accelerated earnings and reconciled to total net premiums earned in the table below in were million  an increase of from million in normal net premiums earned for the year ended december  increased  and for public  structured and international finance  respectively  from the year ended december  overall  the business environment has become more competitive 
increased competition from the uninsured market in the form of senior subordinated securitizations and other triple a rated financial guarantors has increased 
this increased competition has had an adverse impact on pricing 
the growth in normal earned premiums in structured finance and international finance that has been exhibited over the past several years has moderated as those lines of business have grown significantly  resulting in more difficult comparisons 
the mortgage backed securities and pooled debt obligation exposures have relatively short average lives 
as a result  the earnings from those types of exposures are recognized quickly 
a significant portion of the recent premium writings in public finance and for certain bond types within structured finance and international are for longer term transactions 
while the earned premium impact from such writings is not as immediate as the mortgage backed or pooled debt obligations  they increase the stability of earned premiums over time 
similarly  due to a tight credit spread environment in international finance  our exposures relating to pooled debt obligations have decreased significantly  adversely impacting earned premiums and other credit enhancement fees 
this  combined with the continued high level of run off in the mortgage backed securities book  adversely impacted overall earned premium growth 
competitive and credit trends such as the ones we are currently experiencing in domestic mortgage backed securities and international pooled debt obligations are a normal part of ambac assurance s business 
other credit enhancement fees in  which is primarily comprised of fees received from the structured credit derivatives product  were million  an increase of from million in credit spreads in the current environment have narrowed and this has had an adverse impact on new credit derivative business in when credit spreads are narrow  the pricing for guaranteed products is reduced 
net premiums earned and other credit enhancement fees during increased from million in this increase was primarily the result of increased normal net premiums earned from the larger financial guarantee book of business  partially offset by lower accelerated earnings 
net premiums earned in included million from accelerated earnings 
excluding the effect of accelerated earnings  normal net premiums earned in increased from million in other credit enhancement fees increased from million in the following table provides a breakdown of net premiums earned by market sector and other credit enhancement fees dollars in millions public finance structured finance international finance total normal premiums earned accelerated earnings total net premiums earned other credit enhancement fees total net premiums earned and other credit enhancement fees net investment income 
net investment income in was million  an increase of from million in the increase was primarily attributable to i the growth of the investment portfolio resulting from the positive operating cash flows of the financial guarantee book of business  ii an increase of million over from the consolidation of variable interest entities under fin offset in the statement of operations by line item interest expense on variable interest notes which had an increase of million over  and iii a net positive adjustment of million for certain municipal securities within the investment portfolio that have been pre refunded 
a pre refunding shortens the maturity of a bond resulting in accelerated amortization of bond premium or discount 
these positive impacts in investment income were partially offset by i the repurchase of ambac stock totaling approximately million in and ii net loss payments of million in investments in tax exempt securities amounted to  and of the total fair value of the portfolio as of december   and  respectively 
the average pre tax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was as of december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
net investment income in increased from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the growth of the investment portfolio resulting from the growth in the financial guarantee book of business and capital contributions from ambac financial group  inc to ambac assurance totaling approximately million during the fourth quarter of  million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a lower reinvestment rate due to the interest rate environment 
net realized investment gains 
net realized investment gains in were million  compared to net realized gains of million and million in and  respectively 
the following table details amounts included in net realized gains dollars in millions net losses gains on securities sold net foreign exchange gains on investments net realized gains net losses gains on securities sold are generated as a result of the ongoing management of the investment portfolio 
foreign exchange gains and losses primarily resulted from sales and maturities of long term foreign currency denominated securities in  and net mark to market gains on credit derivative contracts 
net mark to market gains on credit derivative contracts in were million  compared to net mark to market gains of million and million in and  respectively 
the change in estimated fair value of structured credit derivative contracts reflects net mark to market gains due to improvements in credit spreads on the underlying obligations 
there were no realized net losses paid on structured credit derivatives for the years ended december  and  and million for the year ended december  other income loss 
other income loss in was million  as compared to million in included in other income are deal structuring fees  commitment fees and income from ambac s qualifying special purpose entities qspes 
included in is a million mark to market loss on interest rate derivative contracts relating to ambac s medium term funding conduit 
also included within other income loss are structuring fees of million and million for and  respectively 
structuring fees are negotiated for certain domestic and international structured finance transactions  typically are collected at close of the transactions  and are earned ratably over the life of the transactions 
ambac has approximately million and million of deferred structuring and commitment fees included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
other income decreased million in from million in  primarily due to the mark to market loss on interest rate derivative contracts mentioned above 
losses and loss expenses 
losses and loss expenses are based upon estimates of the aggregate losses inherent in the non derivative financial guarantee portfolio as of the reporting date 
losses and loss expenses in were million  versus million in and million in the following table summarizes the changes in the total net loss reserves for and dollars in millions december  december  beginning balance of net loss reserves provision for losses and loss expenses losses paid recoveries of losses paid from reinsurers other recoveries  net of reinsurance ending balance of net loss reserves the loss and loss expenses were primarily driven by a provision for losses of million for municipal exposures impacted by hurricane katrina and losses of million from three credits that experienced credit deterioration  partially offset by favorable development in other aspects of our adversely classified credit listing 
ambac s exposure to losses as a result of the hurricane is derived primarily from its guarantees of municipal bonds in the greater new orleans area and the gulf front regions that were most severely impacted by the storm 
ambac has added individual obligations to the adversely classified credit list with total net par outstanding of approximately billion 
to date  ambac has paid three claims on obligations in the region  totaling approximately million and has subsequently recovered the full amounts 
in determining our loss estimate  our analysis has considered the unprecedented nature of the disaster  including the displacement of the communities residents  and the unique aspects of each insured bond  such as the nature of the revenue source  the level of debt service reserves  if any  and other transaction protections 
ambac s estimate of losses related to the hurricane was made without regard to any potential federal  state or local government assistance to individual municipalities or institutions 
the credit loss estimation process involves the exercise of considerable judgment 
due to the nature of the loss reserve estimate  ambac s ultimate loss associated with the hurricane may be materially different than the current estimate and thereby may affect future operating results 
ambac will continue to assess the impact of hurricane katrina on subsequent periods as more information becomes available 
the table below is information regarding our public finance classified exposures against which ambac has established its estimated reserve at december  ambac s public finance classified exposure by asset class net par as of december  dollars in millions bond type greater new orleans other louisiana mississippi other total general obligation leases and tax backed transportation university utility grand total a domestic health care institution  which defaulted in a prior year  continued to experience significant financial stress in ambac believes the primary factor causing the loss on this exposure is the competitive local environment for health care delivery and the resulting impact on revenue generation 
during  a public finance transportation issue defaulted due to a shortfall in the lease payments backing the insured obligation 
ambac is closely surveilling both of these credits and is in frequent communication with issuer management 
an enhanced equipment trust that was impacted by a bankruptcy of a commercial airline in  experienced additional losses in upon the settlement of the trust structure 
in connection with the settlement of the trust  ambac purchased three airplanes

active credit reserves were million and million at december  and included in the calculation of active credit reserves at december  and was the consideration of million and million  respectively  of reinsurance which would be due to ambac from the reinsurers  upon default of the insured obligations 
the active credit reserve at december  and was comprised of and credits with net par outstanding of  million and  million  respectively 
the decrease in net par outstanding of credits within the active credit reserve was driven primarily by credit improvements and exposure paydowns  offset by the addition of hurricane katrina credits 
case basis credit reserves at december  and were comprised of and credits  respectively  with net par outstanding of million and million  respectively 
decrease to the case basis credit reserves is primarily due to i the settlement of a claim relating to one eetc  and ii a decrease in case reserves for three mortgage backed securities transactions as a result of loss payments during and prepayments of the underlying insured par 
offsetting the decrease in case reserves were additions for healthcare and the public finance transportation issues noted and one general obligation bond impacted by hurricane katrina

financial services through its financial services subsidiaries  ambac provides financial and investment products including investment agreements  funding conduits  interest rate swaps  currency swaps and total return swaps  principally to clients of the financial guarantee business  which includes municipalities and other public entities  health care organizations  and asset backed and structured finance issuers 
the investment agreement business is managed with the goal of approximately matching the cash flows of the investment agreement liabilities with the cash flows of the related investment portfolio 
to achieve this goal in the investment agreement business  derivative contracts are used for hedging purposes 
the primary activities in the derivative products business are intermediation of interest rate and currency swap transactions and taking total return swap positions on certain fixed income obligations 
most of the swap intermediation is done on a fully hedged basis with the exception of certain municipal interest rate swaps that are not hedged for the basis difference between taxable and tax exempt interest rates 
as such  changes in the relationship between taxable and tax exempt interest rates will result in mark to market gains or losses 
revenues 
revenues in increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to i higher mark to market gains on non trading derivative contracts  ii higher interest from investment and payment agreement revenues  partially offset by lower derivative product revenues 
the increase in mark to market gains on non trading derivative contracts relate almost entirely to economic hedges of long term fixed rate investment agreement liabilities 
the non trading derivative contracts were highly effective economic hedges  but did not meet the technical requirements for hedge accounting under sfas statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these derivatives have been redesignated to meet the technical requirements of sfas no 
in it is expected that the mark to market of the derivatives and investment agreements will substantially offset each other in the income statement prospectively 
interest earned from investment and payment agreements were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily driven by higher floating rates in the investment portfolio 
derivative product revenues decreased in primarily due to lower new business revenues on interest rate swap contracts amounting to million and million in and  respectively 
the net mark to market gain on total return swap contracts for was primarily due to spread narrowing on certain credits within the total return swap portfolio 
revenues in increased from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to higher derivative products revenue of  due to increased swap activity and net positive mark to market adjustments in compared to net negative mark to market adjustments recorded in partially offsetting this was a decline in investment income of in the investment agreement business from million in the decline in investment income is primarily due to a decrease in the overall size of the investment portfolio related to the investment agreement business 
during realized losses included an impairment write down of million related to asset backed notes issued by national century financial enterprises  inc ncfe 
this loss was in addition to the loss reported in which amounted to million 
these notes  which were backed by health care receivables and rated triple a until october   have defaulted and ncfe filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in november the loss was specific to the ncfe notes and had no impact on other investments held 
in and  ambac has received cash recoveries of million and million  respectively  resulting from distributions under the ncfe bankruptcy plan  payments made by a trust created under the plan and litigation settlements 
ambac received additional ncfe related cash recoveries of approximately million during february also in february  ambac  and a group of certain other note holders  entered into a litigation settlement agreement

corporate expenses 
corporate expenses include the operating expenses of ambac financial group 
corporate expenses were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increased expenses in are primarily related to ambac s contingent capital facility of million 
prior period amounts were recorded directly in shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet rather than in corporate operating expenses 
the decrease in expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to a million write off of previously deferred debt issuance expenses in related to the issuance of million  debt  that was redeemed at par at the end of april  partially offset by costs in relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of provision for income taxes 
income taxes for continuing operations for were at an effective rate of  compared to and for and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate for compared to related predominantly to a increase in state income taxes due to mark to market adjustments in the financial services segment  and non deductible expense associated with the contingent capital facility

liquidity and capital resources ambac financial group  inc liquidity 
ambac s liquidity  both on a short term basis for the next twelve months and a long term basis beyond the next twelve months  is largely dependent upon i ambac assurance s ability to pay dividends or make other payments to ambac  ii external financings and iii investment income from its investment portfolio 
pursuant to wisconsin insurance laws  ambac assurance may pay dividends  provided that  after giving effect to the distribution  it would not violate certain statutory surplus  solvency and asset tests 
additionally  no quarterly dividend may exceed the dividend paid in the corresponding quarter of the preceding year by more than without regulatory approval 
based upon these tests  without regulatory approval  the maximum amount that will be available during for payment of dividends by ambac assurance is million 
ambac assurance paid dividends of million in ambac received regulatory approval for these amounts since it exceeded the statutorily prescribed thresholds 
ambac s principal uses of liquidity are for the payment of its operating expenses  income taxes  interest on its debt  dividends on its shares of common stock  purchases of its common stock in the open market and capital investments in its subsidiaries 
during  ambac issued million of debt and million of the proceeds were contributed to ambac assurance corporation in the form of securities and cash 
the remaining amounts may be used to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding million debentures due in  on or after its first call date in october the following table includes aggregated information about contractual obligations for ambac  excluding those of entities consolidated under the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

purchase obligations includes various technology related maintenance agreements  rating agency fees and other outside services 
amount represents expected contributions to the funded defined benefit pension plan and benefit payments on unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the next years 
contributions to the funded pension plan are equal to the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes  under current law 
amount represents expected claim payments on financial guarantee insurance contracts that have already defaulted 
expected claim payments on financial guarantee insurance contracts that have not yet defaulted are not included 
based on the amount of dividends that it expects to receive from ambac assurance and other subsidiaries during  and the income it expects to receive from its investment portfolio  management believes that ambac will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next twelve months  including the ability to pay dividends on its common stock in accordance with its dividend policy 
beyond the next twelve months  ambac assurance s ability to declare and pay dividends to ambac may be influenced by a variety of factors including adverse market changes  insurance regulatory changes and changes in general economic conditions 
consequently  although management believes that ambac will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet its debt service and other obligations over the long term  no guarantee can be given that ambac assurance will be able to dividend amounts sufficient to pay all of ambac s operating expenses  debt service obligations and dividends on its common stock 
a subsidiary of ambac financial group provides a million liquidity facility to a reinsurance company which acts as reinsurer with respect to a portfolio of life insurance policies 
the liquidity facility  which is guaranteed by ambac assurance  provides temporary funding in the event that the reinsurance company s capital is insufficient to make payments under the reinsurance agreement 
the reinsurance company is required to repay all amounts drawn under the liquidity facility 
no amounts have been drawn under this facility at december  ambac assurance liquidity 
the principal uses of ambac assurance s liquidity are the payment of operating expenses  claim payments  reinsurance premiums  taxes  dividends to ambac  and capital investments in its subsidiaries 
management believes that ambac assurance s operating liquidity needs can be funded exclusively from its operating cash flow 
the principal sources of ambac assurance s liquidity are gross premiums written  scheduled investment maturities  net investment income and receipts from structured credit derivatives 
financial services liquidity 
the principal uses of liquidity by financial services subsidiaries are payment of investment and payment agreement obligations pursuant to defined terms  net obligations under interest rate  total return and currency swaps  operating expenses and income taxes 
management believes that its financial services liquidity needs can be funded from its operating cash flow  the maturity of its invested assets and from time to time  by short term inter company loans from ambac assurance 
the principal sources of this segment s liquidity are proceeds from issuance of investment agreements  net investment income  maturities of securities from its investment portfolio which are invested with the objective of closely matching the cash flows of its obligations under the investment agreements and net receipts from interest rate  currency and total return swaps 
the investment objectives with respect to investment agreements are to achieve the highest after tax total return  subject to a minimum average quality rating of aa on invested assets  and to maintain cash flow matching of invested assets to funded liabilities to minimize interest rate and liquidity risk 
financial services subsidiaries maintain a portion of their assets in short term investments in order to meet unexpected liquidity needs 
investment agreements subject ambac to liquidity risk associated with unscheduled withdrawals of principal allowed by the terms of the investment agreements 
as of december   approximately billion  or  of the outstanding investment agreements at amortized cost relate to either fixed or contingent draw  floating rate investment agreements  which expose ambac to minimal liquidity risk 
contingent draw floating rate investment agreements are sourced in the structured finance markets and will only permit a draw in the event that well defined  observable events have occurred 
ambac considers these contingent draw events to be remote 
the remaining portfolio of investment agreements  approximating billion at december   consists of fixed rate investment agreements  primarily relating to debt service reserve and construction funds in support of municipal bond transactions 
debt service reserve fund investment agreements may be drawn unexpectedly upon a payment default by the municipal issuer 
ambac also considers these draw events to be remote 
construction fund investment agreements may be drawn faster or slower than anticipated when construction of the underlying municipal project does not proceed as expected 
credit ratings and collateral 
downgrades in ambac assurance s triple a financial strength rating would adversely affect ambac s ability to compete for business 
credit ratings are very important to the ability of financial institutions to compete in the financial guarantee  derivative  investment agreement and structured transaction market 
in the event that ambac assurance is downgraded  ambac may be required to post incremental collateral to its investment agreement and derivative counterparties  introducing liquidity risk 
in addition  most investment agreements provide certain remedies  including a termination of the investment agreement contract  for the investment agreement purchaser in the event of a downgrade of ambac assurance s credit rating  typically to a by moody s or a by s p 
in most cases ambac is permitted to post collateral or otherwise enhance its credit  prior to an actual draw on the investment agreement 
the financial services business executes a range of interest rate and cross currency swaps to reduce the market risk on investment agreements with ambac s derivatives subsidiary  ambac financial services  llc 
in addition  ambac financial services provides interest rate and currency swap transactions for states  municipalities  asset backed issuers and other entities in connection with their financings 
ambac financial services offsets most of the interest rate and currency risks in these instruments and incorporates these transactions under standardized derivative documents including collateral support agreements 
under these agreements  ambac could be required to post collateral to a swap dealer in the event unrealized losses exceeds a predetermined threshold amount 
ambac has posted collateral of million under these contracts at december  conversely  ambac could receive collateral from the counterparty in the event unrealized gains exceed a predetermined threshold 
ambac has received collateral of million under these contracts at december  the thresholds afforded ambac by the swap dealer would be reduced in the event of a downgrade of ambac s credit rating 
the reduction in the threshold could result in ambac posting additional amounts of collateral to the counterparty 
ambac capital services enters into total return swaps and ambac credit products enters into credit derivative contracts 
all of our total return swaps and a portion of our credit derivatives have collateral support agreements 
in addition  a downgrade of our financial strength rating below specified levels would allow credit derivative counterparties to terminate certain agreements  resulting in a possible payment of a settlement amount or we would have to pledge collateral for the benefit of the counterparty 
at december   ambac has not pledged collateral under any of its credit derivative or total return swap contracts 
ambac manages this liquidity risk through the maintenance of liquid collateral and bank liquidity facilities 
additionally  ambac generally has the right to re hypothecate collateral that it receives under derivative contracts to counterparties

if the put option were exercised  ambac assurance would receive up to million in return for the issuance of its own perpetual preferred stock  the proceeds of which may be used for any purpose  including the payment of claims 
the preferred stock would give investors the rights of an equity investor in ambac assurance 
such rights are subordinate to insurance claims  as well as to the general unsecured creditors of ambac assurance 
dividend payments on the preferred stock are cumulative only if ambac assurance pays dividends on its common stock 
each trust is restricted to holding high quality short term commercial paper investments to ensure that it can meet its obligations under the put option 
to fund these investments  each trust has issued its own auction market perpetual securities 
each trust is rated aa aa by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
during and  ambac assurance paid contingent capital facility fees of million and million  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management in the ordinary course of business  ambac manages a variety of risks  principally credit  market  liquidity  operational and legal 
these risks are identified  measured and monitored through a variety of control mechanisms  which are in place at different levels throughout the organization 
credit risk 
ambac is exposed to credit risk in various capacities including as an issuer of financial guarantees  as counterparty to reinsurers and derivative and other financial contracts and as a holder of investment securities 
ambac s portfolio risk management committee prmc employs various procedures and controls to monitor and manage credit risk 
the prmc is comprised of senior risk professionals and senior management of ambac 
its purview is enterprise wide and its focus is on risk limits and measurement  concentration and correlation of risk  and the attribution of economic and regulatory capital in a portfolio context 
all financial guarantees and structured credit derivatives issued are subject to a formal underwriting process 
various factors affecting the creditworthiness of the underlying obligation are evaluated during the underwriting process 
senior credit personnel approve all transactions prior to issuing a financial guarantee 
subsequent to issuance of a financial guarantee  ambac periodically performs reviews of exposures according to a schedule based on the risk profile of the guaranteed obligations 
proactive credit remediation can help secure rights and remedies which mitigate losses in the event of default 
ambac manages credit risk associated with its investment portfolio through adherence to specific investment guidelines 
these guidelines establish limits based upon single risk concentration and minimum credit rating standards 
additionally  senior credit personnel monitor the portfolio on a continuous basis 
credit risk relating to derivative positions other than structured credit derivatives primarily concern counterparty default 
the majority of these counterparties are clients of the financial guarantee business which have been subject to our formal underwriting process upon the issuance of a financial guarantee 
the counterparty credit worthiness of new clients is separately evaluated by senior credit personnel upon entering these contracts 
counterparty default exposure is mitigated through the use of industry standard collateral posting agreements 
for counterparties subject to such collateral posting agreements  collateral is posted when a derivative counterparty s credit exposure exceeds contractual limits 
please refer to note investments  located in part ii  item  for disclosures of collateral posted to ambac under derivative contracts 
market risk 
market risk represents the potential for losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market conditions 
the primary market risks that would impact the value of ambac s financial instruments are interest rate risk  basis risk eg  taxable interest rates relative to tax exempt interest rates  discussed below and credit spread risk 
below we discuss each of these risks and the specific types of financial instruments impacted 
senior managers in ambac s risk analysis and reporting group are responsible for monitoring risk limits and applying risk measurement methodologies 
the results of this effort are reported to the prmc 
the estimation of potential losses arising from adverse changes in market conditions is a key element in managing market risk 
ambac utilizes various systems  models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage market risk 
this process includes frequent analyses of both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve  value at risk var and changes in credit spreads 
these models include estimates  made by management  which utilize current and historical market information 
the valuation results from these models could differ materially from amounts that would actually be realized in the market 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates consist primarily of investment securities  loans  investment agreement liabilities  obligations under payment agreements  long term debt  and derivative contracts used for hedging purposes 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value based primarily on the valuation models discussed above on these financial instruments  assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  and dollars in millions change in interest rates estimated net fair value estimated change in net fair value basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline ambac  through its subsidiary ambac financial services  is a provider of interest rate swaps to states  municipalities and their authorities and other entities in connection with their financings 
ambac financial services manages its municipal interest rate swaps business with the goal of being market neutral to changes in overall interest rates  while seeking to profit from retaining some basis risk 
ambac s municipal interest rate swap portfolio may be adversely affected by changes in basis 
if actual or projected tax exempt interest rates change in relation to taxable interest rates  ambac will experience a mark to market gain or loss 
a portion of the municipal interest rate swaps transacted by ambac financial services contain provisions that are designed to protect ambac against certain forms of tax reform  thus mitigating its basis risk 
the estimation of potential losses arising from adverse changes in market relationships  known as var  is a key element in management s monitoring of basis risk for the municipal interest rate swap portfolio 
ambac has developed a var methodology to estimate potential losses using a one day time horizon and a confidence level 
this means that ambac would expect to incur losses greater than that predicted by var estimates only once in every trading days  or about times a year 
no loss during has exceeded ambac s var measure 
ambac s methodology estimates var using a day historical look back period 
this means that changes in market values are simulated using market inputs from the past days 
for the years ended december  and  ambac s var  for its interest rate swap portfolio averaged approximately million and million  respectively 
ambac s var ranged from a high of million to a low of million in and from a high of million to a low of million in ambac supplements its var methodology  which is a good risk management tool in normal markets  by performing rigorous stress testing to measure the potential for losses in abnormally volatile markets 
these stress tests include i parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve and ii immediate changes in normal basis relationships  such as those between taxable and tax exempt markets 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in credit spreads include ambac s outstanding structured credit derivative and total return contracts 
ambac  through its subsidiary ambac credit products  enters into structured credit derivative contracts 
these contracts require ambac credit products to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
if credit spreads of the underlying obligations change  the market value of the related structured credit derivative changes 
as such  ambac credit products could experience mark to market gains or losses 
market liquidity could also impact valuations 
changes in credit spreads are generally caused by changes in the market s perception of the credit quality of the underlying obligations 
ambac offers credit derivatives to provide credit protection enabling financial institutions to hedge portfolios of credit risk achieving either economic or regulatory relief 
ambac credit products structures its contracts with partial hedges from various financial institutions or with first loss protection 
such structuring mitigates ambac credit products risk of loss and reduces the price volatility of these financial instruments 
management models the potential impact of credit spread changes on the value of its contracts 
ambac  through its subsidiary ambac capital services  enters into total return swap contracts 
these contracts require ambac capital services to pay a specified spread in excess of libor in exchange for receiving the total return of an underlying fixed income obligation over a specified period of time 
if credit spreads of the underlying obligations change  the market value of the related total return swaps changes and ambac capital services could experience mark to market gains or losses 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair values based primarily on the valuation models discussed above on the net balance of ambac s net structured credit and total return swap derivative positions assuming immediate increases in credit spreads at december  and dollars in millions change in credit spreads estimated net fair value estimated unrealized gain loss basis point widening basis point widening basis point widening base scenario basis point narrowing basis point narrowing basis point narrowing basis point widening basis point widening basis point widening base scenario basis point narrowing basis point narrowing basis point narrowing the impact of changes in credit spreads will vary based upon the volume  tenor  interest rates  and other market conditions at the time these fair values are determined 
the increase in sensitivities to changes in credit spreads is primarily due to the average tenor of the portfolio 
liquidity risk 
liquidity risk relates to the possible inability to satisfy contractual obligations when due 
this risk is present in financial guarantee contracts  structured credit derivatives  investment agreements  interest rate swaps and futures contracts 
ambac assurance manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a comprehensive daily analysis of projected cash flows 
additionally  ambac assurance maintains a minimum level of cash and short term investments at all times 
ambac credit products manages the liquidity risk inherent in the structured credit derivative portfolio by holding cash and short term investments 
the investment agreement business manages liquidity risk by matching the maturity schedules of its invested assets  including hedges  with the maturity schedules of its investment agreement liabilities 
ambac financial services maintains cash and short term investments and closely matches the dates swap payments are made and received 
see additional discussion in liquidity and capital resources section 
operational risk 
operational risk relates to the potential for loss caused by a breakdown in information  communication and settlement systems 
ambac mitigates operational risk by maintaining systems and system backup and procedures to monitor transactions and positions  documentation and confirmation of transactions  and compliance with regulations 
legal risk 
legal risks attendant to ambac s businesses include uncertainty with respect to the enforceability of the obligations insured by ambac assurance and the security therefore  as well as uncertainty with respect to the enforceability of the obligations of ambac s counterparties  including contractual provisions intended to reduce exposure by providing for the offsetting or netting of mutual obligations 
ambac seeks to remove or minimize such uncertainties through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisers to analyze and understand the nature of legal risk  to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure
