item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the company s business consists of three segments bioproducts  biopharma and human health 
the bioproducts segment consists of research products and services and therapeutic applications 
the biopharma segment consists of the company s biopharmaceutical process development and manufacturing business 
the human health segment is primarily comprised of active pharmaceutical ingredients derived from organic chemistry and pharmaceutical intermediates 
during  cambrex achieved varying levels of success in its business segments 
the bioproducts segment attained an important breakthrough with its third consecutive year of or greater sales growth 
the number of biopharma development projects increased in but this achievement was overshadowed by the continuing challenge to restore profitability to the business and manage project timing 
in the human health segment  a record number of new development projects and higher volumes of branded apis and intermediates were offset by lower volumes and pricing for generic apis 
the following significant events occurred during which affected reported results a  goodwill impairment and a  charge to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets were recorded in operating expenses and a tax benefit of  related to the long lived asset impairment charge was recorded within the provision for income taxes 
the goodwill and asset impairments were recorded as the result of lower long term profitability projections for the biopharma segment and two small european reporting units in the human health segment 
a  valuation allowance recorded within the income tax provision to write down the carrying value of certain us tax assets that had previously been preserved by tax strategies 
the valuation allowance results from the company s recent history of domestic losses and its short term projections for continued domestic losses 
a  charge recorded within administrative expenses primarily due to the severance agreement with the company s former ceo 
a tax benefit of  due to a favorable swedish court decision 
an environmental charge of  for the expected cost of environmental remediation of a former site 
sales in increased to  including a unfavorable impact resulting from foreign currency  from  in due to higher sales in the bioproducts and human health segments partially offset by lower sales in the biopharma segment 
gross margins in decreased to from in due to lower bioproducts margins resulting from increased production labor to support current and future activity levels  lower biopharma margins caused by higher fixed plant costs and adverse product mix and lower human health margins due to unfavorable absorption and lower pricing 
foreign currency unfavorably impacted gross margin by percentage point in the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in the tax rate in was compared to in the tax rate variations result from valuation allowances recorded in on the tax benefit from pre tax losses in the us and ireland due to the company s recent history of losses in these jurisdictions 
the tax expense also includes a swedish tax benefit of  resulting from a favorable court decision and a benefit from the settlement of interest rate swaps previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income of  the company reported a net loss of  or per diluted share in  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  in dollars in thousands  except share data critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition revenues in the bioproducts and human health segments are generally recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
sales terms to certain customers include remittance of discounts if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs which are classified as allowances and rebates 
some contracts in the bioproducts and biopharma segments are based on time and materials and revenue for those are recognized as services are performed 
for contracts that contain milestone based payments the company utilizes the eitf revenue recognition of long term power sales contracts model for recording revenue 
under this method  revenue is based on the cost of efforts since contract commencement up to the reporting date  divided by the total estimated contractual cost from the contract commencement to the end of the development arrangement  multiplied by the total expected contractual payments under the arrangement 
however  revenue is limited to the amount of nonrefundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date 
in each of the segments the company has certain contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
these deliverables often include process development services and commercial production 
the company follows the guidance contained in eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue for each element is recognized when delivered to the customer based on the fair value of the element as determined based on sales price when sold separately 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities on the balance sheet 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments in accordance with fas  our review of long lived assets  principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles  requires us to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  the long lived assets are written down to fair value 
our review of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is done annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with fas utilizing a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model and compared to the carrying value 
if such analysis indicates that impairment may exist  we then estimate the fair value of the other assets and liabilities utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses to calculate an impairment charge 
dollars in thousands  except share data the determination of fair value for both fas and fas is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows primarily based on operating plans  discount rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
environmental and litigation contingencies the company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of our current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and our position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that the company will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
if probable and estimable  the company accrues for the costs of clean up  settlements and legal fees 
if the aggregate amount of the liability and the timing of the payment is fixed or reasonably determinable  the company discounts the amount to reflect the time value of money 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the company may have made with respect to their resolution 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits in the us  where profitability is uncertain and net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income or where future profitability is uncertain 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable 
the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is selected by projecting cash flows associated with plan obligations which were matched to a yield curve of high quality bonds 
the company then selected the single rate that produces the same present value as if each cash flow were discounted by the corresponding spot rate on the yield curve

the following table shows gross sales by geographic area for the years ended december  and north america   europe   asia   other   total   the bioproducts segment gross sales in of  were  or above bioproducts sales were unfavorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a stronger us dollar 
the increased sales  before the impact of foreign currency  are primarily due to higher sales in both the research products and therapeutics applications categories including cell biology  cell therapy  rapid microbial detection  testing services  serum  media and assays due to stronger demand  higher pricing and the addition of new customers 
bioproducts gross margins decreased to in from in due primarily to increased production labor to support current and future activity levels and higher utilities partially offset by higher sales volume and increased pricing in most product categories 
the biopharma segment gross sales in of  were  or below reflecting lower suite and process development revenues partially offset by higher reimbursed materials and labor fees 
foreign currency had no impact on biopharma sales 
biopharma gross margins decreased to in from in due primarily to a higher percentage of revenues from reimbursed materials which have virtually no profit margin  lower revenues and higher production costs 
the human health segment gross sales in of  increased  or above human health sales were unfavorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a stronger us dollar 
the increase in sales is due mainly to stronger demand of a gastrointestinal api  nicotine polacrilex resin used in smoking cessation products  a pharmaceutical intermediate used for end stage kidney treatment and higher sales of a diuretic api 
these sales were partially offset by lower sales of certain central nervous system and cardiovascular apis due to increasing competition resulting in lower volumes sold and lower sales of a gastrointestinal api and crop additive 
human health gross margins decreased to in from in due primarily to higher production costs  lower pricing on certain apis  and unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset by favorable product mix and increased sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  or of gross sales in increased from  or in sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel within the bioproducts segment 
higher administrative costs are primarily due to executive severance  increased personnel and higher environmental costs related to a former site  partially offset by lower valuation of stock appreciation rights and legal expenses 
dollars in thousands  except share data research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  compared to  or of gross sales in the increase primarily reflects investments in new product technologies for pathogen testing and higher custom development costs 
during the fourth quarter of the company performed an impairment assessment of long lived assets  which includes amortizable intangible assets as well as property  plant and equipment 
as a result of lower long term profitability projections  the company determined that the sum of the undiscounted expected future operating cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets 
the company recorded an impairment charge for long lived assets in the fourth quarter of  in the biopharma segment and  in the human health segment to write down these assets to their fair value as determined primarily based on appraisals 
during the performance of the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the goodwill of four reporting units was impaired utilizing the steps as outlined in critical accounting policies  asset valuation and review for potential impairment 
the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of was  in the biopharma segment and  in the human health segment 
the goodwill impairment charge is primarily due to lower long term profitability projections due to current market factors 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the biopharma segment 
operating loss in was  compared to in the results reflect lower gross margins in all segments and higher operating expenses 
in addition to the impairment charges  results include a charge for executive severance of  and a  charge for an environmental remediation reserve at a former site 
the results include the  charge for the goodwill impairment discussed above   of income due to early termination of a bioproducts customer contract and an unrelated  charge associated with the reorganization and related workforce reduction at a european facility 
net interest expense of  in decreased from average debt balance  year over year  was slightly lower in  while the average interest rate was in and the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in the tax expense for includes a  valuation allowance to write down the carrying value of certain us tax assets that had been previously preserved by tax strategies 
this valuation allowance results from the company s recent history of domestic losses and its short term projections for continued domestic losses 
since  the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits arising from domestic pre tax losses 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  on certain foreign and domestic net deferred tax assets as of december  the majority of the tax expense represents taxes on international profits 
the company will continue to record a full valuation allowance on its domestic net deferred tax assets and indefinite lived intangibles until an appropriate level of domestic profitability is sustained or tax strategies can be developed that would enable the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of the domestic net deferred assets would be realized 
if the company continues to report pre tax losses in the united states  income tax benefits associated with those losses will not be recognized and  therefore  those losses would not be reduced by such income tax benefits 
the carryforward periods for foreign tax credits  research and experimentation tax credits  net operating losses  and the federal alternative minimum tax credits are years  years  years and an indefinite period  respectively 
as such  improvements in domestic pre tax income in the future may result in these tax benefits ultimately being realized 
however  there is no assurance that such improvements will be achieved

gross sales were favorably impacted due to the exchange rates reflecting the weakness in the us dollar primarily versus the euro and swedish krona 
gross profit in was  compared to  in gross margin in decreased to from in  reflecting lower margins in the biopharma and human health segments partially offset by higher margins in the bioproducts segment 
the following table shows gross sales by geographic area for the years ended december  and north america   europe   asia   other   total   the bioproducts segment gross sales in of  were  or above bioproducts sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
the increased sales before the impact of foreign currency are primarily due to higher sales across most product categories including research products  endotoxin detection products  bioservices sales and process development products due to stronger demand  higher pricing  new products and customers and investments in sales and marketing 
these higher sales were partially offset by lower sales in biotherapeutic serum mainly due to timing of shipments and stronger sales in the bioproducts segment gross margins increased primarily due to higher sales volume  increased pricing in most product categories  lower bad debt reserves due to favorable collections and favorable impact of foreign currency partly offset by higher costs for raw materials 
the biopharma segment gross sales in of  were or below the sales decrease primarily reflects reduced billings in our biopharmaceutical manufacturing business driven by the completion or timing of projects and a change in contract terms from time and material to milestone payments 
this decrease was partially offset by higher reimbursable materials revenue due to timing of current projects 
foreign currency had no impact on biopharma sales 
the biopharma segment gross margins were down significantly compared to the prior year due to higher production costs  increased fixed costs associated with the addition of the liter fermentation suite a new suite which will increase the production capabilities in the facility and higher reimbursable materials revenue which has very low margins 
the human health segment gross sales in of  were  or above human health sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
excluding the currency impact  the increase in sales is due mainly to higher sales of custom development products  a pharmaceutical intermediate used for end stage kidney treatment  higher sales of cardiovascular  gastrointestinal and alzheimer treatment apis  and higher sales of amphetamines due to higher volumes 
these sales were partially offset by lower sales of central nervous system apis due to increasing competition resulting in lower volumes sold 
the human health segment gross margins decreased due to pricing pressures on apis and other fine custom chemicals  unfavorable impact of foreign currency and higher production costs partially offset by increased sales volume and favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  or as a percentage of gross sales in increased from  or in sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to additional dollars in thousands  except share data sales and marketing personnel in our human health and bioproducts segments and the impact of foreign currency exchange 
higher administrative costs are primarily due to the impact of currency translation due to the weaker us dollar  regulatory compliance costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act and higher information technology  legal and environmental costs  partially offset by lower medical claims  the vesting of stock appreciation rights in the fourth quarter and lower pension expense 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  compared to  or of gross sales in the increase primarily reflects investments in new product technologies for pathogen testing  higher custom development costs and the impact of foreign currency exchange partially offset by decreased spending for endotoxin detection technologies 
the results include the  charge for the goodwill impairment discussed above   of income due to early termination of a bioproducts customer contract and an unrelated  charge associated with the reorganization and related workforce reduction at a european facility 
the results include a charge of  discounted to the present value of the five year pay out related to an agreement reached with mylan laboratories under which cambrex will contribute  to the settlement of consolidated litigation brought by a class of direct purchasers 
in exchange  cambrex received from mylan a release and full indemnity against future costs or liabilities in related litigation brought by the purchasers  as well as potential future claims related to this matter 
the operating loss in was compared to income of  in the results reflect lower gross margins in the biopharma and human health segments partially offset by higher margins in the bioproducts segment  the  charge for the goodwill impairment discussed above and higher operating expenses 
the operating profit includes the  charge for the mylan settlement discussed above 
net interest expense of  in decreased from the net interest expense was reduced by interest income accrued on an income tax refund  while in interest expense also included a write off of deferred charges in associated with the day renewable senior revolving credit facility that was not renewed 
average debt balance  year over year  was virtually unchanged  while the average interest rate  net of the items discussed above  was in versus in the higher average rate in was due to the full year impact of million of privately placed long term debt  which carries a fixed rate that is currently higher than the company s revolving credit facility and the impact of slightly higher variable interest rates on the revolver 
the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in during  the company concluded that  of domestic deferred tax assets were deemed unlikely to be realized  and as such  valuation allowances for this amount were recorded against these assets 
since that time  the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on any domestic net deferred tax assets created since and as such no tax benefit has been recognized for domestic pre tax losses 
accordingly  for the year ended december  a valuation allowance of  was recorded against the company s domestic net deferred tax assets  including amounts related to the goodwill impairment charge 
the majority of the tax expense represents taxes on international profits 
the loss from continuing operations in was  or per diluted share versus income of  or per diluted share in the loss from continuing operations includes a goodwill impairment charge of  discussed above 
the income from continuing operations includes a charge of approximately  for the deferred tax valuation allowance and an  charge for the mylan settlement both discussed above

during  the company repatriated approximately  as a dividend from its foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  approximately  of which was from proceeds of a european based loan  and the balance from foreign subsidiary cash on hand 
the company used the repatriated cash primarily to pay down domestic debt 
cash flows used in financing activities in of  include a net reduction of debt of  and dividends paid of  partially offset by proceeds from stock options exercised of  in the company increased borrowings by  generated proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and paid dividends of  in october  the company entered into a  five year syndicated senior revolving credit facility year agreement  which expires in october the year agreement allows the company to choose among various interest rate options and to specify the portion of the borrowing to be covered by specific interest rates 
under the year agreement the interest rate options available to the company are the following i libor plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to  ii higher of us prime rate or federal funds rate plus 
or iii money market rate as quoted by the administrative agent of the agreement 
the applicable margin is based upon the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the year agreement  leverage rates 
the company also pays a facility fee between 
to 
on the entire credit facility which is based upon the leverage ratio 
the year agreement is subject to financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain levels of interest coverage ratio  leverage ratios and limitations on indebtedness 
the company complied with all covenants in this year agreement during the company is required to provide audited financial statements to its lenders under the year agreement within days after its fiscal year end 
the company has received a waiver from its lenders through june  relating to this requirement for the year ended december  the year agreement is collateralized by dividend and distribution rights associated with a pledge of a portion of stock that the company owns in a foreign holding company 
this foreign holding company owns a majority of the company s non us operating subsidiaries 
as of december   there was  outstanding and  undrawn under the year agreement 
of the undrawn amount   was available to be borrowed as of december  due to limits established in the year agreement 
as of december   the company had outstanding two senior notes  a  year note due in june with a rate of  and a  year note due in october with an annual rate of 
these senior notes ranked equal with the company s year agreement 
on january   the company elected to prepay these senior notes with funds provided by borrowing under the year agreement

see notes  and for additional information regarding our debt and other commitments 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
a key to our access to liquidity is the maintenance of our long term credit ratings and ability to meet debt covenants to maintain certain levels of an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio 
the company met all covenants related to the year agreement during any events that change the status of our ability to meet debt covenants or maintain our credit ratings could adversely impact our ability to fund operations 
our forecasted cash flow from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors including  but not limited to  declines in customer demand  increased competition  the deterioration in general economic and business conditions  as well as other factors 
see the risk factors section of this document for further explanation of factors that may negatively impact our cash flows 
any change in the current status of these factors could adversely impact the company s ability to fund operating cash flow requirements 
market risks in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy to lower its exposure to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro  swedish krona and british pound sterling 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the notional amount of these contracts as of december  was  unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts are undertaken to offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
dollars in thousands  except share data with respect to the contracts outstanding at december   a fluctuation of the local currency over a one year period would cause  pre tax earnings to be at risk 
this is based on the notional amount of the contracts  adjusted for unrealized gains and losses  of  these calculations do not include the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would offset the gains and losses of the derivative instruments 
interest rate management as of december   the company had  in fixed interest borrowings privately placed notes and the rest of its borrowings of  were based on short term variable interest rates in the new year agreement 
with the repayment of the privately placed notes in january  the company s entire bank debt is based on short term interest rates in the year agreement 
contingencies the company is subject to various investigations  claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
the company continually assesses all known facts and circumstances as they pertain to all legal and environmental matters and evaluates the need for reserves and disclosures as deemed necessary based on these facts and circumstances and as such facts and circumstances develop 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company and or its subsidiaries is a party to several environmental proceedings and remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
additionally  as discussed in the sale of rutherford chemicals section of this note  the company has retained the liability for certain environmental proceedings  associated with the rutherford chemicals business 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight or adjudication 
additionally  many remediation requirements are not fixed and are likely to be affected by future technological  site  and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate extent of liabilities with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty 
in matters where the company has been able to reasonably estimate its liability  the company has accrued for the estimated costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites not owned by the company and the company s current and former operating sites 
these accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the accrual is primarily due to estimated remediation costs at the clifton site see below based on information developed during the third quarter of of  offset by a decrease in a reserve at an international site of  currency fluctuation of and payments of based upon currently available information and analysis  the company s current accrual represents management s best estimate of what it believes are the probable and estimable costs associated with environmental proceedings including amounts for legal and investigation fees where remediation costs may not be estimable at the reporting date 
as a result of the sale of the bayonne  new jersey facility see sale of rutherford chemicals section of this note  an obligation to investigate site conditions and conduct required remediation under the new jersey industrial site recovery act was triggered and the company has retained the responsibility for such obligation 
the company completed a preliminary assessment of the site and submitted the preliminary assessment to the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep 
the preliminary assessment identified potential areas of concern based on historical operations and sampling of such areas dollars in thousands  except share data commenced 
the company has completed a second phase of sampling and determined that a third phase of sampling is necessary to determine the extent of contamination and any necessary remediation 
the results of the completed and proposed sampling  and any additional sampling deemed necessary  will be used to develop an estimate of the company s future liability for remediation costs  if required 
the company submitted its plan for the third phase of sampling to the njdep during the fourth quarter 
the sampling will commence in the next few months 
in march  the company completed the acquisition of the cambrex profarmaco landen facility in belgium 
at the time of acquisition  cambrex was aware of certain site contamination and recorded a reserve for the estimated costs of remediation 
this property has been the subject of an extensive on going environmental investigation 
the investigation has been completed and the company concluded that no change to the reserve was necessary based on the information developed through the investigation 
the health risk assessment related to the site contamination is on going  and is expected to be completed in the near future  and the results of such assessment may affect the reserves 
the company s cosan subsidiary conducted manufacturing operations in clifton  new jersey from until prior to the acquisition by the company  the operations were moved to another location and thereafter cambrex purchased the business 
in  cosan entered into an administrative consent order with the njdep 
under the administrative consent order  cosan is required to complete an investigation of the extent of the contamination related to the clifton site and conduct remediation as may be necessary 
during the third quarter  the company completed the investigation related to the clifton site  which extends to adjacent properties 
the results of the investigation caused the company to increase its related reserves by  the company submitted the results of the investigation and proposed remedial action plan to the njdep 
the increase in the reserves is based on the proposed remedial action plan 
in february  the new jersey federal district court ruled that a lawsuit claiming property damages against cosan by the owners of contaminated property adjacent to the clifton location could be placed on the active calendar 
discovery in this matter is ongoing 
the outcome of this matter could also affect the reserves 
in mid the usepa conducted a hazardous waste inspection of the company s charles city facility 
thereafter  the usepa notified the facility of several alleged violations of the hazardous waste laws related to management of hazardous waste and requested additional information related to the alleged violations 
the company responded and provided information which questioned the conclusion that the violations occurred 
nevertheless  the usepa concluded that several violations existed at the time of the inspection  and on october  issued the facility an order and penalty assessment in the amount of on october  the company filed a request for a hearing and an informal conference to discuss settlement 
settlement discussions have been on going as we prepare for the hearing 
in march  the company received notice from the united states environmental protection agency usepa that two former operating subsidiaries are considered potentially responsible parties prps at the berry s creek superfund site  bergen county  new jersey 
our operating companies are among many other prps that were listed in the notice 
pursuant to the notice the prps have been asked to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the berry s creek site 
the company has met with the other prps 
both operating companies joined the groups of prps and filed a joint response to the usepa agreeing to jointly negotiate to conduct or fund along with other prps an appropriate remedial investigation and feasibility study of the berry s creek site 
at this time it is too early to predict the extent of any liabilities  consequently we have not recorded any reserves for this matter 
the company is involved in other matters where the range of liability is not reasonably estimable at this time and it is not determinable when information will become available to provide a basis for recording an accrual  should an accrual be required 
if any of the company s environmental matters are resolved in a more unfavorable manner than presently estimated  these matters either individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period
