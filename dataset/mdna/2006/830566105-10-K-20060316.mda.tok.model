item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we design  market and sell contemporary footwear for men  women and children under the skechers brand as well as seven other unique brand names 
our footwear is sold through a wide range of department stores and leading specialty retail stores  mid tier retailers  boutiques  our own retail stores  distributor owned international retail stores and our e commerce website

our operations are organized along our distribution channels and have the following three reportable sales segments domestic wholesale sales  international wholesale sales and retail sales 
in addition  we report an all other segment  which includes our e commerce sales and other miscellaneous sales 
we evaluate segment performance based primarily on net sales and gross margins 
see detailed segment information in footnote to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii  item of this annual report 
financial overview our net sales for increased million  or percent  to billion from million in our strong performance in was the result of our dedicated efforts to consistently deliver trend right styles  which has led to an increased demand for our in season product and continued growth in our fashion and street lines 
our domestic wholesale segment is our largest distribution channel comprising   and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international wholesale sales comprised   and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
retail sales comprised   and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which our domestic retail sales comprised   and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international retail sales did not comprise more than of our consolidated net sales in  or domestic wholesale unit sales volume increased to million pairs in from million pairs in  and our average selling price per pair increased to in from in these increases in average selling price per pair and increase in unit sales volume were due to the continued improvement and favorable response to our in season product in we achieved diluted earnings per share of on net sales of billion in our higher net sales and profitability for as compared to are primarily attributable to stronger than anticipated sales of in line product  increased margins due to a shift in sales to our higher margin business units  increased international wholesale and retail sales  and a reduction in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales 
we had working capital of million at december   an increase of million from working capital of million at december  we generated an increase of million in cash during bringing our cash balance to million at year end compared to million at december  these positive results are being driven by focusing on our core strengths and initiatives which included new product design and delivery 
our success depends on our ability to frequently introduce new styles and product lines as well as design products in anticipation of consumers ever evolving preferences 
this includes building our existing product lines with updates to proven sellers as well as creating new styles that we believe will become core to the line in upcoming seasons 
our focus in was primarily on updating many key sellers in our current lines and growing our product offering for our recently launched fashion and street lines motoring  unltd 
by marc ecko and rhino red 
in addition  we also introduced two new product lines kitson for women and girls  and siren by mark nason for women 
we will continue to broaden our product offering with new lines that do not directly compete with our existing brands and allow us the opportunity to broaden the targeted demographic profile of our consumer base  increase our shelf space and enter into new doors without detracting from existing business 
recently  we announced a licensed line of footwear for zoo york  which is one of the leading action sport apparel brands  that we expect to introduce for the back to school selling season 
building our brands 
as a marketing driven company  we consistently focus on advertising the skechers brands in targeted publications  on key television programming and in high traffic areas and key malls 
during  we capitalized on our presence with 
table of contents celebrity endorsee driven ads first with the worldwide christina aguilera campaign that concluded in june  and then with the launch of our new skechers celebrity endorsee  rising star and american idol winner carrie underwood 
we believe ms 
underwood s appeal and popularity will have a positive impact on our brand and create further demand for our product as her debut album remains one of the top albums in the united states 
in addition  the launch of television sponsorship campaigns for our skechers men s  women s and children s lines will further grow our brand with our diverse consumer base 
our goal with our fashion and street lines is to increase brand recognition through the continued presence of print and television advertising in targeted markets 
depending on need  each brand has its own print campaign and some may have additional forms of marketing  such as television 
of the seven brands that comprise this division  unltd 
by marc ecko and rhino red are globally recognized brands  michelle k and mark nason are becoming more established through several years of marketing efforts  and motoring and kitson are brands with rapidly growing recognition 
with the appeal and uniqueness of the motoring brand  we were able to develop a signature line of sneakers with multi platinum hip hop recording artist the game  which has resulted in a complete marketing program featuring him 
in addition  we signed an endorsement deal with oscar nominated actor terrence howard to support our motoring brand 
we believe that these campaigns  including the game campaign  should generate additional demand for our fashion and street products in targeted approach to licensing 
we have signed select licensing deals in the united states and abroad to further grow and enhance the image of the skechers brand 
our most significant domestic license to date is with kids headquarters for skechers kids apparel  daywear and sleepwear  which launched for the back to school selling season in we have also signed licensing agreements for apparel and or accessories in japan  israel  china  philippines  and central and south america 
we believe these licenses will have a positive impact on our brand in these international markets 
further develop international businesses 
in  we continued to focus on improving our international operations by i increasing our customer base within our subsidiary business  ii increasing the product count within each account  iii delivering the right product into the right markets  specifically with our distributor business and iv tailoring our product offerings currently available to our international customers to increase demand for our product 
our international business is supported by eight subsidiaries that sell direct to wholesale accounts in countries in europe and in canada 
we believe the continued strength of our international business is a direct result of a broader acceptance of our trend right product and increases in style counts 
we believe most of our distributors have implemented appropriate product and marketing efforts  which positions them to improve their businesses in we expect countries where distributors have opened skechers retail stores to benefit the most from these efforts 
further grow our company owned retail business 
with a focus on profitably growing our retail business  in we increased our store count by eight stores  and we opened one additional store in utah in the first two months of  bringing our domestic and international store count to we have seen double digit comparable store sales growth in our domestic retail business during and believe that it will continue to grow as we expand into new domestic markets 
we plan to open another to stores in continued management of expenses 
we continue to focus on cost management and are dedicated to growing profitably 
in  our selling and general and administrative expenses declined slightly as a percentage of net sales

gross profit for our international wholesale segment increased million  or  to million for compared to million in gross margins were for compared to in the increase in gross margins was primarily due to increased margins in our distributor business 
the increase in distributor gross margins was primarily due to stronger sales of in line merchandise and better product sell throughs 
international wholesale sales through our foreign subsidiaries achieve higher gross margins than our international wholesale sales through our foreign distributors 
gross margins for our direct subsidiary sales were for both and our cost of sales includes the cost of footwear purchased from our manufacturers  royalties  duties  quota costs  inbound freight including ocean  air and freight from the dock to our distribution centers  broker fees and storage costs 
because we include expenses related to our distribution network in general and administrative expenses while some of our competitors may include expenses of this type in cost of sales  our gross margins may not be comparable  and we may report higher gross margins than some of our competitors in part for this reason

for production orders that were outstanding with firm delivery dates and that did not ship in time to meet our delivery requirements  the manufacturer paid the costs to overnight product to our distribution centers 
future electrical shortages may extend the time necessary to produce our orders  and there may be circumstances where we may have to incur premium freight charges to expedite product to our customers 
if we incur a significant amount of premium charges to airfreight product for our customers  our gross profit will be negatively affected if we are unable to collect those charges

critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates are affected by more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  promotional items  valuation allowances  inventory reserves  valuation of 
table of contents intangible and long lived assets  litigation reserves  valuations of deferred income taxes  cooperative arrangements and foreign currency translation 
revenue recognition 
we derive income from the sale of footwear and royalties earned from licensing the skechers brand 
the significant portion of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of footwear 
domestically  goods are shipped directly from our domestic distribution center in ontario  california  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center fob shipping point 
for our international wholesale accounts  product is shipped direct from our distribution center in liege  belgium  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center 
for our distributor sales  the goods are delivered directly from the independent factories to our distributors freight forwarders on a free named carrier fca basis  and revenue is recognized upon receipt of a freight cargo receipt 
our company recognizes revenue from retail sales at the point of sale 
royalty income is earned from our licensing arrangements 
upon signing a new licensing agreement  we receive up front fees  which are generally characterized as prepaid royalties 
these fees are initially deferred and recognized as revenue as earned ie  as licensed sales are reported to the company or on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
the first calculated royalty payment is based on actual sales of the licensed product 
typically  at each quarter end we receive correspondence from our licensees indicating what the actual sales for the period were 
this information is used to calculate and accrue the related royalties currently receivable based on the terms of the agreement 
allowance for bad debts  returns and customer chargebacks 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account  and it is adjusted accordingly 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions in the customers country or industry  historical losses and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
we also reserve for potential disputed amounts or chargebacks with our customers 
our chargeback reserve is based on a collectibility percentage based on factors such as historical trend  current economic conditions  and nature of the chargeback receivables 
we also reserve for potential sales returns and allowances based on historical trends 
the likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment 
reserves are fully provided for all probable losses of this nature 
for receivables that are not specifically identified as high risk  we provide a reserve based upon a percent of sales for the last two months 
this percentage is based on our historical loss rate 
gross trade accounts receivable balance was million and the allowance for bad debts  returns and customer chargebacks was million at december  inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow moving inventory 
our review is based on inventory on hand  prior sales and our expected net realizable value 
our analysis includes a review of inventory quantities on hand at period end in relation to year to date sales and projections for sales in the near future 
the net realizable value  or market value  is determined based on our estimate of sales prices of such inventory through off price or discount store channels 
a write down of inventory is considered permanent and creates a new cost basis for those units 
the likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent primarily on our expectation of future consumer demand for our product 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer demand for our product or of the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory valuation changes  either favorably or unfavorably  compared to the requirement determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
at december   our gross inventory value was million and our inventory reserve was million 
valuation of long lived assets 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the impairment of long lived assets that require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income  
table of contents any loss of legal ownership or title to the asset s  any significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
in addition  we prepare a summary of store contribution from our domestic retail stores to assess potential impairment of the fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
stores with negative contribution opened in excess of twenty four months are then reviewed in detail to determine if impairment exists 
at december  we recorded an impairment charge in general and administrative expenses for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of million 
litigation reserves 
estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would depend on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on a large portion of the remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as such  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of our deferred tax assets depends on future taxable income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies amongst the various domestic and international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we evaluate our projections of taxable income to determine the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million and a valuation allowance of million against losses not expected to be utilized by certain foreign subsidiaries 
cooperative arrangements 
we do not have a formal cooperative advertising program and any related activity is usually small 
any payments made or credits provided to our resellers are either charged against net sales  if the criteria of emerging issues task force issue no 
has not been met  or charged to the line item caption selling expense when certain criteria have been met 
amounts that are charged as an expense in the line item caption selling expense are typically supported by an invoice or other supporting documentation from our customers that provide verifiable support of their expenditures  which may include third party invoices for advertising related costs  ie photo and catalog costs 
foreign currency translation 
our international operations generally use their respective local currencies as their functional currency 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation sfas  revenues and expenses from our international subsidiaries are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect for the period in which such revenues and expenses occur 
international subsidiaries that use their local currency as their functional currency translate their assets and liabilities using current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gains and losses for such subsidiaries are included within accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
one international subsidiary has a functional currency of the us dollar 
resulting remeasurement gains and losses from this subsidiary are included in the determination of net earnings 
a substantial portion of our intercompany loans are considered long term investments and the gains or losses from currency fluctuations are included as a component of translation adjustment in other comprehensive income 
inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on our sales or profitability 
however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of inflation on future operating results 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our sales or profitability 
while we have been able to offset our foreign product cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make such increases or changes in the future 

table of contents exchange rates we receive us dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our royalty income 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future 
during and  exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our inventory costs 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
future accounting changes on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on april   the sec announced a deferral of the effective date of statement r for calendar year companies until the beginning of early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we have adopted statement r effective january  we adopted statement r using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted and modified after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the company estimates that the adoption of statement r will result in the recognition of compensation costs of approximately million in  excluding the cost associated with additional share based awards granted in  if any 
statement r also requires excess tax benefits as defined to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted the provisions of sfas on january  and such adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a change in accounting principle 
it applies both to voluntary changes and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement if the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by recording the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of sfas on january  and such adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease  collectively referred to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements 
eitf provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of a the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements useful lives  or b a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase 
eitf is effective on a prospective basis for 
table of contents subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we do not hold any derivative securities that require fair value presentation per fasb statement no 
market risk is the potential loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have and will have an impact on our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations 
at december   no amounts were outstanding that were subject to changes in interest rates  however  the interest rate charged on our line of credit facility is based on the prime rate of interest  and changes in the prime rate of interest will have an effect on the interest charged on outstanding balances 
no amounts are currently outstanding 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our non us dollar functional currency foreign subsidiary s revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates may affect the value of our inventory commitments 
also  inventory purchases of our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which could have the effect of increasing the cost of goods sold in the future 
we manage these risks by primarily denominating these purchases and commitments in us dollars 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risks
