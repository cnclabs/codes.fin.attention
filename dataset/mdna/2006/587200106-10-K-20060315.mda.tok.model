in addition  international operations subject us to other risks including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings and difficulties with licensing and protecting our intellectual property rights 
the delay in production of components or the ordering of excess components for our emulation hardware products could materially adversely impact us 
the success of our emulation product depends on our ability to procure hardware components on a timely basis from a limited number of suppliers  assemble and ship systems on a timely basis with appropriate quality control  develop distribution and shipment processes  manage inventory and related obsolescence issues and develop processes to deliver customer support for hardware 
our inability to be successful in any of the foregoing could materially adversely impact us 
we commit to purchase component parts from suppliers based on sales forecasts of our emulation products 
if we cannot change or be released from these non cancelable purchase commitments  and if orders for our products do not materialize  we could incur significant costs related to the purchase of excess components which could become obsolete before we can use them 
additionally  a delay in production of the components could materially adversely impact our operating results 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights or to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses could materially adversely impact us 
our success depends  in large part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent these protections 
the companies in the eda industry  as well as entities and persons outside the 
table of contents industry  are obtaining patents at a rapid rate 
many of these entities have substantially larger patent portfolios than we have 
as a result  we may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect our rights or defend our customers rights 
we may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable  such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties  or force us to stop selling or redesign one or more products 
we cannot assure that the rights granted under our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage  that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as united states law protects these rights in the united states 
some of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
our failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights on favorable terms could materially adversely impact us 
future litigation may materially adversely impact us 
any future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales and substantial unanticipated legal costs and divert the efforts of management personnel  any and all of which could materially adversely impact us 
we may become subject to unfair hiring claims  which could prevent us from hiring needed employees  incur liability for damages or incur substantial unanticipated legal costs 
companies whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of confidential information or trade secrets 
these claims could prevent us from hiring needed employees 
they may result in us incurring liability for damages and or substantial unanticipated legal costs 
these claims also may divert the efforts of management personnel from our operations 
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications 
due to the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design  or the products or systems incorporating our designs and intellectual property may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of current customers and loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problems resulting from errors or defects  and increased service costs 
our failure to attract and retain key employees may harm us 
we depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  our research and development staff and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical and services personnel 
competition for experienced  high quality personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
the failure by us to hire and retain such personnel would impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively 
regulations adopted by the nasdaq stock market require stockholder approval for new stock option plans and significant amendments to existing plans  including increasing the number of options available for grant 
these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future 
to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract and retain employees  which could materially adversely impact us 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely impact the markets on which our securities trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and investment in our business 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel more difficult and expensive and ultimately affect our revenues 
any armed conflict entered into by the united states could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result from an armed conflict and could negatively impact our business 
we currently have operations in pakistan  egypt and israel  countries that may be particularly susceptible to this risk 
the consequences of any armed conflict are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse impact on us 

table of contents more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in volatility of the market price for our common stock 
our articles of incorporation  oregon law and our shareholder rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
our board of directors has the authority  without action by the shareholders  to designate and issue up to  shares of incentive stock in one or more series and to designate the rights  preferences and privileges of each series without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
additionally  the oregon control share act and the business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors 
in february  we adopted a shareholder rights plan  which has the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
the potential issuance of incentive stock  the provisions of the oregon control share act and the business combination act and our shareholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of us  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may materially adversely impact the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
our debt obligations expose us to risks that could materially adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition  and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 
we have a substantial level of indebtedness 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  which includes million of convertible subordinated notes notes due and million of floating rate convertible subordinated debentures debentures due this level of indebtedness among other things  could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt  make it difficult for us to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under the notes and debentures  or place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 
if we experience a decline in revenues due to any of the factors described in item a 
risk factors  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition

the company markets its products and services worldwide  primarily to large companies in the military aerospace  communications  computer  consumer electronics  semiconductor  networking  multimedia and transportation industries 
through the diversification of the company s customer base among these various customer markets  the company attempts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations within each market 
the company sells and licenses its products through its direct sales force and a channel of distributors and sales representatives 
in addition to its corporate offices in wilsonville  oregon  the company has sales  support  software development and professional service offices worldwide 
business environment business at the end of was strong and broad based with system and software bookings up in compared to the prior year 
bookings are the value of orders during a period for which revenue has been or will be recognized within six months for products and within twelve months for professional services and training 
during the three months ended december   the company experienced a increase in system and software revenues year over year 
after two consecutive quarters with year over year declines in the beginning of  system and software revenues in the third and fourth quarters of had year over year increases of and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   system and software revenues decreased from the comparable period of the ten largest transactions for the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately of total system and software bookings as compared to in the fourth quarter of the ten largest transactions for the full year accounted for approximately of total system and software bookings as compared to for the full year the number of new customers during the three months ended december  returned to historical levels  approximately flat with levels experienced during the comparable period of after a significant year over year bookings decline in the first half of  the calibre family of products had a strong second half of the year 
with strong second half bookings  the calibre products made up the deficit from first and second quarter and closed the year with cumulative bookings growth for the twelve months ended december  of 
the company continues to be confident in the long term health of this product line and does not believe the calibre weakness experienced in first half of indicates a future trend 
the company s management believes looks positive for the company and for the eda industry in general 
for the three months ended december   eight of the ten largest transactions were renewals of previous contracts 
for these eight renewals  the company experienced growth in contract renewal values reflecting increased design software usage 
based on expiring contracts  is expected to be a strong renewal year  and these contracts should benefit from the increased r d spending of our customers compared to three years ago in when r d spending in electronics was still depressed 
beyond the growth in the company s family of calibre products  the strength seen in new emerging products  including testkompress  scalable verification and system design  offer many opportunities for growth in the company also expects increased demand for eda products for non traditional markets  such as automotive electronic design and embedded software 
the company will continue its strategy of developing best in class point tools with number one market share potential 
this strategy creates a diversified product portfolio for the company that solves customers critical design problems 
the company s management believes that this product strategy  in conjunction with a customer diversification strategy  has helped reduce the impact of marketplace fluctuations in the past and should continue to do so in the future 
license model mix license model trends can have a material impact on various aspects of the company s business 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition on page for a description of the types of product licenses sold by the company 
as the mix among perpetual licenses  fixed term licenses term with upfront revenue recognition and term licenses with ratable revenue recognition which includes due and payable revenue recognition shifts  revenues  earnings  cash flow and days sales outstanding dso are either positively or negatively affected 
the year ended december  marked the fifth consecutive year in which  as a percentage of product revenue  term revenue increased while perpetual revenue decreased 
the company believes this trend will continue in this trend was primarily the result of two factors 
first  the company s customers continue to move toward the term license model  which provides the customer with greater flexibility for product usage  including the option to share the products between multiple locations and reconfigure consumption at regular intervals from a fixed product list 
as such  some of the company s customers have converted their existing installed base from perpetual to term licenses 
second  the weakness in the high technology economy has disproportionately impacted the company s smaller customers 
historically these customers have purchased under the perpetual license model 

table of contents under this ongoing shift from perpetual licenses to term licenses with upfront revenue recognition  which the company s management views as a positive trend  the company expects no measurable impact to earnings  but a negative impact on cash flow and dso 
as customers move away from perpetual licenses and into term licenses  the renewability and repeatability of the company s business is increased 
this provides opportunity for increased distribution of young products earlier in their lifecycles 
product developments during  the company continued to execute its strategy of focusing on new customer problem areas  as well as building upon its well established product families 
the company s management believes that customers  faced with leading edge design challenges  choose the best products in each category to build their design environment 
through both internal development and strategic acquisitions  the company has focused on areas where it believes it can build a leading market position or extend an existing leading market position 
during the year ended december   the company launched many new products to address customer s leading edge design challenges 
the company launched its constraint editor system ces into its expedition series and board station re pcb design flows 
providing a centralized constraint editor simplifies the task of managing constraints that previously had to be entered into individual tools in the flow separately 
also during the year ended december   the company launched questa 
the questa verification products extend mentor s functional verification solution by offering a single product with built in support for testbench automation  coverage driven verification cdv  assertion based verification abv and transaction level modeling tlm

the company s management believes that the development and commercialization of eda software tools is usually a multi year process with limited customer adoption in the first years of tool availability 
once tools are adopted  however  their life spans tend to be long and healthy 
the company s management believes that the company s relatively young and diverse product lines are positioned for growth over the long term 
financial performance total revenues were  a decrease from  primarily due to weakness in scalable verification partially offset by strength in ic design to silicon and new emerging markets

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company reports revenue in two categories based upon how the revenue is generated i system and software and ii service and support 
system and software revenues the company derives system and software revenues from the sale of licenses of software products and emulation hardware systems 
the company licenses software using two different license types term licenses are for a specified time period  typically three years with payments spread over the license term  and do not provide the customer with the right to use the product after the end of the term 
the company generally recognizes product revenue from term installment license agreements upon shipment and start of the license term 
the company uses these agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
if the company no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change would have a material impact on the company s near term results of operations 
in a situation in which a risk of concession may exist on a term license agreement  revenue is recognized on a due and payable basis  which is the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or the customer installments as they become due and payable 
in a term license agreement where the company provides the customer with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products  revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
perpetual licenses provide the customer with the right to use the product in perpetuity and typically do not provide for extended payment terms 
the company recognizes product revenue from perpetual license agreements upon delivery to the customer 
if the agreement provides for customer payment terms that are different than the standard payment terms in the customer s jurisdiction  product revenue is recognized as payments become due and payable 
service and support revenues service and support revenues consist of revenues from software and hardware maintenance services and professional services  which include consulting services  training services and other services 
the company records service revenue as the services are provided to the customer 
support revenue is recognized over the support term 
for multi element arrangements that include support  support is allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of support 
for term and perpetual licenses  vsoe is established by the price charged when such support is sold separately 
the company determines whether software product revenue recognition is appropriate based upon the evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists an agreement signed by the customer and the company or a qualified customer purchase order 
delivery has occurred the software has been shipped  the customer is in possession of the software or the software has been made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
fee is fixed or determinable the amount of the fee and the due date have been fixed at execution of the arrangement without the possibility of future adjustments or concessions 

table of contents collectibility is probable the customer is expected to pay for products or services without the company providing future concessions to the customer 
valuation of trade accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade accounts receivable and term receivables  long term for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when it becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
the company also records unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customers  the current business environment and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be adjusted resulting in either additional selling expense or a reduction in selling expense in the period such determination was made 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase either income or contributed capital  or decrease goodwill  in the period such determination was made 
also  if the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance on such net deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
income tax reserves the company has reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities  even though the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate 
the tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the company s potential liability for additional taxes 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is determined by comparing its carrying amount to the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the asset relates 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator using a fair value approach 
in the event that  in the future  it is determined that the company s goodwill  intangible or other long lived assets have been impaired  an adjustment would be made that would result in a charge for the write down in the period that determination was made 
inventory the company purchases and commits to purchase inventory based upon forecasted shipments of its emulation hardware systems 
the company evaluates  on a quarterly basis  the need for inventory reserves based on projections of systems expected to ship within six months 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established to account for the differences between forecasted shipments and the amount of purchased and committed inventory 
the company also has emulation hardware system demonstration and loan equipment at customer locations in anticipation of securing sales 
the cost of the emulation hardware system demonstration and loan equipment is amortized to selling expense using a six month useful life 

table of contents restructuring charges the company has recorded restructuring charges in connection with its plans to better align the cost structure with projected operations in the future 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred 
the company has recorded restructuring charges in connection with employee rebalances based on estimates of the expected costs associated with severance benefits 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  additional special charges will be recognized 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
the company has also recorded restructuring charges in connection with excess leased facilities to offset future rent  net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained  of the abandoned office space and to write off leasehold improvements on abandoned office space 
the company works with external real estate experts in each of the markets where properties are located to obtain assumptions used to determine the best estimate of the net loss 
the company s estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect the company s ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the real estate market 
if the real estate markets worsen and the company is not able to sublease the properties as expected  additional adjustments may be required  which would result in additional special charges in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens and the company is able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  a benefit to special charges will be recognized
