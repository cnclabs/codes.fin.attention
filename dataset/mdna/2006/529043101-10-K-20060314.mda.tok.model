item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company  which has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the code  acquires and manages net leased commercial properties throughout the united states 
the company believes it has operated as a reit since october as of december   the company owned or had interests in real estate properties encompassing million rentable square feet 
during  the company purchased properties  including non consolidated investments  for a capitalized cost of billion 
during  the company sold eight properties  including one in a non consolidated entity  to unrelated third parties for a net sales price of million 
in addition  the company contributed seven properties to its various non consolidated entities for million which approximated original cost 
as of december   the company  including its non consolidated entities  leased properties to tenants in different industries 
the company s revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
growth in revenue and cash flows is directly correlated to the company s ability to i acquire income producing properties and ii to release properties that are vacant  or may become vacant at favorable rental rates 
the challenge the company faces in purchasing properties is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising the company s real estate underwriting criteria 
the company believes it has access to acquisition opportunities due to its relationship with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers 
the company has experienced minimal lease turnover in the recent past  and accordingly  minimal capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that this will continue 
through  the company  including its non consolidated entities  has leases expiring which generate approximately million in base rent  including the company s proportionate share of base rent from properties owned by non consolidated entities 
releasing these properties and properties currently vacant at favorable effective rates is the primary focus of the company 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are i the period of time required to find a new tenant  ii whether rental rates will be lower than previously received  iii the significant leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and iv the payment of operating costs such as real estate taxes and insurance while there is no offsetting revenue 
the company addresses these risks by contacting tenants well in advance of lease maturity to get an understanding of their occupancy needs  contacting local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
as part of the acquisition underwriting process  the company focuses on buying general purpose real estate which can be leased to other tenants without significant modification to the properties 
no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 
during  the company sold eight properties to unrelated parties for a net sales price of million 
in addition  the company contributed eight properties to its various non consolidated entity programs for million  which approximated carrying costs 
in addition  the company was reimbursed for certain holding costs by the partners in the respective venture 
during  the company sold four properties for 
table of contents million to unrelated parties  which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately million 
during  the company contributed two properties to lion for million  which approximated carrying costs 
inflation certain of the company s long term leases on its properties contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive i scheduled fixed base rent increases and ii base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  a majority of the company s leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses 
in addition  the company s leases are structured in a way that minimizes its responsibility for capital improvements 
critical accounting policies the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
the company allocates the purchase price of real estate acquired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas requires that the fair value of the real estate acquired  which includes the impact of mark to market adjustments for assumed mortgage debt relating to property acquisitions  is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets  which includes land  building and improvements  and fixtures and equipment  of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and a management estimate of current market rents 
below market lease intangibles are recorded as part of deferred revenue and amortized into rental revenue over the non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
above market leases are recorded as part of intangible assets and amortized as a direct charge against rental revenue over the non cancelable portion of the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationships  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases and customer relationships are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases  as amended sfas 
sfas requires that revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
renewal options in leases with rental terms that are lower than those in the primary term are excluded from the calculation of straight line rent  if they do not meet the criteria of a bargain renewal option 
in those instances in which the company funds tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by the company  revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant 
when the company determines that the tenant allowances are lease incentives  the company commences revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  as amended sfas 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
accounts receivable 
the company continuously monitors collections from its tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that the company has identified 
as of december  and  the company did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of real estate 
the company evaluates the carrying value of all real estate held when a triggering event under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as amended sfas has occurred to determine if an impairment has occurred which would require the recognition of a loss 
the evaluation includes reviewing anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  and an estimate of what lease rents will be if the property is vacant coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
however  estimating market lease rents and future sale proceeds is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
depreciation is determined by the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic useful lives of the properties 
tax status 
the company has made an election to qualify  and believes it is operating so as to qualify  as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax  provided that distributions to its shareholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under sections through of the code 
the company is now permitted to participate in certain activities from which it was previously precluded in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code 
lra  lexington contributions inc lci and lsac are taxable reit subsidiaries 
as such  the company is subject to federal and state income taxes on the income it receives from these activities 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
properties held for sale 
the company accounts for properties held for sale in accordance with sfas sfas requires that the assets and liabilities of properties that meet various criteria be presented separately in the statement of financial position  with assets and liabilities being separately stated 

table of contents the operating results of these properties are reflected as discontinued operations in the income statement 
properties that do not meet the held for sale criteria of sfas are accounted for as operating properties 
basis of consolidation 
the company determines whether an entity for which it holds an interest should be consolidated pursuant to financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
if the entity is not a variable interest entity  and the company controls the entity s voting shares or similar rights  the entity is consolidated 
fin r requires the company to evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights 
liquidity and capital resources since becoming a public company  the company s principal sources of capital for growth have been the public and private equity markets  selective secured indebtedness  its unsecured revolving credit facility  issuance of op units and undistributed funds from operations 
the company expects to continue to have access to and use these sources in the future  however  there are factors that may have a material adverse effect on the company s access to capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon its existing leverage  the value of the assets the company is attempting to leverage and general economic conditions which may be outside of management s influence 
during  the company replaced its million unsecured revolving credit facility with a new million unsecured revolving credit facility which bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points depending on the leverage as defined of the company and matures in june the credit facility contains customary financial covenants including restrictions on the level of indebtedness  amount of variable rate debt to be borrowed and net worth maintenance provisions 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants  no borrowings were outstanding on the facility  million was available to be borrowed and million in letters of credit were outstanding 
during and  the company completed common share offerings of million and million shares  respectively  raising aggregate net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
during  the company issued  cumulative convertible preferred shares  at per share and a dividend rate of  raising net proceeds of million 
during  the company issued million cumulative convertible preferred shares at per share and a dividend rate of  raising net proceeds of million 
currently these million preferred shares are convertible into million common shares 
the company has made equity commitments of million to its various joint venture programs  of which million is unfunded as of december  this amount will be funded as investments are made 
in addition  the joint venture agreements provide the partners  under certain circumstances  the ability to put their interests to the company for cash or common shares 
exercise of these put rights could require the company to use its resources to purchase these assets instead of more favorable investment opportunities 
as of december   the aggregate contingent commitment is approximately million 
this assumes the company issues common shares to settle the put and that the company does not use its ability to block certain properties to be put to it 
dividends 
in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  the company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio as a percentage of ffo  reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in its portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as the board of trustees considers appropriate 
dividends paid to common shareholders increased to million in  compared to million in and million in preferred dividends paid were million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents although the company receives the majority of its base rent payments on a monthly basis  it intends to continue paying dividends quarterly 
amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by the company in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
the company believes that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  the company anticipates that cash on hand  borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility  issuance of equity and debt  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required by the company 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties and joint ventures 
cash provided by investing activities related primarily to collection of notes receivable and proceeds from the sale of properties 
therefore  the fluctuation in investing activities relates primarily to the timing of investments and dispositions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities during each year was primarily attributable to proceeds from equity offerings and non recourse mortgages offset by dividend and distribution payments and debt payments 
upreit structure 
the company s upreit structure permits the company to effect acquisitions by issuing to a property owner  as a form of consideration in exchange for the property  op units in operating partnerships controlled by the company 
all outstanding op units are redeemable at certain times for common shares on a one for one basis and substantially all outstanding op units require the company to pay quarterly distributions to the holders of such op units 
the company accounts for outstanding op units in a manner similar to a minority interest holder 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and minority interest expense should be expected to decrease  as such op units are redeemed for common shares 
the following table provides certain information with respect to such op units as of december  assuming the company s annualized dividend rate remains at the current per share 
current total annualized current total per op annualized redeemable for number affiliate unit distribution common shares of op units op units distribution at any time at any time at any time january january february may may november affiliate op units  which are included in total op units  represent op units held by the chairman of the company  e

the ability of the company to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  the company s equity in the mortgaged properties  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the mortgaged properties  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
the company expects to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages as it believes that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with a lease expiration the company s cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
in december  the company informed the lender for its milpitas  california property that it will no longer make debt service payments and its intention is to complete a deed in lieu of foreclosure to satisfy the mortgage

capital expenditures 
due to the net lease structure  the company does not incur significant expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain its properties 
however  as leases expire  the company expects to incur costs in extending the existing tenant leases or re tenanting the properties 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
these expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows or borrowings on the unsecured revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had entered into binding letters of intent to purchase two properties upon completion of i construction and commencement of rent from the tenants and or ii the seller fulfilling its contractual obligation concerning certain deliverables
