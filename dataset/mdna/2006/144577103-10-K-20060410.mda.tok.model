item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this form k 
the financial information in this section has been restated  as further discussed in item note financial restatement 
all period to period comparisons are based upon restated amounts 
our financial statements and the notes thereto  which are found elsewhere in the form k contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
restatement in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we reviewed our accounting policy used to account for our derivatives on interest rate swaps on the second lien credit facility and for oil and natural gas prices on our proved producing properties derivatives and determined that these instruments should have been accounted for as non designated derivatives instead of cash flow hedges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  as a result of the changes in accounting for our derivatives for interest rate swaps and the oil and natural gas hedges we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   as presented in this form k 
in addition to the financial statements for the year ended december   these changes in accounting affect the four quarterly periods of and the three quarterly periods ended september  which these restatements are also presented in this form k 

table of contents under cash flow hedge accounting  the after tax change in the fair value of the open derivative positions fair value change is reported as other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
alternatively  if the derivative does not qualify as a cash flow hedge  mark to market accounting requires that the fair value change be reported in earnings 
for our cash flow commodity hedges  we had accounted for the realized gain or losses on these hedging activities as being recognized in earnings as oil and natural gas revenues when the forecasted transaction occurred 
our derivative instruments had previously been accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the company has determined that the derivatives entered into in and were not timely designated as cash flow hedges and lacked sufficient documentation to be accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as a result  the company is restating its financial statements for the year ended december  and all the unaudited uarterly periods in and the first three quarters of all such derivatives in this restatement  including oil and gas derivatives and interest rate swaps  are now classified as non designated derivatives and are marked to market  with realized and unrealized gains and losses being reflected as mark to market gains losses on derivatives  net within the other income and expense section of the statement of income 
in the process of restating our financials to account for our derivatives on a mark to market basis  we discovered certain computational errors in the fair value of the company s derivatives that was previously reported in other comprehensive income in and these errors resulted from the information we had relied upon to establish oil and gas prices in connection with establishing the fair value of the derivatives 
for all the periods covered by our consolidated financial statements  we used a third party website source to obtain oil and gas market prices and to calculate the fair value of the derivatives 
however  we determined in the course of our evaluation that the information from the third party provider was not entirely reliable and that houston ship channel market prices should have been used in the fair value computation in place of new york mercantile nymex index prices 
nevertheless  in marking these derivatives to market  the gains and losses reflected in the other income and expense have been based upon corrected fair valuations and were not based upon the information from the third party provider 
additionally  during the audit of pinnacle gas resources  inc  an error was discovered that affects amounts that had previously been reported on the company s quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september  the error arose as a result of the incorrect accounting for certain natural gas derivatives which had historically been accounted for using the cash flow method 
pinnacle s management and its independent registered public accountants have determined that these derivatives are not eligible for cash flow hedge accounting 
accordingly  pinnacle restated its quarters using the non designated derivatives accounting method 
the relative change in the fair value of these derivatives due to changing commodity price are reflected as a gain or loss in pinnacle s earnings each quarter 
because the company s interest in pinnacle is accounted for using the equity method  the company determined that the effect of pinnacle s restatement of its financial statements required the company to  in turn  restate its own financial statements 
where appropriate  notes to the consolidated financial statements and certain other disclosures in this form k have been adjusted to conform to these restatements 
general overview for the year ended december   we achieved record annual drilling success rates  levels of production  natural gas and oil revenues and at the end of our proved oil and gas reserves also reached a record level 
due to our drilling success  we produced a record bcfe in compared to bcfe in at the end of  we also reached a record estimated proved reserves level of bcfe with bcfe of net additions for the year  replacing of our production 
see business and properties natural gas and oil reserve replacement 
in  we drilled wells net  including wells in the onshore gulf coast area  wells in the barnett shale play and wells in the camp hill field  with an apparent success rate of compared to an apparent success rate of in  in which we drilled wells net  in the onshore gulf coast and barnett shale areas combined 
between january  and december   of our wells drilled were exploratory and were developmental 
in  of these wells were exploratory and were developmental 
this increase in our percentage of developmental wells reflects our increased activity in the barnett shale area  which has a relatively higher concentration of development well targets than the onshore gulf coast area 
in  our natural gas and oil revenues reached a record level at million  and our net income available to common shareholders was million  or and per basic and fully diluted share  respectively 
in  our natural gas and oil revenues were million  and our net income available to common shareholders was million  or and per basic and fully diluted share  respectively 
these increases in natural gas and oil revenues and net income were attributable in part to the record levels of production discussed above and to higher commodity prices 
our financial results are largely dependent on a number of factors  including commodity prices 
commodity prices are outside of our control and historically have been and are expected to remain volatile 
natural gas prices in particular have remained volatile during the last few years 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil prices  and therefore  cannot accurately predict revenues 
in  our realized natural gas price was higher and our realized oil price was higher than in because natural gas and oil prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as swaps  collars  futures and options to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations associated with a portion of our natural gas and oil production and to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from potential increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our derivative arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices 
we have continued to reinvest a substantial portion of our operating cash flows into funding our drilling program and increasing the amount of d seismic data available to us 
in  we expect capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest and overhead to be approximately to million  as compared to million in 
table of contents in  we plan to drill gross wells net in the onshore gulf coast area  gross wells net in our barnett shale area and to gross wells to net in our east texas area  primarily in our camp hill oil field 
the actual number of wells drilled will vary depending upon various factors  including the availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and industry partner issues  our cash flow  success of drilling programs  weather delays and other factors 
if we drill the number of wells we have budgeted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization  oil and natural gas operating expenses and production are expected to increase over levels incurred in our ability to drill this number of wells is heavily dependent upon the timely access to oilfield services  particularly drilling rigs 
the shortage of available rigs in delayed the drilling of several wells  slowing our growth in production 
at december   our net debt to total net capitalization ratio computed as total debt net of cash net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus total book equity was  an increase from the ratio at the end of computed as total debt divided by 

this increase was primarily the result of our july debt refinancing and borrowings under our million second lien credit facility which generated net proceeds of million after a retiring million of outstanding obligations under our senior subordinated notes and senior secured subordinated notes and b repaying the million of outstanding indebtedness under our first lien credit facility  partially offset by the million of net proceeds from the private placement of million shares of common stock in june the equity and debt changes are described under liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
since our initial public offering  we have grown primarily through the exploration of properties within our project areas  although we consider acquisitions from time to time and may in the future complete acquisitions that we find attractive 
in and we completed asset acquisitions in our barnett shale project area described below in barnett shale activity 
public offering and private placement of common stock in the first quarter of  we completed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the offering included  newly issued shares offered by us and  shares offered by certain selling shareholders 
our net proceeds of approximately million from this offering were used to accelerate our drilling program  to retain larger interests in portions of our drilling prospects that we otherwise would sell down or for which we would seek joint partners  to fund a portion of our activities in the barnett shale area and for general corporate purposes 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling shareholders 
in the second quarter of  we sold million shares of our common stock or approximately of the fully diluted shares outstanding before the offering to institutional investors at a price of per share in a private placement the private placement  a discount to the close price on the nasdaq stock market for our common stock the day prior to pricing 
the net proceeds from the private placement  after the placement agents fees but before offering expenses  were approximately million 
we used the proceeds from the private placement to fund a portion of our capital expenditure program  including our drilling programs in the barnett shale and onshore gulf coast areas 
in connection with the private placement  we were required to file a resale shelf registration statement to register the resale of the shares sold under the securities act 
we filed such registration statement and are required to cause it to become and be kept effective for resale of shares for two years from the date of their original sale 
in certain situations  we are required to indemnify the investors in the private placement  including without limitation  for certain liabilities under the securities act 
barnett shale area in mid  we became active in the barnett shale play located in tarrant and parker counties in northeast texas 
our activity accelerated as a result of the acquisition on february  of working interests and acreage in certain oil and gas wells located in the newark east field in denton county  texas in the barnett shale trend for million the barnett shale acquisition 
this acquisition included non operated working interests in properties ranging from to over  gross acres  or an average working interest of 
the acquisition included existing gross wells net and interests in approximately  net acres 
in april  we acquired leases and producing wells in the barnett shale for approximately million which consisted of approximately net acres and working interests in existing gross wells net with an estimated mmcfe of proved reserves  based upon our internal estimates 
all of the interests in the wells acquired related to wells in which we already had an interest 
the consideration paid for this acquisition was million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
initially  we financed our barnett shale activities with our available cash on hand 
we financed a portion of our capital expenditure program for the barnett shale area with funds from the october issuance of the senior subordinated secured notes 
in june and july  we completed the private placement and entered into the second lien credit facility see public offering and private placement common stock above and financing arrangements second lien credit facility and refinancing  below  a portion of the net proceeds of which were used to partially fund our ongoing capital expenditure program  including our drilling programs in the barnett shale and onshore gulf coast areas 

table of contents in the barnett shale area  we drilled gross wells net in and gross wells net in  all of which were successful 
we plan to drill gross wells net in this area in we may seek to finance a portion of our remaining barnett shale activities with borrowings under our first lien credit facility 
in particular we may need to seek other financing alternatives if the future borrowing base under the first lien credit facility is insufficient in partially funding our drilling program 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
at the end of our net production had risen to approximately mmcfe d with gross wells on line and another gross wells in various stages of testing  completion and awaiting pipeline hookup 
as of march   our estimated net production was mmcfe d 
in addition to our drilling activity  we have continued to expand our barnett shale acreage position  growing our net leasehold acreage from approximately  to  acres  at the end of and  respectively 
similarly  we have increased our estimated number of developmental locations from to horizontal locations  at the end of and  respectively  and we have increased our estimated number of exploratory drilling locations horizontal in the barnett shale area from to locations  at the end of and  respectively 
pinnacle gas resources  inc during the second quarter of  we acquired interests in natural gas and oil leases in wyoming and montana in areas prospective for coalbed methane and subsequently began to drill wells on those leases 
during the second quarter of  we through ccbm  our wholly owned subsidiary contributed our interests in certain of these leases to a newly formed company  pinnacle gas resources  inc pinnacle 
in exchange for this contribution  we received of the common stock of pinnacle and options to purchase additional pinnacle common stock 
we account for our interest in pinnacle using the equity method 
as a result  our contributed operations and reserves are no longer directly reflected in our financial statements 
in march  credit suisse first boston private equity entities the csfb parties contributed additional funds of million into pinnacle to fund its development program  which increased the csfb parties ownership to on a fully diluted basis assuming we and us energy corp 
each elect not to exercise our available options 
in  the csfb parties contributed million to pinnacle to finance an acquisition of additional undeveloped acreage 
ccbm and us energy corp 
elected not to participate in the equity contribution 
in november  the csfb parties and a former pinnacle employee received  and  shares of pinnacle common stock  respectively  after exercising certain warrants and options 
accordingly  ccbm s ownership in pinnacle is at december  on a fully diluted basis 
we understand that pinnacle is in the process of raising additional capital to expand its operations  which may result in a further dilution of our interest 
if pinnacle engages in any such activities that involve the issuance of additional equity  we could be diluted to an extent where we would no longer use the equity method of accounting to account for our investment in pinnacle 
as of december   on a fully diluted basis  assuming that all parties exercised their pinnacle warrants and pinnacle stock options  the csfb parties  ccbm and us energy corp 
would have ownership interests of approximately  and  respectively 
in addition to our interest in pinnacle  we have maintained interests in approximately  gross acres at the end of in the castle rock coalbed methane project area in montana and the oyster ridge project area in wyoming 
see business and properties pinnacle transaction for a description of this transaction 
our discussion of future drilling and capital expenditures does not reflect operations conducted through pinnacle 
derivative transactions our financial results are largely dependent on a number of factors  including commodity prices

the gas production volume increases were partially offset by production declines from the delta farms and the beach house wells  which were shut in for workovers during the second and third quarters of  the temporary shut in of a number of wells as a result of the katrina and rita hurricanes  and the sale of the shadyside in the first quarter of the decrease in oil production volume was principally due to production declines from the aforementioned workovers  the hurricane related shut ins  and a natural production decline for the hankamer oil and natural gas revenues include the impact of hedging activities as discussed below under volatility of oil and gas prices

it is likely that pinnacle will continue to record a valuation allowance on the deferred federal tax benefit generated from the operating losses incurred during the early development stages of pinnacle s coalbed methane project 
concurrently  we will record valuation allowances relative to our share of pinnacle s financial results

we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on terms that would be acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate financing  we anticipate that we may be required to limit or defer our planned natural gas and oil exploration and development program  thereby adversely affecting the recoverability and ultimate value of our natural gas and oil properties

table of contents in september  we entered into an agreement to purchase over an month period a non exclusive license to certain geophysical data at a cost which will range from million to million  contingent upon whether we exercise another option to acquire additional data under the agreement 
we have accelerated the development of our camp hill project 
in august  management proposed the acceleration of the camp hill development to our board of directors 
accordingly  a development plan was formally approved by the board for increased drilling activity in the camp hill field  beginning with an initial well drilling program 
in february  our board of directors formally approved a multi year plan to fully develop the entire camp hill field 
in furtherance of this plan  we expect to drill between and gross wells to net in this area at an estimated cost of million during to fully develop the field  we expect to drill approximately wells from through  at a total cost of approximately million and total operating costs including steam of approximately million 
the precise timing and amount of our expenditures on additional well drilling and increased steam injection to develop the proved undeveloped reserves in this project will depend on several factors including the relative prices of oil and natural gas 
our board of directors recently approved a revised development plan for increased drilling activity in two tracts in the camp hill field in our east texas area 
during  we have drilled seven gross wells net in this area  all of which are apparent successes 
over the next months  we expect to drill between and gross wells to net  including to gross wells in  in this area at an estimated cost of approximately million 
through the end of  pinnacle has reported that it has drilled gross wells since inception and estimates that of these wells have been completed 
pinnacle reportedly added approximately bcfe of net proved reserves through development drilling through december   excluding the bcfe contributed or acquired at inception 
its gross operated production has increased by approximately since its inception to approximately mmcf d at december   and its total well count stands at gross operated wells  according to pinnacle 
because of the nature of coalbed methane wells that require an extended dewatering period before significant natural gas production  pinnacle has not been able to complete its determination on commerciality of all of these wells

summary of critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the use of these estimates significantly affects our natural gas and oil properties through depletion and the full cost ceiling test  as discussed in more detail below 
significant estimates include volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculating depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties  future net revenues and abandonment obligations  impairment of undeveloped properties  future income taxes and related assets liabilities  bad debts  derivatives  contingencies and litigation 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production depletion and the ceiling test  have numerous inherent uncertainties 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  reserve estimates are vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas 
such prices have been volatile in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future 
the significant estimates are based on current assumptions that may be materially effected by changes to future economic conditions such as the market prices received for sales of volumes of oil and natural gas  interest rates  the market value of our common stock and corresponding volatility and our ability to generate future taxable income 
future changes to these assumptions may affect these significant estimates materially in the near term 

table of contents oil and natural gas properties we account for investments in natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting 
all costs directly associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties are capitalized 
these costs include lease acquisitions  seismic surveys  and drilling and completion equipment 
we proportionally consolidate our interests in natural gas and oil properties 
we capitalized compensation costs for employees working directly on exploration activities of million  million and million in  and respectively 
we expense maintenance and repairs as they are incurred 
we amortize natural gas and oil properties based on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserve quantities 
we do not amortize investments in unproved properties until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until these investments are impaired 
we periodically evaluate  on a property by property basis  unevaluated properties for impairment 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  we add the amount of impairment to the proved natural gas and oil property costs to be amortized 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and  where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
the depletion rate per mcfe for  and was  and respectively 
we account for dispositions of natural gas and oil properties as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
we have not had any transactions that significantly alter that relationship 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a ceiling test which limits such costs to the estimated present value  discounted at a interest rate  of future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions the full cost ceiling 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to operations through depreciation  depletion and amortization 
in connection with our year end ceiling test computation  a price sensitivity study also indicated that a percent increase in commodity prices at december  would have increased the pre tax present value of future net revenues npv by approximately million 
conversely  a percent decrease in commodity prices at december  would have reduced our npv by approximately million 
the aforementioned price sensitivity and npv is as of december  and  accordingly  does not include any potential changes in reserves due to first quarter performance  such as commodity prices  reserve revisions and drilling results 
the full cost ceiling cushion at the end of of approximately million was based upon average realized oil and natural gas prices of per bbl and per mcf  respectively  or a volume weighted average price of per boe 
this cushion  however  would have been zero on such date at an estimated volume weighted average price of per boe 
a boe means one barrel of oil equivalent  determined using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one bbl of oil  condensate or natural gas liquids  which approximates the relative energy content of oil  condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to natural gas 
prices have historically been higher or substantially higher  more often for oil than natural gas on an energy equivalent basis  although there have been periods in which they have been lower or substantially lower 

table of contents under the full cost method of accounting  the depletion rate is the current period production as a percentage of the total proved reserves 
total proved reserves include both proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves 
the depletion rate is applied to the net book value and estimated future development costs to calculate the depletion expense 
proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the proved reserves decline  then the depletion rate the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  reducing net income 
we have a significant amount of proved undeveloped reserves  which are primarily oil reserves 
we had bcfe  bcfe  and bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves  representing  and of our total proved reserves at december   and  respectively 
as of december   and  a portion of these proved undeveloped reserves  or approximately  bcfe  bcfe and bcfe  respectively  are attributable to our camp hill properties that we acquired in see business and properties east texas area camp hill project for further discussion of the camp hill properties 
the estimated future development costs to develop our proved undeveloped reserves on our camp hill properties are relatively low  on a per mcfe basis  when compared to the estimated future development costs to develop our proved undeveloped reserves on our other oil and natural gas properties 
furthermore  the average depletable life the estimated time that it will take to produce all recoverable reserves of our camp hill properties is considerably longer  or approximately years  when compared to the depletable life of our remaining oil and natural gas properties of approximately years 
accordingly  the combination of a relatively low ratio of future development costs and a relatively long depletable life on our camp hill properties has resulted in a relatively low overall historical depletion rate and dd a expense 
this has resulted in a capitalized cost basis associated with producing properties being depleted over a longer period than the associated production and revenue stream  causing the build up of nondepleted capitalized costs associated with properties that have been completely depleted 
this combination of factors  in turn  has had a favorable impact on our earnings  which have been higher than they would have been had the camp hill properties not resulted in a relatively low overall depletion rate and dd a expense and longer depletion period 
as a hypothetical illustration of this impact  the removal of our camp hill proved undeveloped reserves starting january  would have reduced our earnings by i an estimated million in comprised of after tax charges for a million full cost ceiling impairment and a million depletion expense increase  ii an estimated million in due to higher depletion expense and iii an estimated million in due to higher depletion expense  and iv an estimated million in due to higher depletion expense 
we expect our relatively low historical depletion rate to continue until the high level of nonproducing reserves to total proved reserves is reduced and the life of our proved developed reserves is extended through development drilling and or the significant addition of new proved producing reserves through acquisition or exploration 
if our level of total proved reserves  finding cost and current prices were all to remain constant  this continued build up of capitalized costs increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
we depreciate other property and equipment using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates the proved reserve data as of december  included in this document are estimates prepared by ryder scott company  degolyer and macnaughton  and fairchild wells  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on judgment and the interpretation of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions regarding drilling and operating expense  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the sec mandates some of these assumptions such as oil and natural gas prices and the present value discount rate 
proved reserve estimates prepared by others may be substantially higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ from actual results  reserve quantities actually recovered may be significantly different than estimated 
material revisions to reserve estimates may be made depending on the results of drilling  testing  and rates of production 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 

table of contents our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for proved properties is dependent on our estimate of proved reserves 
if these reserve estimates decline  the rate at which we record these expenses will increase 
a increase or decrease in our proved reserves would have increased or decreased our depletion expense by for the year ended december  as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were proved undeveloped and proved nonproducing 
moreover  some of the producing wells included in our reserve reports as of december  had produced for a relatively short period of time as of that date 
because most of our reserve estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis  those estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure based on seismic analysis 
in addition  realization or recognition of our proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans 
lack of certainty with respect to development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 
we have from time to time chosen to delay development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the camp hill field in east texas in favor of pursuing shorter term exploration projects with higher potential rates of return  adding to our lease position in this field and further evaluating additional economic enhancements for this field s development 
the average life of the camp hill proved undeveloped reserves is approximately years  with of these reserves being booked over years ago 
although we have recently accelerated the pace of the development of the camp hill project  there can be no assurance that the aforementioned discontinuance will not occur 
derivative instruments upon entering into a derivative contract  the company must either designate the derivative instruments as a hedge of the variability of cash flow to be received cash flow hedge or the derivatives must be accounted for as fair value hedges 
we typically use fixed rate swaps and costless collars to manage our risk of exposure to material changes in the price of natural gas and oil 
changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent that the derivative is effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
any ineffectiveness in the relationship between the cash flow hedge and the hedged item is recognized currently in income 
gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge are recognized in earnings as oil and natural gas revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
all of the company s derivative instruments at december  and had been designated as cash flow hedges 
however  in connection with the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   the company determined that it had not timely designated the instruments as a cash flow hedges and was lacking certain other documentation for the derivatives entered into during the periods of and as a result  the company is restating in this form k the consolidated financial information for and the quarterly financial data for all periods in and the first three quarters in  accounting for them as non designated derivatives 
accordingly  these derivatives will be marked to market at the end of each period and the realized and unrealized gain or loss will be recorded as market to market gains and losses on derivatives  net within other income on the company s statement of income 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the financial restatement 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings immediately 
in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  the derivative will be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with future changes in its fair value recognized in future earnings 
for a discussion of the impact of changes in the prices of oil and gas on our hedging transactions  see volatility of oil and natural gas prices below 
our board of directors sets all of our risk management policies  and reviews volumes  types of instruments and counterparties  on a quarterly basis 
these policies are followed by management through the execution of trades by either the president or chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president  chief financial officer and chairman of the board 
the master contracts with the authorized counterparties identify the president and chief financial officer as the only representatives authorized to execute trades 
the board of directors also reviews the status and results of derivative activities quarterly 
during the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to amounts outstanding under the second lien credit facility 
these arrangements are designed to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations during the period beginning january  through june  by effectively exchanging existing obligations to pay interest based on floating rates for obligations to pay interest based on fixed libo rates 
these derivatives will be marked to market at the end of each period and the realized and unrealized gain or loss will be recorded as market to market gains and losses on derivatives  net within other income on the company s statement of income 

table of contents income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income taxes are recognized at each year end for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  it is reduced by a valuation allowance 
however  despite our attempt to make an accurate estimate  the ultimate utilization of our deferred tax assets is highly dependent upon our actual production and the realization of taxable income in future periods 
contingencies liabilities and other contingencies are recognized upon determination of an exposure  which when analyzed indicates that it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and that the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors natural gas and oil prices are highly volatile  and lower prices will negatively affect our financial results 
we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the commission 
see critical accounting policies and estimates oil and natural gas properties and risk factors we may record ceiling limitation write downs that would reduce our shareholders equity 
total oil purchased and sold under swaps and collars during  and were  bbls   bbls and  bbls  respectively

the net losses realized by us under such derivative arrangements were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and were included in oil and gas revenue for and mark to market gain loss on derivative  net for and to mitigate some of our commodity price risk  we engage periodically in certain other limited derivative activities including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we record the costs and any benefits derived from these price floors as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in natural gas and oil sales revenue  the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december  and  unrealized gain and losses on oil and gas derivatives of million or 
million after tax and million or million  respectively  were also included in mark to market gain losses on derivatives  net 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
we enter into the majority of our derivative transactions with two counterparties and have a netting agreement in place with those counterparties 
we do not obtain collateral to support the agreements but monitor the financial viability of counterparties and believe our credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
under these arrangements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed again to price risk 
we have some risk of financial loss because the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
moreover  our derivative arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our hedges will vary from time to time 
our gas derivative transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the houston ship channel index for 
table of contents the last three trading days of a particular contract month 
our oil derivative transactions are generally settled based on the average reporting settlement prices on the west texas intermediate index for each trading day of a particular calendar month 
for the month of december  a change in the price per mcf of gas sold would have changed revenue by million 
a change in the price per barrel of oil would have changed revenue by  at december  and we had the following outstanding derivative positions december  contract volumes average fixed price average floor price average ceiling price quarter bbls mmbtu first quarter first quarter second quarter second quarter third quarter third quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter december  contract volumes average fixed price average floor price average ceiling price quarter bbls mmbtu first quarter first quarter second quarter second quarter third quarter third quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter the table below summarizes our total natural gas production volumes subject to derivative transactions during natural gas swaps natural gas caps volumes mmbtu  volumes mmbtu  average price mmbtu average price mmbtu floor ceiling the table below summarizes our total crude oil production volumes subject to derivative transactions during crude oil swaps crude oil caps volumes bbls  volumes bbls  average price bbls average price bbls floor ceiling

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility have been discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on our annual revenues and operating income 
to mitigate some of this risk  we engage periodically in certain limited hedging activities  including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection 
costs and any benefits derived from these price floors are accordingly recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenue and were not significant for any year presented 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
income and losses realized by us related to these instruments were million  million and million or  and per mmbtu for the years ended december    and  respectively
