as a result of these acquisitions  internal growth and cost management  from to  we experienced growth in net sales and operating profitability 
management believes that nutraceutical is well positioned to continue to capitalize on the consolidation we believe is occurring in the vms industry 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america required us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates included values and lives assigned to acquired intangible assets  reserves for customer returns and allowances  uncollectible accounts receivable and slow moving and obsolete and or damaged inventory 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our estimates and judgments related to our critical accounting policies  including factors and assumptions considered in making these estimates and judgments  did not vary significantly for the periods presented and had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements as reported 
our critical accounting policies include the following accounts receivable provision is made for estimated bad debts based on a periodic analysis of individual customer balances  including an evaluation of days sales outstanding  payment history  recent payment trends and perceived credit worthiness 
if general economic conditions and or customer financial condition were to change  additional provisions for bad debts may be required  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
inventories provision is made for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory based on a periodic analysis of individual inventory items  including an evaluation of historical usage and or movement  age  expiration date and general condition 
if market demand and or consumer preferences are less favorable than historical trends or future expectations  additional provisions for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory may be required  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expense is impacted by our judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of assets placed in service 
if the estimated lives of assets are significantly less than expected  depreciation and amortization expense would be accelerated  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  require estimates and judgments in determining the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets  including factors and assumptions used in determining fair value and useful lives 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  while intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
in addition  sfas requires ongoing  periodic impairment testing  which relies on such factors and assumptions as identified reporting units  as well as expected future net cash flows relative to recorded book values 
if an asset impairment were identified  a loss would be recorded  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that these criteria are satisfied upon shipment from our facilities or  in the case of our neighborhood natural food markets and health food stores  at the point of sale within these stores 
revenue is reduced by provisions for estimated returns and allowances  which are based on historical averages that have not varied significantly for the periods presented  as well as specific known claims  if any 
no other significant deductions from revenue must be estimated at the point in time that revenue is recognized

other net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was related to the integration of the fiscal acquisition of cornucopia community market  inc and the fiscal acquisition of pilgrim s natureway llc  partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales  which we believe was somewhat related to decreased low carb consumer interest and demand

selected quarterly financial data  seasonality the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for fiscal and this quarterly information is unaudited  has been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and  in our opinion  reflects all normally recurring adjustments necessary for fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in thousands  except per share data unaudited net sales gross profit net income net income per common share basic diluted we believe that our business is characterized by minor seasonality 
however  sales to any particular customer can vary substantially from one quarter to the next based on such factors as industry trends  timing of promotional discounts  international economic conditions and acquisition related activities 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  we have historically recorded higher branded products sales volume during the second fiscal quarter due to increased interest in health related products among consumers following the holiday season 
the fiscal acquisitions were completed during the first and second quarters and the fiscal acquisition was completed during the second quarter 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended september    and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash provided by changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions  as well as the gain related to the sale of our building located in park city  utah  partially offset by an increase in net income 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended september    and  respectively 
our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses and during the year ended september   proceeds of million related to the sale of our building 
capital expenditures during the years ended september    and related primarily to real estate  distribution and manufacturing equipment  building improvements related to facility consolidation efforts and information systems  including retail technology 
on march   we purchased the rapid response center in ogden  utah  which when fully converted will provide approximately  square feet of gross building space located on approximately acres  which includes available land for expansion  for million in cash 
the rapid response center is the central facility where we are  and have been  consolidating operations  including raw material warehousing  manufacturing  packaging  distribution and administrative offices 
we were previously leasing most of this facility 
we intend to finance anticipated capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow and  if necessary  through funds provided under our revolving credit facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended september    and  respectively 
our financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility related to operating needs  purchases of common stock for treasury and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
on january   we entered into a five year  sixty million dollar reducing revolving credit facility 
on september   we amended this revolving credit facility the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement extends the term of the credit facility to september  resets the available credit borrowings to sixty million with no automatic reductions and provides an accordion feature which can increase the available credit borrowings to ninety million  subject to approval by the lenders and compliance with certain covenants and conditions 
deferred financing fees of approximately thousand related to the amended credit agreement were capitalized 
at september   we had outstanding revolving credit borrowings of million under the amended credit agreement 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all our assets and bear interest at the applicable eurodollar rate plus a variable margin or at a base rate  which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime lending rate  plus a variable margin 
at september   the applicable weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings was 
we are also required to pay a variable quarterly fee on the unused balance under the amended credit agreement 
at september   the applicable rate was 
accrued interest on eurodollar rate borrowings is payable based on elected intervals of one  two or three months 
accrued interest on base rate borrowings is payable quarterly 
the amended credit agreement matures on september   and we are required to repay all principal and interest outstanding under the amended credit agreement on such date 
the amended credit agreement contains restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring other indebtedness and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios 
as of september   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
upon the occurrence of a default or an event of default  the lender has various remedies or rights  which may include proceeding against the collateral or requiring us to repay all amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement 
a key component of our business strategy is to seek to make additional acquisitions  which may require that we obtain additional financing  which could include the occurrence of substantial additional indebtedness 
we believe that borrowings under the amended credit agreement or a replacement credit facility  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to make required payments under the amended credit agreement or any such replacement facility  and to make anticipated capital expenditures and fund working capital needs for fiscal our significant non cancelable contractual obligations as of september  were as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt a operating leases total a represents estimated interest obligations associated with our outstanding revolving credit facility balance of million at september   assuming no principal payments are made before maturity  a weighted average interest rate of and an underutilization fee rate of 
captive insurance company due to increases in the number of product ingredients excluded from existing insurance policies  as well as potential increases in coverage costs  we established and provided funding for a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  american nutritional casualty insurance  inc  which was incorporated in hawaii 
this entity provides coverage for certain of our product liability risks  depending on the availability  pricing and terms of coverage from the traditional insurance market 
we have funded this captive insurance subsidiary with capital contributions  and we pay premiums based on actuarial estimates and input 
new accounting standards in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin in june the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not determined the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review new accounting standards that are issued from time to time 
although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to us  we have not identified any other new standards that we believe merit further discussion  and we expect that none would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation affects the cost of raw materials  goods and services used by us 
in recent years  inflation has been modest 
the competitive environment somewhat limits our ability to recover higher costs resulting from inflation by raising prices 
we seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation primarily through improved productivity and cost containment programs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented  except with respect to increased costs in manufacturing  packaging and distribution resulting from increased fuel and other petrochemical costs  as well as payroll related costs  insurance premiums  and other costs arising from or related to government imposed regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at the applicable eurodollar rate plus a variable margin or at a base rate  which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime lending rate  plus a variable margin 
at september   the applicable weighted average interest rate for borrowings was and we had total borrowings outstanding of million 
to date  we have not obtained interest rate protection with respect to these borrowings 
with respect to our international operations  we are subject to currency fluctuations  however  we do not believe that these fluctuations would have a material adverse impact on our financial position because the majority of our net sales to foreign countries are transacted in us dollars 
to date  we have not hedged any of our potential foreign currency exposures
