three year summary of segment information certain financial information on our reporting segments and other specialty converting businesses for the three years ended december   which appear in note segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of our annual report to shareholders  are incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents other matters we use various raw materials  primarily paper  plastic films and resins  and specialty chemicals  which we purchase from a variety of commercial and industrial sources and which are subject to price fluctuations 
although from time to time shortages could occur  these raw materials currently are generally available 
we produce a majority of our self adhesive materials using water based emulsion and hot melt adhesive technologies 
emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds  which can be regulated by agencies of federal  state  local and foreign governments 
we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 
a portion of our manufacturing process for self adhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which  unless controlled  would be emitted into the atmosphere 
emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal  state  local and foreign governments 
in connection with the acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment  we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 
we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems 
emulsion adhesives  hot melt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in our facilities in peachtree city  georgia  fort wayne and greenfield  indiana  and quakertown  pennsylvania  as well as in other plants in the united states  argentina  australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  colombia  france  germany  india  korea  luxembourg  malaysia  mexico  the netherlands  south africa  thailand and united kingdom 
based on current information  we do not believe that the costs of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  consolidated financial position or results of operations

risk factors our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks  including but not limited to  the following potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and investigations regarding competitive activities and other legal  compliance and regulatory matters  including those involving product liability  product and trade compliance  foreign corrupt practices act issues and other matters  could impact us materially 
our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations  including  without limitation  any relating to the us department of justice s antitrust division doj criminal investigation  as well as the european commission ec  canadian department of justice  and australian competition and consumer commission investigations  into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof including purported class actions in the united states seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices  and purported class actions related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices  which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation  as well as a likely fine by the ec in respect of certain employee misconduct in europe 
see item  legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 
the demand for our products is impacted by economic conditions of the principal countries in which we operate 
a decline in the economies in these countries could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we have operations in over countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control  including changes in the political  social  economic  tax and 
table of contents regulatory environments including tariffs in the countries in which we operate  as well as the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for our products 
in addition  approximately percent of our sales are in foreign currencies  which fluctuate in relation to one another and to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction  translation and other losses to us  which can negatively impact our sales and profitability 
we operate in some highly competitive markets 
if we do not compete effectively  we could lose market share and experience falling prices  adversely affecting our financial results 
we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive 
there is also the possibility that competitors will be able to offer additional products  services  lower prices  or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
as a manufacturer  our sales and profitability are also dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy  which are subject to price fluctuations  and the ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 
inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials  labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to recur  and our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on to customers changes in costs in our selling prices for products and through improvements in productivity 
also  it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of materials  equipment  and packaging from suppliers 
a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
our future results may be affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 
we are undergoing efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations  including closure of facilities  headcount reductions  organizational simplification  process standardization  and using a variety of tools such as lean sigma and kaizen events  to accomplish this productivity  which is not assured 
lower levels of productivity could result in lower production  sales  and profitability 
cost reduction actions  in turn  could expose us to additional production risk 
slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our profitability 
our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key end use markets or applications for our products 
our overall performance will be influenced by these markets 
our customers are widely diversified  but in certain portions of our business  industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 
in particular  sales of our office and consumer products in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers  principally office product superstores  mass market distributors and wholesalers 
the business risk associated with this concentration  including increased credit risks for these and other customers  and the possibility of related bad debt write offs  could negatively affect our margins and profits 
our ability to develop and successfully market new products and applications is important in maintaining growth 
the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success 
research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends 
we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers 

table of contents infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents could harm our ability to grow 
because our products involve complex technology and chemistry  we are sometimes involved in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property 
parties have filed  and in the future may file  claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we could be held to be liable to pay damages or obtain licenses 
there can be no assurance that licenses will be available  and the cost to defend these infringement claims and to develop new technology could be significant 
we also could have our intellectual property infringed 
we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information  but it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information and develop similar technologies 
in addition  many of the countries in which we operate have limited or no protection for intellectual property rights 
the costs involved to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  which may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results 
the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings in future periods 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries who we rely on as experts 
in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return  or health care costs  our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population  the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results  which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost 
we have acquired and may continue to acquire other companies 
these acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties  including integration  technology and personnel 
in order to grow our product lines and to expand into new markets  we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future 
many risks  uncertainties  and costs are associated with the acquisitions 
the integration of systems  objectives  personnel  product lines  markets  customers  suppliers  and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain 
there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability 
in order for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 
there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees 
due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions  it may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees 
we need to comply with many environmental  health  and safety laws 
due to the nature of our business  we are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes 
we have accrued liabilities for environmental clean up sites  including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party  where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities  future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites  which could be identified in the future for cleanup  could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

table of contents in order to mitigate risk  it is important that we obtain various types of insurance 
we have various types of insurance including health  life  and property 
since the terrorist attacks  insurance premiums have risen considerably and recent natural disasters will likely result in an additional increase in insurance premiums 
as the cost of insurance continues to increase  our financial results could be adversely affected 
significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations  sales  customer relations  and financial results 
we rely on a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions 
like other information technology systems  ours is susceptible to damage or interruptions caused by natural disasters  power failures  viruses and security breaches 
we upgrade and install new systems  which if installed or programmed incorrectly  could cause significant disruptions 
if a disruption occurs  we could incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of operations 
our share price has been volatile 
our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general 
other factors  including market expectations for our performance  the level of perceived growth of our industries  and announcements concerning industry investigations  have also impacted our share price 
there can be no assurance that our stock will be less volatile in the future 
if our credit ratings are downgraded  we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and long term financing from capital markets 
credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings 
standard and poor s s p has assigned us a credit rating of a for short term and a for long term financing 
s p has given us a negative outlook 
moody s investors service moody s has assigned us a credit rating of p for short term and a for long term financing 
moody s has given us a stable outlook 
if our credit ratings were to be downgraded  our financial flexibility would decrease and the cost to borrow would increase 
we have no assurance that the current credit ratings will be maintained 
our reputation  sales  and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 
there are occasions when we ship products with quality issues resulting from defective materials  manufacturing  packaging or design 
many of these issues are discovered before shipping but this causes delays in shipping  delays in the manufacturing process  and occasionally cancelled orders 
when the issues are discovered after shipment  this causes additional shipping costs  possible discounts  possible refunds  and potential loss of future sales 
both pre shipping and post shipping quality issues can result in financial consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation 
some of our products are sold by third parties 
our products are not only sold by us  but by third party distributors and retailers as well 
some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products 
changes in the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of these third parties could affect our sales and profitability 
we outsource some of our manufacturing 
if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers  our business could be negatively impacted 
we manufacture most of our products  but occasionally third party manufacturers are needed for specialty jobs or capacity overflow 
outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to control product failure  late deliveries  customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards 
because of possible quality problems and customer dissatisfaction  outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents the risks described above are not exclusive 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be less significant may also have an adverse effect on us 
if any of the above risks actually occur  our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition could suffer  which might cause the value of our securities to decline

table of contents item legal proceedings the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa and or other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites  which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and or groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company s liability has been agreed 
the company is participating with other prps at all such sites  and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 
the company has accrued liabilities for all sites  including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp  where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities  future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 
amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and  based upon current information  management believes it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

this conduct violated the company s policies and in some cases constituted an infringement of ec competition law 
as a result  the company expects that the ec will fine the company when its investigation is completed 
the ec has wide discretion in fixing the amount of a fine  up to a maximum fine of of a company s annual revenue 
because the company is unable to estimate either the timing or the amount or range of any fine  the company has made no provision for a fine in its financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview and outlook overview sales our sales from continuing operations increased in compared to growth in  reflecting the factors summarized in the following table 
estimated change in sales due to core unit volume pricing product mix foreign currency translation acquisitions core unit volume is a measure of sales performance that excludes the estimated impact of acquisitions  divestitures  changes in product mix and pricing  and currency translation 
we use this measure to evaluate underlying demand for our products and services  and to assess sales trends over time 
the decrease in core unit volume in reflects the following factors loss of market share in our north american roll materials business following our implementation of selling price increases to offset higher raw material costs the impact of an extra week in the fiscal year accelerated purchases by office and consumer products customers in advance of our selling price increases  which contributed to higher growth in in addition to the factors noted above for  core unit volume also benefited in that year from additional sales in the retail information services segment as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas in january the improvement in pricing and product mix in was primarily due to the impact of selling price increases implemented to offset higher raw material costs 
cost reduction actions in  we initiated company wide cost reduction efforts which are expected to improve our global operating efficiencies 
these actions include reductions in headcount  which impact most businesses and geographic regions and expected divestitures of low margin businesses and product lines 
in connection with these actions  we recorded cash and non cash charges related to severance and other employee related costs  as well as asset impairments 
the charges are detailed in cost reduction actions below 
as a result of our expected sale of a business in that manufactures raised reflective pavement markers and the divestiture of our package label converting business in europe in october discussed below in acquisitions and divestitures  the discussions which follow generally reflect summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted 
however  the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations

this benefit was partially offset by a decrease in core unit volume due in part to the impact of the extra week in a decline in core unit volume in north america  which reflected market share loss related to price increases  was partially offset by growth from international sales 
foreign currency translation also contributed to sales growth for this segment 
operating income for this segment increased million or in  reflecting cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives  including the closure of two european plants during the first six months of operating income for this segment included charges related to restructuring costs and asset impairment in both and the impact of higher raw material costs was offset by selling price increases 

table of contents office and consumer products of net sales our office and consumer products segment reported a decrease in sales in compared to the decrease in sales was primarily due to the impact of accelerated purchases in by customers in advance of our selling price increases  and the impact of an extra week in the decrease in core unit volume was partially offset by a positive impact of changes in pricing and product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
operating income for this segment decreased million or  reflecting lower sales volume and the write off of inventories and equipment  primarily due to a product launch 
operating income for this segment included a charge related to restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in these decreases were partially offset by cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives 
the selling price increases offset the cumulative effect of raw material inflation since the beginning of retail information services of net sales the retail information services segment reported a increase in sales in compared to approximately of the increase was due to core unit volume growth  reflecting continued growth of the business in asia and latin america 
the benefit to core unit volume was partially offset by additional sales in as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas in january the balance of the growth reflected incremental sales from acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
operating income for this segment decreased million or due to charges for restructuring and asset impairments in and higher spending associated with growth initiatives 
partially offsetting these factors was the benefit of productivity improvement actions  including the ongoing migration of production from hong kong to lower cost facilities in mainland china 
other specialty converting businesses of net sales other specialty converting businesses reported a increase in sales in compared to due to core unit volume growth  as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
operating income for these businesses decreased million or reflecting costs related to the development of the rfid business and charges related to restructuring costs and asset impairments in in  due to the commercialization of our rfid business  we have included rfid in this group of businesses 
financial results of this group have been restated for years presented herein to reflect this change 
sales growth by region excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestitures  and foreign currency translation  we estimate sales growth decline in major regions of operation as follows us europe asia latin america in the us  the decrease in was partially due to market share loss and a slow market in pressure sensitive materials  as well as accelerated purchases in by office and consumer products customers in advance of our selling price increases 
these negative factors were partially offset by selling price increases 
weaker demand in the us also reflected a practice among end users of our products to move manufacturing outside the us this shift is offset by growth in emerging markets  where manufacturing has moved 

table of contents in asia  the pace of growth in moderated throughout the region  including china 
the comparison to was also affected by additional sales in the retail information services segment in as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas in january in latin america  the roll materials business was affected by market share loss as a result of selling price increases  although there was a benefit from higher selling prices 
in addition to the factors above  the impact of the extra week in also affected comparisons of growth between and for all regions 
cost reduction actions and other expense in millions  pretax restructuring costs asset impairment lease cancellation charges losses from product line divestitures other other expense  net during the fourth quarter of  we announced cost reduction actions related to restructuring and anticipated product line divestitures discussed in acquisitions and divestitures below

these actions impact most businesses and geographic regions and are expected to be completed by the end of the restructuring actions  including anticipated charges in early  are expected to result in annualized pretax savings of million to million when completed 
we expect to reinvest some of the savings into future growth opportunities 
in addition to the fourth quarter charges  other charges were recorded earlier in including the closure of our gainesville  georgia label converting plant  which was completed during the third quarter of also included in other expense in was an accrual for legal expenses related to a patent lawsuit  offset by gains on the sale of assets

free cash flow in millions net cash provided by operating activities purchase of property  plant and equipment purchase of software and other deferred charges free cash flow free cash flow for decreased million  due primarily to lower net income 
the changes in assets and liabilities were partially offset by lower cash spending on capital in see analysis of results of operations and liquidity below for more information 
free cash flow refers to cash flow from operating activities less spending on property  plant and equipment  and software 
we use free cash flow as a measurement tool to assess the cash flow available for other corporate purposes  such as dividends  debt service and repurchase of common stock

table of contents impact of foreign currency translation in millions change in net sales change in net income while there was a benefit from foreign currency translation in  this decreased significantly in compared to prior years  due to strengthening of the us dollar 
the benefit in reflected the strength of the euro  brazilian real  canadian dollar and korean won  against the us dollar 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales  because our products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold 
as a result  the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales is matched with a partially offsetting impact on reported expenses  thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income

analysis of selected financial ratios we utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance  as discussed in detail below 
working capital ratio working capital current assets minus current liabilities  as a percent of net sales  decreased in primarily due to an increase in short term debt 
working capital from continuing operations  as a percent of net sales  is shown below 
we use this non gaap measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements  because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing activities 
the timing of financing activities is not necessarily related to our current operations and would tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period 
our objective is to minimize our investment in working capital from operations by reducing this ratio  to maximize cash flow and return on investment 
working capital from continuing operations in millions a working capital current assets minus current liabilities reconciling item short term and current portion of long term debt b working capital from continuing operations c net sales working capital  as a percent of net sales a c working capital from continuing operations as a percent of net sales b c in  the increase in working capital from continuing operations  as a percent of sales  was primarily due to changes in accounts payable  income taxes payable  cash and cash equivalents and refundable income taxes  partially offset by the change in other accrued liabilities and trade accounts receivable 
these changes included the impact of currency 

table of contents accounts receivable ratio the average number of days sales outstanding was days in compared to days in  calculated using a four quarter average accounts receivable balance 
this decrease reflects improved collections efforts across the businesses 
inventory ratio average inventory turnover was in both and  calculated using a four quarter average inventory balance 
for purposes of comparability  the ratio was calculated using a week year for debt ratios year end requirement total debt to total capital debt covenant ratios total debt to earnings before other expense  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization not to exceed earnings before other expense  interest and taxes to interest at least the decrease in total debt to total capital was due to a decrease in total debt outstanding 
our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of income 
we were in compliance with these covenants as shown in the table above 
the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities 
at year end and  the fair value of our total debt  including short term borrowings  was billion and billion  respectively 
shareholders equity ratios return on average shareholders equity return on average total capital decreases in these returns in compared to were primarily due to lower net income 
these ratios are computed using actual net income and a five quarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts 
capital resources capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt financing 
we maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates 
these financing arrangements consist of our commercial paper programs in the us and europe  committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we operate  callable commercial notes and long term debt  including medium term notes 
capital from debt our total debt decreased approximately million in to billion compared to billion at year end  reflecting payments of debt and the effect of foreign currency translation 

table of contents in july  we entered into a revolving credit agreement with ten domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of million  expiring july  we use the financing available under this agreement as a commercial paper back up facility and to finance other corporate requirements 
there was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of year end in addition  we have a day revolving credit facility with a foreign bank to provide up to euro million million in borrowings through july  we may extend the revolving period and due date with the approval of the bank  on an annual basis 
our intention is to renegotiate an extension of this facility in financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our european operations 
as of year end  million was outstanding under this agreement 
we had standby letters of credit outstanding of million and million at the end of and  respectively 
our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately million at year end our uncommitted lines of credit do not have a commitment expiration date  and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time 
in the fourth quarter of  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to permit the issuance of up to million in debt and equity securities 
proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing existing debt  and for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
as of december   no securities had been issued under the registration statement 
credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
when determining a credit rating  the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position  business outlook  consistency of cash flows  debt level and liquidity  geographic dispersion and management team 
the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings 
our credit ratings as of year end short term long term outlook standard poor s rating service a a negative moody s investors service p a stable contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations at year end payments due by period total thereafter in millions short term lines of credit long term debt and capital leases interest on long term debt operating leases pension and postretirement benefit contributions total contractual obligations interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the index rate in effect as of december  we enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation 
the terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations  except for the facility in mentor  ohio as noted below 
the table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms of one year or more 

table of contents we did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end in the table of contractual obligations above  because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems 
in january  we contributed million to our domestic pension plan  which is more than the amount required by us governmental agencies for industry investigations in april  we were notified by the doj that it had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry  and on august   the doj issued a subpoena to us in connection with the investigation 
in may  the ec initiated inspections and obtained documents from our pressure sensitive materials facilities in the netherlands and germany  seeking evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities 
in july  we were notified by the competition law division of the department of justice of canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation 
in august  we were notified by the australian competition and consumer commission that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation 
we are cooperating with these investigations 
we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices  which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation 
we are also a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices 
we have discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in our european operations that constituted an infringement of ec competition law 
we accordingly expect that the ec will impose a fine on us when its investigation is completed 
we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time  although the effect could well be adverse and material 
these matters are reported in note contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa and or other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites  which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and or groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon 
we are participating with other prps at such sites  and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 
we have accrued liabilities for such sites  including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp  where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities  future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 
amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position  and based upon current information  we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other we have contacted relevant authorities in the us and reported the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act 
the transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflectives business in china  and involved  among other things  impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments 
the payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration 
corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken 
sales of our reflectives business in china in were approximately million 
based on findings to date  no changes to our previously filed financial statements are 
table of contents warranted as a result of these matters 
however  we expect that fines or other penalties may be incurred 
while we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties  we believe that our behavior in detecting  investigating  responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably 
we and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits  claims and inquiries  most of which are routine to the nature of the business 
based upon current information  we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us 
we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized 
these costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold  historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units  cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage 
as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations  we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 
on september   we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility to be located in mentor  ohio 
this facility will be the new headquarters for our roll materials worldwide division  and will consist generally of land  buildings  equipment and office furnishings and equipment the facility 
we will lease the facility under an operating lease arrangement  which contains a residual value guarantee of million 
we do not expect the residual value of the facility to be less than the amount guaranteed 
we participate in receivable financing programs  both domestically and internationally  with several financial institutions whereby we may request advances from these financial institutions 
at december   we guaranteed approximately million of these advances 
we guaranteed up to approximately million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries obligations to their suppliers as of december  in connection with the l e acquisition in  we issued  shares at per share 
we also entered into an agreement with l e whereby in the event the value of our common shares fell below the price of the shares that were issued to l e adjusted for dividends received  during the period from january  through december   l e had the option to exercise a true up right 
upon exercise of this true up right  we had the option to pay the difference in value to l e  in the form of a cash or b common shares  or repurchase the shares at the issued share price  adjusted for dividends paid 
the true up obligation was reduced by any shares sold by l e to third parties 
during  l e sold  shares to third parties 
on october   l e notified us that it was exercising its true up right under the agreement for the remaining  shares 
we repurchased the remaining shares under the agreement for million in the fourth quarter of related party transactions from time to time  we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties 
we believe that such transactions are at arm s length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties

mr 
mullin is also the majority stockholder of mc  minc and pwm collectively referred to as the mullin companies 
we paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the mullin companies in connection with several of our employee benefit plans 
the mullin companies have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance 
the majority of these commissions were allocated to and used by mc insurance agency services  llc an affiliate of mc to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under several of our employee benefit plans 
the mullin companies own a minority interest in m financial holdings  inc mfh 
substantially all of the life insurance policies  which we placed through the mullin companies in 
table of contents and prior years  are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and m life insurance company m life  a wholly owned subsidiary of mfh 
reinsurance returns earned by m life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive  depending upon the results of m life s aggregate reinsurance pool  which consists of the insured lives reinsured by m life

mullin s direct indirect interest in reinsurance gains subject to risk of forfeiture critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and which require us to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  accounts receivable allowances  inventory reserves  long lived asset impairments  pensions and postretirement benefits  income taxes  restructuring and severance costs and litigation 
revenue recognition sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
sales  provisions for estimated sales returns  and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers 
actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 
sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate 
volume  promotional  price  cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales 
rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold 
these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products 
we review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
sales returns and allowances sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers both affiliated and non affiliated for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return 
we accrue for 
table of contents returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products 
we record these allowances based on the following factors i customer specific allowances  and ii an estimated amount  based on our historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
accounts receivable allowances we are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy  historical experience and future expectations 
the allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
we record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule  and iii an estimated amount  based on our historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
no single customer represented or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end and however  our ten largest customers at year end represented approximately of trade accounts receivable and consisted of six customers of our office and consumer products segment  three customers of our pressure sensitive materials segment and one customer of both these segments 
the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in progress or finished goods 
inventory reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
we use estimates to record these reserves 
slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 
long lived asset impairments we record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long lived assets are determined not to be recoverable 
impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value 
fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices  if available  or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
pensions and postretirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return  or health care costs  future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population  the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results  which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost 
discount rate we  in consultation with our actuaries  annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations 
the assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
in the us  our discount rate was determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds 
the projected pension benefit payment streams were then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflected the liability duration unique to our plans 

table of contents long term return on assets we determine the long term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets  taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater return over the long run 
additionally  current market conditions  such as interest rates  are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
healthcare cost trend rate our practice is to fund the cost of the postretirement benefits on a cash basis 
for measurement purposes  an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for this rate is expected to decrease to approximately by income taxes deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when establishing a valuation allowance  we consider future sources of income such as forecasted earnings  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and prudent and feasible tax planning 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if later it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
we believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis 
restructuring and severance costs we account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in sfas no 
 accounting for postemployment benefits  and sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in the us  we have a severance pay plan pay plan  which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions 
we calculate severance pay using the severance benefits formula under the pay plan 
accordingly  we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under sfas no 
in the absence of a pay plan  liability for severance and other employee related costs are recognized when the liability is incurred and follow the guidance of sfas no 
litigation we are currently involved in various lawsuits  claims and inquiries  most of which are routine to the nature of the business  and in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims 
the ultimate resolution of these claims could affect our future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period should 
table of contents our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued 
recent accounting requirements during  we adopted several accounting and financial disclosure requirements by the financial accounting standards board fasb  emerging issues task force eitf and financial interpretations by the fasb  none of which has had a significant impact on our financial results of operations and financial position 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
in january  we adopted the recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  following the guidance under modified prospective application and expect that the associated expense will be approximately million in based on unvested stock options outstanding at year end such expense will have an estimated 
per share impact on earnings after tax 
risk factors safe harbor statement the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements  which are not statements of historical fact  may contain estimates  assumptions  projections and or expectations regarding future events  which may or may not occur 
words such as aim  anticipate  assume  believe  continue  could  estimate  expect  guidance  intend  may  objective  plan  potential  project  seek  shall  should  target  will  would  or variations thereof and other expressions  which refer to future events and trends  identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements  and financial or other business targets  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results  performance or achievements of the company expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in part  item a  risk factors above  and include  but are not limited to  risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new production facilities  timely development and successful market acceptance of new products  fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials  ability of the company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions  impact of competitive products and pricing  business mix shift  credit risks  ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements  fluctuations in pension  insurance and employee benefit costs  successful integration of acquisitions  successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment  customer and supplier concentrations  financial condition and inventory strategies of customers  changes in customer order patterns  loss of significant contract s or customer s  legal proceedings  including the doj criminal investigation  as well as the european commission ec  canadian department of justice  and australian competition and consumer commission investigations  into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices  and purported class actions related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices  which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation  as well as a likely fine by the ec in respect of certain employee misconduct in europe  impact of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act based on issues in china  changes in governmental regulations  fluctuations in interest rates  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations  changes in economic or political conditions  acts of war  terrorism  natural disasters  impact of epidemiological events on the economy  the company s customers and suppliers  and other factors 

table of contents the company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial expectations in the near term include potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and or investigations regarding competitive activities  including possible fines  penalties  judgments or settlements  the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the company s products  the impact of competitors actions  including expansion in key markets  product offerings and pricing  the degree to which higher raw material costs can be passed on to customers through selling price increases and previously implemented selling price increases can be sustained  without a significant loss of volume  and the ability of the company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions 
any forward looking statements should also be considered in light of the factors detailed in part  item a  risk factors  above 
the company s forward looking statements represent judgment only on the dates such statements were made 
by making any forward looking statements  the company assumes no duty to update them to reflect new  changed or unanticipated events or circumstances  other than as may be required by law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency  interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
as a result  we enter into foreign exchange forward  option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs  when available and appropriate 
the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve our objectives  we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
in connection with the issuance of the million year senior notes in  we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately million 
the loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over years  which corresponds to the term of the related debt 
additionally  we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations 
these amounts are not material to our financial statements 
in the normal course of operations  we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions  other risks associated with foreign operations  commodity price risk and litigation risk  which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

table of contents foreign exchange value at risk we use a value at risk var model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts 
this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions 
firm commitments  accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were included in the model 
forecasted transactions  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency 
the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on two year historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks 
a confidence level was used for a one day time horizon 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately million at year end interest rate sensitivity an assumed basis point move in interest rates of our weighted average interest rate on floating rate debt affecting our variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on our earnings
