item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s financial performance continues to be dependent in large part upon the growth in its outstanding loans receivable  the ongoing introduction of new products and services for marketing to its customer base  the maintenance of loan quality and acceptable levels of operating expenses 
since march   gross loans receivable have increased at a annual compounded rate from million to million at march  the increase reflects both the higher volume of loans generated through the company s existing offices and the contribution of loans generated from new offices opened or acquired over the period 
during this same five year period  the company has grown from offices to offices as of march  the company plans to open or acquire at least new offices in each of the next two years 
the company continues to identify new products and services for marketing to its customer base 
in addition to new insurance related products  which have been introduced in selected states over the last several years  the company sells and finances electronic items and appliances to its existing customer base in many states where it operates 
this program is called the world class buying club 
total loan volume under this program was million during fiscal  a increase from the prior fiscal year 
while this represents less than of the company s total loan volume  it remains a very profitable program  which the company plans to continue to emphasize in fiscal and beyond 
the company s paradata financial systems subsidiary provides data processing systems to separate finance companies  including the company  and currently supports approximately  individual branch offices in states and mexico 
paradata s revenue is highly dependent upon its ability to attract new customers  which often requires substantial lead time  and as a result its revenue may fluctuate greatly from year to year 
during fiscal  its net revenues from system sales and support amounted to million  approximately the same as in fiscal paradata s pretax income contribution to the company also can fluctuate greatly 
it was   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
paradata s net revenue and resulting net contribution to the company will continue to fluctuate on a year to year basis  but management believes this business should remain profitable over the long term 
additionally  and more importantly  paradata continues to provide state of the art data processing support for the company s in house integrated computer system at little or no net cost to the company 
since fiscal  the company has expanded its product line to include larger balance  lower risk  and lower yielding individual consumer loans 
these loans typically average  to  with terms of to months  compared to smaller loans  which average to  with terms of to months 
the company offers the larger loans in all states except texas  where they are not profitable under our lending criteria and strategy 
additionally  the company has purchased over the years numerous larger loan offices and has made several bulk purchases of larger loans receivable 
as of march   the larger loan category accounted for approximately million of gross loans receivable  an increase over the balance outstanding at march  at the end of the current fiscal year  this portfolio was of the total loan balances  a decrease from the previous year mix of 
management believes that these loans provide lower expense and loss ratios  and thus provide positive contributions 
while the company does not intend to change its primary lending focus from its small loan business  it does intend to continue expanding the larger loan product line as part of its ongoing growth strategy 
in fiscal  the company tested an income tax return preparation and refund anticipation loan program in of its offices 
based on the results of this test  the company expanded this program in fiscal into substantially all of its offices 
the company prepared approximately  and  returns in each of the fiscal years and  respectively 
net revenue generated by the company from this program during fiscal amounted to approximately million 
the company believes that this profitable business provides a beneficial service to its existing customer base and plans to continue to promote and expand the program in the future

critical accounting policies the company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the finance company industry 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies involve significant judgment by the company s management  including the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
as a result  changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company considers its policies regarding the allowance for loan losses to be its most critical accounting policy due to the significant degree of management judgment 
the company has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that take into consideration various assumptions and estimates with respect to the loan portfolio 
the company s assumptions and estimates may be affected in the future by changes in economic conditions  among other factors 
for additional discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses  see credit quality below 
credit quality the company s delinquency and net charge off ratios reflect  among other factors  changes in the mix of loans in the portfolio  the quality of receivables  the success of collection efforts  bankruptcy trends and general economic conditions 
delinquency is computed on the basis of the date of the last full contractual payment on a loan known as the recency method and on the basis of the amount past due in accordance with original payment terms of a loan known as the contractual method 
management closely monitors portfolio delinquency using both methods to measure the quality of the company s loan portfolio and the probability of credit losses 
the following table classifies the gross loans receivable of the company that were delinquent on a recency and contractual basis for at least days at march    and at march  dollars in thousands recency basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable contractual basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable loans are charged off at the earlier of when such loans are deemed to be uncollectible or when six months have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment 
the company s charge off policy has been consistently applied  and no significant changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported 
management considers the charge off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
at the end of fiscal  the company experienced a decrease in contractual delinquency to from at march  the delinquency rate on a recency basis also decreased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of the current fiscal year 
charge offs as a percent of average loans increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  approximately of the company s loans were generated through renewals of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers 
a renewal represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer 
for fiscal   and  the percentages of the company s loan originations that were renewals of existing loans were   and  respectively 
the company s renewal policies  while limited by state regulations  in all cases considers our customer s payment history and require that our customer have made at least one payment on the loan being considered for renewal 
a renewal is considered a current renewal if the customer is no more than days delinquent on a contractual basis 
delinquent renewals may be extended to customers that are more than days past due on a contractual basis if the customer completes a new application and the manager believes that the customer s ability and intent to repay has improved 
it is the company s policy to not renew delinquent loans in amounts greater than the original amounts financed 
in all cases  a customer must complete a new application every two years 
during fiscal  delinquent renewals represented of the company s total loan volume compared to in fiscal charge offs  as a percentage of loans made by category  are greatest on loans made to new borrowers and less on loans made to former borrowers and renewals 
this is as expected due to the payment history experience available on repeat borrowers 
however  as a percentage of total loans charged off  renewals represent the greatest percentage due to the volume of loans made in this category 
the following table depicts the charge offs as a percent of loans made by category and as a percent of total charge offs during fiscal loan volume percent of percent of by category total charge offs loans made renewals former borrowers new borrowers the company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount that  in management s opinion  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the company charges against current earnings  as a provision for loan losses  amounts added to the allowance to maintain it at levels expected to cover probable losses of principal 
when establishing the allowance for loan losses  the company takes into consideration the growth of the loan portfolio  the mix of the loan portfolio  current levels of charge offs  current levels of delinquencies  and current economic factors 
in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 the company accrues an estimated loss if it is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
it is probable that there are losses in the existing portfolio 
to estimate the losses  the company uses historical information for net charge offs and average loan life 
this methodology is based on the fact that many customers renew their loans prior to the contractual maturity 
average contractual loan terms are approximately nine months and the average loan life is approximately four months 
based on this methodology  the company had an allowance for loan losses that approximated six months of average net charge offs at march    and therefore  at each year end the company had an allowance for loan losses that covered estimated losses for its existing loans based on historical charge offs and average lives 
in addition  the entire loan portfolio turns over approximately times during a typical twelve month period 
therefore  a large percentage of loans that are charged off during any fiscal year are not on the company s books at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the company believes that it is not appropriate to provide for losses on loans that have not been originated  that twelve months of net charge offs are not needed in the allowance  and that the methodology employed is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company records acquired loans at fair value based on current interest rates  less an allowance for uncollectibility and collection costs 
statement of position no 
sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  was adopted by the company on april  sop prohibits carryover or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of the sop 
management believes that a loan has shown deterioration if it is over days delinquent 
the company believes that loans acquired since the adoption of sop have not shown evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination  and therefore  are not within the scope of sop because we do not pay consideration for  or record  acquired loans over days delinquent 
for the years ended march   and  the company recorded adjustments of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  to the allowance for loan losses in connection with acquisitions in accordance generally accepted accounting principles 
these adjustments represent the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans which are not within the scope of sop the company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses in the existing portfolio at march  the following is a summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended march    and march balance at the beginning of the year provision for loan losses loan losses recoveries allowance on acquired loans balance at the end of the year allowance as a percentage of loans receivable  net of unearned and deferred fees net charge offs as a percentage of average loans receivable average loans receivable have been determined by averaging month end gross loans receivable less unearned interest and deferred fees over the indicated period 
quarterly information and seasonality the company s loan volume and corresponding loans receivable follow seasonal trends 
the company s highest loan demand typically occurs from october through december  its third fiscal quarter 
loan demand has generally been the lowest and loan repayment highest from january to march  its fourth fiscal quarter 
loan volume and average balances typically remain relatively level during the remainder of the year 
this seasonal trend affects quarterly operating performance through corresponding fluctuations in interest and fee income and insurance commissions earned and the provision for loan losses recorded  as well as fluctuations in the company s cash needs 
consequently  operating results for the company s third fiscal quarter generally are significantly lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter are significantly higher than in other quarters 
the following table sets forth  on a quarterly basis  certain items included in the company s unaudited consolidated financial statements and shows the number of offices open during fiscal years and at or for the three months ended first  second  third  fourth  first  second  third  fourth  dollars in thousands total revenues provision for loan losses general and administrative expenses net income gross loans receivable number of offices open recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer effective april   the company adopted statement of position no

this sop prohibits carryover or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of the sop

the company believes that the loans acquired since the adoption of sop have not shown evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination  and therefore  are not within the scope of sop  because we do not pay consideration for  or record  acquired loans over days delinquent 
accordingly  the adoption of sop on april   has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

equity classified awards are measured at grant date fair value  amortized over the subsequent vesting period  and are not subsequently remeasured 
the company will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective transition method on april  based on our current analysis and information  we believe the adoption of sfas r will result in a pre tax expense of between million and million for fiscal estimating the value of the stock option awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
accounting for nonmonetary transactions in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

 which eliminates the requirement to reflect changes in accounting principles as cumulative adjustments to net income in the period of the change and requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for voluntary changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
if it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of the change to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be adopted prospectively 
for new accounting pronouncements  the transition guidance in the pronouncement should be followed 
retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used 
sfas did not change the guidance for reporting corrections of errors  changes in estimates or justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company adopted the provisions of sfas on april  the adoption of this statement did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
the interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligations as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to the legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  the interpretation requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred  if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the interpretation also clarifies when sufficient information is available to reasonable estimated the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company began applying the interpretation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the application of the interpretation did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position

expenditures by the company to open and furnish new offices generally averaged approximately  per office during fiscal new offices have also required from  to  to fund outstanding loans receivable originated during their first months of operation 
the company acquired a net of three offices and a number of loan portfolios from competitors in states in separate transactions during fiscal gross loans receivable purchased in these transactions were approximately million in the aggregate at the dates of purchase 
the company believes that attractive opportunities to acquire new offices or receivables from its competitors or to acquire offices in communities not currently served by the company will continue to become available as conditions in local economies and the financial circumstances of owners change 
the company has a million base credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
in addition to the base revolving credit commitment  there is a million seasonal revolving credit commitment available november of each year through march of the immediately succeeding year to cover the increase in loan demand during this period 
the credit facility will expire on september  funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either the agent bank s prime rate per annum or the libor rate plus per annum 
at march   the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was 
the company pays a commitment fee equal to per annum of the daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility may not exceed specified percentages of eligible loans receivable

the company was in compliance with these agreements at march  and does not believe that these agreements will materially limit its business and expansion strategy 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations by period in thousands fiscal year ended march  thereafter total maturities of notes payable minimum lease payments total the company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility will be adequate for the next twelve months  and for the foreseeable future thereafter  to fund the expected cost of opening or acquiring new offices  including funding initial operating losses of new offices and funding loans receivable originated by those offices and the company s other offices 
management is not currently aware of any trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that it believes will result in  or are reasonably likely to result in  the company s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
from time to time  the company has needed and obtained  and expects that it will continue to need on a periodic basis  an increase in the borrowing limits under its revolving credit facility 
the company has successfully obtained such increases in the past and anticipates that it will be able to do so in the future as the need arises  however  there can be no assurance that this additional funding will be available or available on reasonable terms if and when needed 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s financial instruments consist of the following cash  loans receivable  senior notes payable  and an other note payable and an interest rate swap 
fair value approximates carrying value for all of these instruments 
loans receivable are originated at prevailing market rates and have an average life of approximately four months 
given the short term nature of these loans  they are continually repriced at current market rates 
the company s outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility was million at march  interest on borrowings under this facility is based  at the company s option  on the prime rate or libor plus based on the outstanding balance at march   a change of in the interest rates would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis

foreign currency exchange rate risk in september we began opening offices in mexico  where our local businesses utilize the mexican peso as their functional currency 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are denominated in us dollars and are therefore subject to fluctuation as the us dollar and mexican peso foreign exchange rates change 
international revenues were less than of our total revenues for the year ended march  and net loans denominated in mexican pesos were approximately million usd at march  our foreign currency exchange rate exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material effect on our financial results 
there have been  and there may continue to be  period to period fluctuations in the relative portions of mexican revenues 
on april   we hedged our foreign exchange risk by purchasing a million foreign exchange currency option with a strike rate of mexican peso per us dollar 
this option expires on april  changes in the fair value of this option will be recorded as a component of earnings since the company does not intend to apply hedge accounting 
because our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  we have performed an analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the mexican peso in which our transactions in mexico are denominated 
at march   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the actual effects on the consolidated financial statements in the future may differ materially from results of the analysis for the year ended march  we will continue to monitor and assess the effect of currency fluctuations and may institute further hedging alternatives 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
while increases in operating costs would adversely affect the company s operations  the consumer lending laws of two of the eleven states in which the company operates allow indexing of maximum loan amounts to the consumer price index 
these provisions will allow the company to make larger loans at existing interest rates in those states  which could partially offset the potential increase in operating costs due to inflation 
legal matters as of march   the company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions arising from their normal business activities in which damages in various amounts are claimed 
although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined  the company believes that any such liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole
