item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed beginning on page during  we discontinued our south louisiana gathering and processing operations previously part of our field services segment and our international power operations at our nejapa  cebu and east asia utilities power plants 
our operating results for all periods presented reflect these operations as discontinued 
overview business purpose and description 
our business purpose is to provide natural gas and related energy products in a safe  efficient and dependable manner 
we own north america s largest natural gas pipeline system and are a large independent natural gas and oil producer 
we also maintain an energy marketing and trading business that supports the marketing of our natural gas and oil production and the management of the risk associated with commodity prices 
during the past several years we have sold nearly billion of assets to reduce debt and improve liquidity 
these businesses were either not core to our long term objectives or were performing below the expectations we had for them at the time we made the investment 
these divestitures have resulted in significant financial losses through asset impairments  realized losses on asset sales and reduction of income from the businesses sold 
we have sold substantially all of our power and midstream assets and in we expect to be substantially complete with the divestiture of our non core activities 
drivers of our profitability 
our future profitability will be driven by a number of factors including our ability to pipelines expand our existing pipeline systems and gain access to new supply areas and sources contract and recontract pipeline capacity with our customers successfully resolve our pending rate cases improve operational efficiency exploration and production marketing and trading increase our natural gas and oil proved reserve base and production volumes through successful drilling programs or acquisitions and efficient operations manage commodity price risk to optimize the amounts we receive for the commodities we sell other successfully manage and complete the orderly exit of our legacy assets and trading positions successfully resolve legacy contingencies reduce debt levels and interest costs summary of operational financial performance in during  we continued to develop our core pipeline and exploration and production operations 
our pipelines delivered strong financial performance and our exploration and production business stabilized 
however  our earnings were negatively impacted by substantial mark to market losses on our natural gas and power derivative contracts due to commodity price increases  impairment charges taken in conjunction with the divestiture of non core assets and accruals for potential obligations related to various legacy matters 
additionally  the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita affected our pipeline and production operations in the second half of listed below and in the individual segment results that follow is a further discussion of the events affecting as well as progress in our key areas of focus 
table of contents area of operations events affecting operations pipelines finalized new rates at southern natural gas company 
re contracted or contracted available or expiring capacity 
proceeded with several pipeline expansion projects in our pipeline systems and at our elba island lng facility 
incurred significant damage to sections of our gulf coast and offshore pipeline facilities due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
these hurricanes also resulted in the shut in of a significant portion of gas supply on our systems 
e p and marketing and trading completed the turnaround of our exploration and production business by i stabilizing production rates  in spite of incurring a reduction of our annual production of approximately bcfe as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita and ii growing our reserve base through our capital drilling program and through four acquisitions of natural gas and oil properties  including our acquisition of medicine bow 
sold our natural gas and oil production at higher commodity prices 
however  we incurred substantial losses associated with derivative contracts used to provide price protection on our production and in settling hedges that had been put in place during a lower price environment 
assigned or terminated the majority of our power contracts  our cordova tolling agreement and the remaining derivative contracts associated with our power contract restructuring operations 
other completed or announced the divestiture of substantially all of our remaining operations in our midstream  power and other businesses  for total proceeds of approximately billion billion through december  
the net effect of these sales activities resulted in substantial losses in furthered legal and contractual disputes  including those related to our brazilian power plants and domestic legal matters 
what to expect going forward 
for  our pipeline operations are positioned to provide steady operating results based on the current levels of contracted capacity  expansion plans and the status of rate and regulatory actions 
our exploration and production operating results will be driven by continued success of our drilling programs  our ability to restore the remaining production that has been shut in since late september due to hurricane rita  our ability to manage increases in the cost of production services and continued high commodity prices 
additionally  a substantial portion of our below market derivative contracts are scheduled to expire in  which will give us a greater opportunity to participate in the higher commodity pricing environment 
in  we will also strive to achieve our net debt debt  less cash target of billion by year end  complete the sale of our asian and central american power assets substantially all of which are under contract  pursue the divestiture of our remaining domestic power assets and complete the resolution of the issues related to our brazilian power investments as well as other remaining legacy issues 

table of contents liquidity overview 
the year was a turning point for us in terms of our liquidity and capital resources 
we began the year focused on reducing liquidity concerns  strengthening our credit metrics  selling a number of non core assets and businesses and reducing cash flow risks associated with a number of derivative transactions put in place in prior years 
during  we i completed asset sales for proceeds of billion  ii replaced some of our cash margining requirements with letters of credit and iii entered into or completed transactions to divest or reduce the risk of a substantial portion of our power portfolio  including our cordova tolling agreement 
while we continue to closely monitor our liquidity  we believe the events of and those over the past several years have allowed us to turn our attention in to expanding our core businesses of natural gas pipelines and exploration and production 
available liquidity 
we rely on cash generated from our operations as a significant source of liquidity 
we supplement this  as needed  through the use of available credit facilities  project and bank financings  proceeds from asset sales and the issuance of debt  preferred securities and equity securities 
our subsidiaries are a significant source of liquidity to us and they participate in our cash management program to the extent they are permitted under their financing agreements and indentures 
under this program  depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or requirements  we either provide cash to them or they provide cash to us 
we expect that our future funding for working capital needs  capital expenditures  long term debt repayments  dividends and other financing activities will continue to be provided from some or all of these sources 
as of december   we had available liquidity as follows in billions available cash available capacity under our credit agreements net available liquidity at december  see discussion of capital resources on page expected cash flows 
in addition to our available liquidity  we expect to generate significant operating cash flow in  which we will supplement with billion of expected proceeds from asset sales  including billion of cash upon completing the assignment of a majority of our power derivative portfolio 
we expect to also generate cash from financing activities as needed  including the anticipated issuance of common stock during the year 
in  we expect to spend approximately billion on capital investments in our core pipeline and exploration and production businesses  intended to both maintain and grow these businesses 
our capital program for is forecasted as follows in billions exploration and pipelines production total maintenance growth total as of december   we had debt maturities for and of approximately billion and billion 
we also had approximately billion of zero coupon debentures with a stated maturity of that the holders required us to redeem for cash in february in  we have approximately billion of debt that the holders can require us to redeem which  when combined with our maturities  could require us to retire up to billion of debt in factors impacting our liquidity 
each of our existing and future sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us 
for example  cash generated by our business operations may be impacted by  among other things  changes in commodity prices and the extent to which we hedge our natural gas and oil production  demands for our 
table of contents commodities or services  success in recontracting existing pipeline capacity contracts  drilling success and competition from other providers or alternative energy sources 
collateral demands or recovery of cash posted as collateral are impacted by commodity prices  hedging levels and the credit quality of us and our counterparties 
cash generated by future asset sales may depend on the condition and location of the assets  the number of interested buyers and our ability to successfully complete the transaction 
in addition  our future liquidity will be impacted by our ability to access capital markets which may be restricted due to our credit ratings and general market conditions 
the following is a further discussion of some of these factors and their impact on us in or potential impact in future periods 
price risk management activities 
we enter into derivative contracts to provide price protection on a portion of our anticipated natural gas and oil production 
specifically  our exploration and production and marketing and trading segments use swap and option contracts to fix the amount of cash we will receive on contracted volumes sold or to provide floor or ceiling prices on these volumes 
floor prices are the minimum cash prices to be received and ceiling prices are the maximum cash prices to be received under the option contracts 
as of december   a number of our swap contracts have been designated as and are accounted for as accounting hedges 
however  our option contracts and certain other swap contracts have not been designated as hedges and are therefore marked to market through earnings each period 
the accounting method used for these contracts affects the timing of the income or loss recognized on any individual contract in periods prior to its settlement 
however  through the settlement date  the cumulative income or loss and cash flow impacts of a contract are identical whether or not it is accounted for as a hedge or is marked to market through earnings each period 
for a further discussion of the income impacts of these contracts  see our exploration and production and marketing and trading segments discussions of operating results 
the following table shows the contracted volumes and the minimum  maximum and average cash prices that we will ultimately receive under these contracts upon settlement or when the underlying production is sold swaps floors ceilings average average average volumes price volumes price volumes price natural gas oil volumes presented are tbtu for natural gas and mbbl for oil 
prices presented are per mmbtu of natural gas and per bbl of oil 
cash margining requirements on derivative contracts 
a substantial portion of our natural gas and oil derivative contracts are at prices significantly below current market prices  which has resulted in us posting substantial cash margin deposits with the counterparties for the value of these instruments 
during  we experienced volatility in the level of margins posted  primarily resulting from the increase in commodity prices as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the resulting increased commodity prices required us to post billion of additional cash margin deposits with counterparties to our derivative contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  billion of margin deposits had been returned to us due to a decrease in prices and settlements  but these cash recoveries were largely offset by cash collateral requirements relating to an agreement we entered into to assign a majority of the contracts in our power portfolio to a third party 
in  we expect approximately billion of collateral supported by both cash margin deposits and letters of credit  to be returned to us  which includes the collateral that we anticipate to receive upon completion of the assignment of the 
table of contents positions related to our power portfolio in december if commodity prices decrease  we could recover some of this amount earlier than anticipated 
any future increases in prices could have a significant impact on our operating cash flows as additional margin deposits would be required 
based on our derivative positions at december   a mmbtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in an increase in our margin requirements by million for transactions that settle in  million for transactions that settle in  million for transactions that settle in and million for transactions that settle in and thereafter 
hurricanes 
hurricanes katrina and rita impacted virtually all producers and transporters doing business in the gulf of mexico region 
we incurred significant damage to our property  including our transmission facilities 
to date  we estimate total repair costs related to these storms to be approximately million  of which million is claimed through our property damage insurer  which is a mutual insurance company that is subject to individual and aggregate loss limits by event 
based on the level of our claims and the claims of all insured parties  we will not receive a portion of the costs we will incur to repair our systems 
based on current estimates  we anticipate that up to million of capital and maintenance expenditures claimed through our property damage insurer will not be recovered due to these limits 
also  the timing of reimbursements we will receive may occur later than the capital expenditures on the damaged facilities  which may increase our net capital expenditures for and could negatively impact our estimates of cash flow 
despite the impact of the factors above  we were able to largely mitigate the effects of these items in through the successful completion of a number of asset sales  the issuance of million of notes by cig and by entering into a six month  million revolving borrowing base credit agreement with an initial borrowing capacity of million 
we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing liquidity and cash needs through the combination of available cash and borrowings under our credit agreements 
for a further discussion of risks that may impact our cash flows  see discussion on page capital resources existing financing facilities 
during  we continued to reduce our overall debt as part of our strategic plan 
we also issued million of convertible preferred stock primarily to satisfy our remaining obligations under the western energy settlement and to redeem the preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary 
our debt activity during was as follows in millions debt obligations as of december  principal amounts borrowed repayment retirement of principal sale of entities other total debt as of december  related to the sale of cedar brakes i and ii and mohawk river funding ii 
as of december   we have approximately billion of available capacity under several credit facilities as described below billion credit agreement 
as of december   we had borrowed billion as a term loan and issued approximately billion of letters of credit under this credit agreement 
the agreement is collateralized by our equity interests in tgp  epng  anr  cig  southern gas storage company which owns an interest in bear creek storage company and anr storage company 
million revolving credit facility 
in august  our subsidiary  eepc  entered into and borrowed million under a five year revolving credit facility bearing interest at libor plus 
table of contents 
amounts borrowed were used to partially fund the acquisition of medicine bow 
the facility can be utilized for funded borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit and is collateralized by certain eepc natural gas and oil production properties 
our current intent is to issue million to million of our common stock to repay amounts borrowed under this facility and for other purposes  the timing of which is dependent on market conditions 
million revolving credit agreement 
in november  we entered into a million revolving borrowing base credit agreement collateralized by certain natural gas and oil production properties owned by one of our subsidiaries  which is also a co borrower 
under the agreement we have initial borrowing availability of million 
the credit agreement can be used for revolving credit loans or for the issuance of letters of credit and will mature in may as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under this agreement 
the availability of borrowings under these credit agreements and our ability to incur additional debt is subject to various conditions  which we currently meet 
these conditions include compliance with the financial covenants and ratios required by those agreements  absence of default under the agreements and continued accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the agreements 
the financial coverage ratios under our billion credit agreement change over time 
however  these covenants currently require our debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement not to exceed to and our ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense and dividends to be equal to or greater than to  each as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   our ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda was to and our ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense and dividends was to overview of cash flow activities for compared to for the years ended december  and  our cash flows are summarized as follows in billions cash flow from operations continuing operating activities net loss before discontinued operations non cash income items changes in assets and liabilities change in broker margin deposits settlements of derivatives designated as hedges assignment of power derivative liabilities proceeds from entering into derivative contracts changes in other assets and liabilities total cash flow from operations other cash inflows continuing investing activities net proceeds from the sale of assets and investments net proceeds from restricted cash other continuing financing activities net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock net discontinued operations activity total other cash inflows

during  we paid approximately billion of settlements on our hedging derivatives and paid approximately billion to assign or terminate our cordova power contract and our contracts to supply power to cedar brakes i and ii 
in addition  we received approximately billion to assign a portion of our power derivative portfolio to morgan stanley  but were required to deposit billion of cash margin with them related to offsetting contracts we entered into until we complete the assignment 
we expect to receive this cash margin back in the first half of when the original contracts are assigned and the offsetting contracts are terminated 
our cash margining requirements also increased on our other derivative contracts by an additional billion in due to the impact of commodity price increases in the net cash outflows of billion associated with these derivatives and their related cash margin deposits were partially offset by a billion increase in cash flows from our other operating activities  including a billion decrease in the amount of our payments associated with the western energy settlement in as compared to cash from continuing investing activities for the year ended december   net cash used in our continuing investing activities was billion 
among other items  during the year we received net proceeds of approximately billion from sales of our power assets as well as billion from the sales of our general partnership interests in enterprise and various other assets in our field services segment 
our capital expenditures  including acquisitions  were as follows in billions production exploration  development and acquisition expenditures pipeline expansion  maintenance and integrity projects other total capital expenditures and acquisitions 
table of contents cash from continuing financing activities net cash provided by our continuing financing activities was billion for the year ended december  we generated cash of billion primarily from the issuance of billion of convertible preferred stock and billion of long term debt 
we also had billion of cash contributed by our discontinued operations primarily as a result of proceeds from sales of these assets 
offsetting our cash inflows were payments of billion to retire long term third party debt and billion to redeem the cumulative preferred stock of a subsidiary  el paso tennessee pipeline co 
eptp 
additionally  we paid dividends of billion during off balance sheet arrangements in the course of our business activities  we enter into a variety of financing arrangements and contractual obligations 
certain of these arrangements are often referred to as off balance sheet arrangements and include guarantees  letters of credit and other interests in variable interest entities 
guarantees we are involved in various joint ventures and other ownership arrangements that sometimes require additional financial support that results in the issuance of financial and performance guarantees 
in a financial guarantee  we are obligated to make payments if the guaranteed party fails to make payments under  or violates the terms of  the financial arrangement 
in a performance guarantee  we provide assurance that the guaranteed party will execute on the terms of the contract 
if they do not  we are required to perform on their behalf 
for example  if the guaranteed party is required to purchase services from a third party and then fails to do so  we would be required to either purchase these services or make payments to the third party to compensate them for any losses they incurred because of this non performance 
we also periodically provide indemnification arrangements related to assets or businesses we have sold 
these arrangements include  but are not limited to  indemnifications for income taxes  the resolution of existing disputes  environmental matters and necessary expenditures to ensure the safety and integrity of the assets sold 
we record accruals for our guaranty and indemnification arrangements at their fair value when they are issued and subsequently adjust those accruals when we believe it is both probable that we will have to pay amounts under the arrangements and those amounts can be estimated 
as of december   we had a liability of million related to our guarantees and indemnification arrangements 
these arrangements had a total stated exposure of million  for which we are indemnified by third parties for million 
these amounts exclude guarantees for which we have issued related letters of credit discussed below 
in addition to the exposures described above  we received a ruling from a trial court  which was upheld on appeal  that we are required to indemnify a third party for benefits paid to a closed group of retirees of one of our former subsidiaries 
we have a liability of approximately million associated with our estimated exposure under this matter as of december  for a further discussion of this matter  see part ii
