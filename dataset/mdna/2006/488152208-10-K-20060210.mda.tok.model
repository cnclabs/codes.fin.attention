the decrease in the international gross profit rate is due primarily to rate decreases in the united kingdom 
the decrease in gross profit rates experienced in the united kingdom is due  in large part  to a shift in customer mix to larger corporate account customers which tend to have lower gross margins 
many of the company s large corporate and national account customers have negotiated high volume global service agreements  which tend to result in lower gross profit rates than those earned with the company s small and medium size customers 
however  these accounts also have a lower administrative cost due to economies of scale  and can yield an operating margin similar to that realized with small or medium size customers 
the company s strategy is focused on serving and growing large national and local accounts 
as customer mix shifts to larger accounts  the company s average gross margins tend to decrease

critical accounting estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in this process  it is necessary for management to make certain assumptions and related estimates affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the attached notes 
actual results can differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
critical accounting estimates are those that management believes require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and apply percentages to certain aged receivable categories 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowance 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of year end and  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
workers compensation the company has a combination of insurance and self insurance contracts under which the company effectively bears the first  of risk per single accident  except in the state of california  where the company bears the first  of risk per single accident beginning in the company establishes accruals for workers compensation utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the undiscounted future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims  including an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
this process includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
in preparing the estimates  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
management evaluates the accrual  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accrual 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which we made such a determination 
the accrual for workers compensation was million and million at year end and  respectively 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value 
should circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair market value of the reporting unit has fallen below its book value  management must then compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to book value 
if the book value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income 
we completed our impairment tests during the fourth quarter of the and fiscal years and determined that goodwill is not impaired 
this test required comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
different assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in an impairment charge  which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
at year end and  total goodwill amounted to million and million  respectively 

table of contents income taxes income tax expense is based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
judgment is required in determining our income tax expense 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that reported taxable income is fully supportable  we believe that challenges are probable and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of accrual provisions and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
tax laws require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the income tax expense reflected in our financial statements is different than the liability reported in our tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses which are not deductible on our tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction on our tax return  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of tax contingencies 
favorable or unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to our income tax expense in the year of resolution 
our tax accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income and other taxes

these statements are not guarantees of future performance  and the company has no specific intention to update these statements 
actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors

certain risk factors are discussed more fully under risk factors in part i  item a of this filing 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk kelly does not hold or invest in derivative contracts 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries  which conduct business in their local currencies 
these risks are mitigated by the use of the company s multi currency line of credit 
this credit facility is used to borrow in local currencies  which mitigates the exchange rate risk resulting from foreign currency denominated net investments fluctuating in relation to the us dollar 
in addition  the company is exposed to interest rate risks through its use of the multi currency line of credit 
the company is exposed to market risk as a result of its obligation to pay benefits under its nonqualified deferred compensation plan and its related investments in company owned variable universal life insurance policies 
the obligation to employees increases and decreases based on movements in the equity and debt markets 
the investments in publicly traded mutual funds  as part of the company owned variable universal life insurance policies  are designed to mitigate this risk with offsetting gains and losses 
overall  the company s holdings and positions in market risk sensitive instruments do not subject the company to material risk
