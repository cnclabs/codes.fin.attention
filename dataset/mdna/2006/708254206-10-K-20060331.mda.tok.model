item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a non operating holding company whose income is derived from the earnings of our five wholly owned subsidiaries 
we are engaged primarily in the collection  storage  treatment and distribution of potable water for domestic  industrial  commercial and fire protection service in southern and central new hampshire through our three utility subsidiaries pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield 
our water utility revenues constituted of our consolidated revenues in pennichuck water  our principal subsidiary which was established in  accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
pennichuck water s franchise area presently includes the city of nashua  new hampshire and surrounding municipalities 
our water subsidiaries are regulated by the new hampshire public utilities commission new hampshire puc and must obtain new hampshire puc approval to increase their water rates to recover increases in operating expenses and to obtain the opportunity to earn a return on investments in plant and equipment 
new hampshire law provides that utilities are entitled to charge rates which permit them to earn a reasonable return on the cost of the property employed in serving its customers  less accrued depreciation  contributed capital and deferred income taxes rate base 
the cost of capital permanently employed by a utility in its utility business marks the minimum rate of return which a utility is lawfully entitled to earn on its rate base 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the new hampshire puc for inclusion in our water rates  tho ugh there can be no assurance that the new hampshire puc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
the businesses of our two other subsidiaries are non regulated water management services and real estate development and investment 
service corporation provides various non regulated water related monitoring  maintenance  testing and compliance reporting services for water systems for various towns  businesses and residential communities in and around southern and central new hampshire 
its most significant contracts are with the town of hudson  new hampshire and the town of salisbury  massachusetts 
southwood is actively engaged in real estate planning  development and management of residential  commercial  industrial and retail properties 
historically  most of southwood s activities were conducted through real estate joint ventures 
during the past years southwood has participated in four residential joint ventures with john p 
stabile ii  a local developer 
southwood s earnings have from time to time during that period contributed a significant percentage of our consolidated net income 
southwood s contributions from the sale of real estate have increased the fluctuations in our net income during that period 
we expect that southwood will contribute a smaller proportion of our future revenues and earnings

events significantly affecting our earnings during recent years overview 
our earnings during the five year period ended december  were significantly affected by the following events that occurred during one or more years of that period sales of land by southwood  which were especially significant in  and  expenses related to the merger agreement that we entered into in april with aqua america inc formerly known as philadelphia suburban corporation and terminated in february  our actions to oppose ongoing efforts by the city of nashua  new hampshire that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire utility law  and defense and settlement costs related to parallel investigations by the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation the bureau that were conducted primarily in and settled in december southwood real estate related revenues 
our revenues and earnings were positively affected by sales of southwood land during four of the past five years 
the following table sets forth the amount of revenues that we recognized during each year in the to period attributable to those land sales and the percentage that those revenues represented of our total revenues during each of those years 
of southwood consolidated year land sales revenues we expect that southwood s revenues from land sales will constitute a relatively minor percentage of our future consolidated revenues 
terminated merger agreement 
we entered into an agreement in april to be acquired in a merger with aqua america inc in february  before the merger was submitted to our shareholders  we agreed with aqua america to abandon the proposed transaction  because of actions taken by the city of nashua  summarized below  to attempt to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets by eminent domain 
we incurred million and  of merger related expenses that we recognized in and  respectively 
city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding 
the city of nashua s mayor stated his opposition to our proposed merger with aqua america almost immediately after we announced it 
in january  nashua residents approved a referendum authorizing the city to pursue the acquisition of our assets by eminent domain or otherwise 
in march  as part of the eminent domain process  the city filed a petition with the new hampshire puc seeking approval to acquire all of our water utility assets  whether or not related to our nashua service area 
the eminent domain proceeding and potential consequences for us are described elsewhere in this form k report 
we have vigorously opposed the efforts of the city to acquire our assets by eminent domain and intend to continue to do so  although we have publicly stated our desire to work with the city toward a fair and equitable solution 
the new hampshire puc has set a schedule for the eminent domain proceeding which  if not further revised  would result in a hearing on the merits of the city s petition being held in january the staff of the new hampshire puc is scheduled to file testimony on april  addressing  among other things  whether a taking of pennichuck water s assets by eminent domain would be in the public interest 
our eminent domain related expenses in  and were  million and million  respectively 
we expect our eminent domain expenses to be in the range of million 
sec and new hampshire investigations and settlement 
we and our former president and chief executive officer  who resigned in april  were the subject of parallel investigations by the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation the bureau that began in early and late  respectively 
as we previously disclosed  the sec and the bureau alleged that some of our public disclosures regarding various joint venture transactions in the mid to late s were materially false or misleading in several respects  and the bureau contended that we exercised insufficient oversight of southwood s joint ventures  allegedly evidenced by our failing to obtain or to keep adequate records  failing to obtain formal appraisals of the land we contributed to the joint ventures  and failing to consider or investigate real estate development alternatives since the early s 
effective december   the sec and the bureau entered into settlements with the former president and us 
the former president paid the state of new hampshire an administrative fine of  and investigation costs of  in addition  under the terms of the new hampshire settlement our shareholders as of march  received a payment totaling  as of march  the former president was financially responsible for  of that amount and we were responsible for the balance

pennichuck east had not filed for rate relief since our acquisition of the utility 
proposed pennichuck water rate relief filing 
pennichuck water is planning to file a new request for rate relief by mid primarily to recover a portion of its costs incurred for its water treatment plant upgrade project 
we do not expect a final decision on this request until early new bank revolving credit facility 
effective march   we restructured and expanded our debt arrangements with bank of america  increasing our revolving credit facility to million from million 
the bank of america facility permits us to borrow  repay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through december   subject to the terms and conditions of the facility 
the new arrangement replaced one that was scheduled to expire in april other debt financings 
in january  we issued million of long term  fixed rate tax exempt debt  with million representing new funds and the balance utilized to optionally redeem a like amount of higher cost tax exempt debt 
in march  we issued million of year taxable debt to an insurance company pursuant to a private placement transaction 
a portion of the proceeds million represented new funds and the balance million was utilized to fund the maturity of a like amount of higher cost taxable debt 
effective april   we extended the maturity date for our existing million loan from bank of america to the company and pennichuck east  as co borrowers  to december  the loan agreement  as extended  contains covenants substantially similar to the company s new revolving credit facility as described above

acquisitions 
in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire three water systems with approximately  total customers in the lakes region and central part of new hampshire the locke lake water system in barnstead  the birch hill water system in conway and the sunrise estates water system in middleton  new hampshire 
the acquisition is our largest since in january we entered into a settlement agreement with the new hampshire puc staff and the office of consumer advocate on the principal terms of these acquisitions 
on february  the new hampshire puc conducted a public hearing on the settlement agreement 
on march  the new hampshire puc rendered a final written decision enabling us to proceed to close the acquisition in the second quarter of critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
regulatory accounting 
the use of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation stipulates generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator such as the new hampshire puc 
in accordance with sfas  we defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the income statement in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
in the event that the inclusion in the rate making process is disallo wed  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or change in regulatory approval 
we did not defer the costs associated with the terminated merger agreement with aqua america  the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding or the sec and bureau regulatory investigations and settlements 
revenue recognition 
the revenues of our water utility subsidiaries are based on authorized rates approved by the new hampshire puc 
estimates of water utility revenues for water delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
we read our residential customer meters generally on a quarterly basis and record revenues based on meter reading results 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage patterns and the effective water rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
our non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when water is delivered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
our pension and other postretirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we revised the discount rate effective at december  to from in to reflect market conditions 
in determining pension obligation and expense amounts  this and other assumptions may change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
further  the value of our pension plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  were adversely affected by significant declines in the financial markets from through  which more than offset positive investment performance during through fluctuations in market returns may result in increased or decreased pension expense in future periods 
these conditions impacted the funded status of our pension plan at both december  and  and therefore  will also impact pension expense f or our pension plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of although we are not required to make contributions to the plan  we anticipate that we will contribute approximately  to the plan within its plan year 
results of operations general in this section  we discuss our  and results of operations and the factors affecting them 
our operating activities  as discussed in greater detail in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  are grouped into three primary business segments as follows water utility operations  water management services  and real estate development and investment 
our consolidated revenues tend to be significantly affected by weather conditions experienced throughout the year and in past years have been significantly affected by sales of major real estate parcels which occurred from time to time 
water revenues are typically at their lowest point during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
water revenues in the second and third quarters tend to be greater because of increased water consumption for non essential usage by our customers during the late spring and summer months 
results of operations compared to overview 
for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was  compared to net income of million in on a per share basis  basic income per share for was 
as compared to 
per share for the results of operations for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by a significant increase in legal  consulting and other costs relating to the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain efforts 
our eminent domain related expenses  net of taxes  were approximately million  or 
per share in  compared to  or 
per share in excluding the effect of the eminent domain expenses in and  our consolidated net income was million  or 
per share and million  or 
per share  respectively 
we believe that a presentation of net income excluding these expenses is useful to investors because it is indicative of our financial performance in the ordinary course of business 
we use net income excluding these expenses to evaluate our financial performance because we expect that the financial impact of these expenses has become or  in the relatively near term  will become insignificant 
we expect that the financial impact of expenses related to the eminent domain proceeding will cease within the next two to three years 
the material limitation associated with using this measure is that it does not include all of the expenses required to be included by generally accepted accounting principles 
we compensate for this limitation when using this measure by comparing it directly to net income calculated according to generally accepted accounting p rinciples 
our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the combined revenues of the company s three utilities increased to million  or an increase of from the utilities combined operating income increased to million in  a increase over the increase in the company s combined revenues was primarily attributable to the following a permanent rate increase approved by the new hampshire puc of implemented by pennichuck water in april for service rendered on and after june   a temporary rate increase of approved by the new hampshire puc and implemented by pennichuck east in september  and a increase in the combined utility customer base for the year

our water utility operations include the activities of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield  each of which is regulated by the new hampshire puc 
on a combined basis  net income of our three utilities in calendar year was approximately million  an increase of  from principally due to the rate relief received by two of the utility subsidiaries from the new hampshire puc in as well as modest growth in our utility customer base as discussed below

that rate case was concluded in december  and in january the new hampshire puc granted an increase of  representing additional annual revenues of approximately  this rate relief was effective for water bills rendered on and after january  the positive effect of this rate relief was partially offset by lower consumption due to a wetter than normal summer 
on may   pennichuck water filed a petition for rate relief with the new hampshire puc seeking an overall increase in its rates which would have resulted in approximately million of additional annual revenues 
on september   the new hampshire puc granted pennichuck water temporary rate relief of  or approximately million in annual water revenues  effective for service rendered on or after june  in march  we reached a settlement with the new hampshire puc staff on our requested rate relief for pennichuck water that we filed in may the rate case was concluded in april and in may the new hampshire puc granted an increase of representing additional revenues of approximately million

these increased costs are expected to be embedded in our utilities future cost of providing water service 
as such  our utilities will continue to seek future rate relief to recover these increasing costs

for the year ended december   southwood s revenues were  compared to million in in the table below  we show the major components of southwood s revenues during and land sales folsom property westwood park llc other income loss from unconsolidated equity investments total the decrease in our real estate revenues resulted principally from the sale of an approximately acre parcel of unimproved land located in merrimack  new hampshire in in january  southwood sold this land to the folsom development corporation for approximately million 
under the terms of that sale  southwood received approximately  in cash and a long term note receivable of million

at december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies  as discussed in greater detail under off balance sheet arrangements and also under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining ownership interest in each joint venture is held primarily by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer  with whom southwood has also participated in four residential joint ventures during the past years 
southwood uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in the joint ventures 
consequently  southwood s investment is adjusted for its share of earnings or losses and for any distributions received from the joint venture 
for the year ended december   southwood s share of pre tax earnings and distributions from these joint ventures was approximately  and  respectively  compared to pre tax earnings of  and n o distributions for the decline in the joint ventures pre tax earnings resulted primarily from several tenant vacancies in the hecop i and hecop iii buildings

this decrease was primarily attributable to intercompany charges due to a change in the methodology that we use to allocate to southwood corporation the cost of the resources provided by the company and pennichuck water 
this decrease was offset in part by an increase in salaries and benefits in southwood s operating expenses of approximately  consisted primarily of  in salaries and benefits in   for general and administrative costs and  in allocated intercompany charges due to additional company resources utilized for the planning and development of our existing land portfolio 
eminent domain related expenses 
our costs incurred in defending against the city of nashua s eminent domain proceeding increased significantly in to million from million in the increase was primarily attributable to expenses incurred for legal and valuation expert advisory services as well as a significant public information campaign opposing the city s efforts and in litigating several cases with the city in state and federal courts

for the year ended december   southwood s revenues were million compared to  in in the table below  we show the major components of southwood s revenues during and land sales folsom property westwood park llc other income from unconsolidated equity investments total the increase in our real estate revenues resulted principally from the sale of an approximately acre parcel of unimproved land located in merrimack  new hampshire 
in january  southwood sold this land to the folsom development corporation for approximately million 
under the terms of that sale  southwood received approximately  in cash and a long term note receivable of million 
the note  which was set to mature in october  carried a floating interest rate of prime plus and was secured by a first mortgage on the property 
the note was fully paid during the fourth quarter of  resulting in recognition of the remaining gain of million in accordance with the requirements established under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
at december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies  as discussed in greater detail under off balance sheet arrangements and also under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining ownership interest in each joint venture is held primarily by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer  with whom southwood has also participated in four residential joint ventures during the past years 
southwood uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in the joint ventures 
consequently  southwood s investment is adjusted for its share of earnings or losses and for any distributions received from the joint venture 
for the year ended december   southwood s share of pre tax earnings and distributions from these joint ventures was approximately  and  respectively  compared to pre tax earnings of  and distri butions of  for the decline in the joint ventures pre tax earnings resulted primarily from several tenant vacancies in the hecop i and hecop iii buildings 
southwood s share of pre tax earnings is included under net earnings loss from investments accounted for under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
southwood also has a ownership in westwood park llc  a consolidated joint venture formed in to develop a tract of land in northwest nashua 
during  westwood received  representing escrowed funds from a land sale which occurred in expenses associated with our real estate operations were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased professional fees associated with an increased emphasis on management and development of our real estate portfolio during southwood s operating expenses of approximately  consisted primarily of  of property taxes associated with its remaining landholdings   for general and administrative costs and  in allocated intercompany charges due to additional company resources utilized for the planning and development of our existing land portfolio 
eminent domain related expenses 
our costs incurred in defending against the city of nashua s eminent domain proceeding increased significantly in to million from  in the increase was primarily attributable to expenses incurred in a significant public information campaign opposing the city s efforts and to costs incurred in litigating several cases with the city in state and federal courts 
merger and other expenses 
expenses attributable to the terminated merger agreement with aqua america and the sec and bureau investigations and settlement declined significantly in compared to we had no merger expenses in compared to  in  when we terminated the merger agreement with aqua america 
our expenses and settlement costs relating to the sec and bureau investigations decreased to  in compared to  in our settlement with the sec and bureau that was effective in december required a payment made on march  of  to our shareholders as of march  our former president was financially responsible for  of that amount  and we were responsible for the balance 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   our consolidated interest expense was approximately million which was not a material change from interest expense in both years primarily represents interest on long term indebtedness of the company and our three regulated water utilities as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of funds are cash flow from utility operations  cash proceeds from the sale of portions of our real estate holdings  borrowings pursuant to our bank revolving credit facility and proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
our primary uses of funds are capital expenditures associated with our continuous utility construction program  dividends on our common stock payable as and when declared by our board of directors and repayments of principal on our outstanding debt obligations  whether pursuant to scheduled sinking fund payments or final maturities 
for the past several years  cash flows from operations have fluctuated largely based on four factors i weather  ii amount and timing of rate increases  iii gain recognized on the sale of southwood land as described above  and iv significant costs associated with the proposed merger with aqua america that terminated in  costs related to the sec and bureau regulatory investigations that were settled in december  and the costs associated with the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding  each discussed in more detail above 
for the period to  the majority of our funds were provided through a combination of cash flow from utility operations and sales of portions of our real estate holdings 
we supplemented these sources of funds beginning in the fourth quarter of and throughout by drawing down a portion of the funds available under our bank revolving credit facility 
during  in addition to cash flow from operations we realized a substantial amount of net new proceeds from the sale of various debt securities totaling million and from a public offering of common stock totaling million 
we also generated approximately  during through the issuance of new shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan 
to capital expenditures program 
we expect our capital expenditures to increase substantially during the into early period  as discussed elsewhere in this form k report 
see risk factors and our business 
the following table summarizes our expected capital expenditures and other funds requirements for the to period 
utility plant additions other total utility plant additions other total our water utilities are capital intensive businesses 
we are engaged in continuous construction programs at our utility subsidiaries primarily for water distribution system repair  rehabilitation and replacement  water storage facility maintenance and additions  and more recently  water supply security 
for the period to  capital expenditures for water distribution  storage  and supply totaled million  or approximately million per year 
for and the period to  comparable expenditures are expected to total million and million in current dollars  respectively  or approximately million per year 
in addition to our recurring programs  we are embarking on two major new construction initiatives 
the first is an upgrade of our water treatment plant that is necessary in order for the plant to meet more stringent  federally mandated safe drinking water standards 
the water treatment plant project construction commenced in the second half of and is expected to be completed by the spring of capital expenditures associated with the water treatment plant upgrade project are expected to total approximately million for and million for to the second is the installation of a radio meter reading rmr system 
the rmr system will enable a switch from quarterly to monthly billing and will facilitate the introduction of conservation based pricing during periods of extremely heavy consumption the summer months 
we will complete a one year pilot of the rmr system in  residential customer premises by the fall of with a full system roll out  based upon the success of the pilot  scheduled for  and capital expenditures for the rmr system are expected to be  in and million for to in addition to the upgrade of our water treatment plant and the installation of the rmr system  we expect to incur other capital expenditures aggregating million in and million for to also  the amounts shown as other in the table above reflect expenditures for potential acquisitions of small regional regulated water utility systems  consistent with our record of prior acquisitions  and potential real estate related acquisitions by southwood 
external financing requirements 
due to the significant size of our utility construction program in as described above  we expect that only to of our funding requirements will be provided by cash flow from our operations after payment of dividends on common stock 
we expect that the balance of our funding will be obtained through long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
our timing and mix of future debt and equity financing is subject to a number of factors including  but not limited to i debt and equity market conditions  ii the need to maintain a balanced capital structure in order to preserve financial flexibility and to manage the overall cost of capital  and iii certain debt issuance covenants as contained in our outstanding loan agreements 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete all or any of the future debt and equity financings described below or to compl ete them on a timely basis 
the receipt of timely and adequate rate relief will also be critically important in providing us cash flow from operations and the ability to access credit and permanent capital  both debt and equity  at reasonable costs and terms 
we are unable  however  to predict the outcome of our future rate relief filings 
recent and contemplated long term debt and equity arrangements 
in january  we issued million of long term  fixed rate tax exempt debt  with million representing new funds and the balance utilized to optionally redeem a like amount of higher cost tax exempt debt 
in march  we issued million of year taxable debt to an insurance company pursuant to a private placement transaction 
a portion of the proceeds million represented new funds and the balance million was utilized to fund the maturity of a like amount of higher cost taxable debt 
effective march   we restructured and expanded our debt arrangements with bank of america  increasing our revolving credit facility to million from million 
the bank of america facility permits us to borrow  repay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through december   subject to the terms and conditions of the facility 
the new arrangement replaced one that was scheduled to expire in april effective april   we extended the maturity date for our existing million loan from bank of america to the company and pennichuck east  as co borrowers  to december  the loan agreement  as extended  contains covenants substantially similar to the company s new revolving credit facility as described above 
we also entered into an interest rate swap transaction of same tenor with bank of america effectively converting the loan to a fixed rate 
in july we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock 
we issued a total of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds  estimated at million  will be utilized primarily to fund utility capital expenditures 
pending such use  net proceeds were utilized  in part  to repay about million of outstanding balances under the company s revolving credit facility 
the balance was  and continues to be  invested in short term  money market securities 
on october   pennichuck water issued an aggregate of  of long term tax exempt bonds through the business finance authority the authority of the state of new hampshire  consisting of three separate series of bonds a through c with coupon rates ranging from to and a maturity date of october  on the date of issuance of the bonds  the authority loaned the proceeds of the series a bonds totaling  to pennichuck water to finance upgrades to its water facilities 
the proceeds of the series b and the series c bonds totaling  and  respectively  were deposited in escrow on the date of issuance which  upon request by pennichuck water on october  and october   respectively or such other dates as pennichuck water may request  the proceeds of the series b bonds or the series c bonds  as applicable  will be loaned to pennichuck water to finance the project 
we also have access  from time to time  to low cost long term debt from two sources 
first  we have applied and will continue to apply for long term debt funds directly from the state of new hampshire under the state s revolving fund program srf 
funds provided under the srf loans carry long term fixed costs at interest rates set with reference to various municipal bond indices  which rates are generally below the rates for comparable us treasury securities of like maturity 
as of december   we had three outstanding srf loans aggregating approximately  during we expect total draw downs on our fourth srf loan  which had a document closing in may  of about  we have commenced documentation for our fifth srf loan  a proposed million commitment to fund a portion of contract for our water treatment plant upgrade project 
we expect to have a document closing on our fifth srf loan in the second quarter o f and to begin draw downs later in our other source of low cost  long term debt is tax exempt debt issued on our behalf by the new hampshire bond finance authority bfa 
the bfa acts solely as a passive conduit to the tax exempt bond markets with us acting as the obligor for the associated tax exempt debt 
at december  we had seven outstanding bfa or its predecessor entity issues aggregating million including million representing a portion of the million offering conducted in october the remaining million was placed in escrow for the sole benefit of bondholders with no recourse to us and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
we expect to draw these funds as we incur capital expenditures for various water facilities projects  primarily the water treatment plant upgrade project  and record the associated debt as a long term liability over the time frame 
significant financial covenants 
our new revolving credit facility contains three financial maintenance tests which must be met on a quarterly basis 
these maintenance tests are as follows our fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed x  our tangible net worth must exceed million  and our funded debt must not exceed of our total capitalization 
also  various pennichuck water and pennichuck east loan agreements contain tests that govern the issuance of additional indebtedness 
these issuance tests are as follows to issue short term debt  our total debt must not exceed of our total capital unless the new short term debt is subordinated to existing debt  to issue long term debt  our funded debt must not exceed of our property additions  and to issue long term debt  our earnings available for interest divided by our interest expense must exceed x except for pennichuck water s series bond for which the test is x 
certain covenants in pennichuck water s and pennichuck east s loan agreements as well as our bank of america revolving credit loan agreement effectively restrict our ability to upstream common dividends from pennichuck water and pennichuck east as well as to pay common dividends to our shareholders 
several of pennichuck water s loan agreements contain a covenant that requires pennichuck water to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
at december   pennichuck water s net worth was million 
one of pennichuck east s loan agreements contains a covenant that requires pennichuck east to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
at december   pennichuck east s net worth was million 
our bank of america revolving credit loan agreement contains a covenant that requires we maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of million 
at december   our consolidated net worth was million 
we are in active discussions with bank of america to amend the agreement to lower the minimum consolidated net worth requirement 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these and other debt covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies 
the remaining ownership interest in each of the joint ventures is primarily held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer with whom southwood has also participated in four other residential joint ventures during the past ten years 
the formation of these joint ventures provides southwood with an opportunity to develop its landholdings in such a manner as to provide for a long term income stream through commercial rental activities 
additionally  the joint ventures  as legal entities  mitigate the financial risk associated with sole ownership of developed commercial properties by southwood 
the joint ventures  whose assets and liabilities are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  own certain commercial office buildings on which there are outstanding mortgage notes totaling mill ion and million as of december  and  respectively 
the mortgage notes are each secured by the underlying property 
in addition  southwood is contingently liable on one half of the outstanding balances of two of the three outstanding mortgages  and as such  it has issued a guarantee to the mortgagee for its share of the guaranteed indebtedness 
at december   southwood was contingently liable on approximately million of mortgage indebtedness associated with the limited liability companies 
in addition  if either hecop ii or hecop iii defaults on its indebtedness  southwood s investment in the other hecop will be at risk  because each of hecop ii and hecop iii has guaranteed the indebtedness of the other 
southwood s investments in hecop i iii had an aggregate carrying value of  as of december  distributions from the joint ventures have from time to time during the past ten years been a significant source of funds to support our dividend payments to shareholders 
we account for southwood s investment in the four current joint ventures using the equity method of accounting  meaning that we recognize on a current basis of each joint venture s operating results 
those results reflect ongoing carrying costs such as maintenance and property taxes 
information about our revenues  expenses and cash flows arising from the joint ventures is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  we completed a tax exempt debt financing with the new hampshire bond finance authority bfa 
the bfa acts solely as a passive conduit to the tax exempt bond markets with us acting as the obligor for the associated tax exempt debt 
at december  we had borrowed million representing a portion of the million offering conducted in october the remaining million was placed in escrow for the sole benefit of bondholders with no recourse to us and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
we expect to draw these funds as we incur capital expenditures for various water facilities projects  primarily the water treatment plant upgrade project  and record the associated debt as a long term liability over the time frame 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of december   and the periods in which payments are due  adjusted for the implementation of our expanded and restructured credit facility with bank of america described above less than total year to years to years after years long term debt operating leases pension and retiree medical costs purchase obligations total pension and retiree medical costs cannot be reasonably estimated beyond and may be impacted by such factors as return on pension assets  changes in the number of plan participants and future salary increases 
pennichuck water has a wholesale water agreement the agreement with manchester nh water works mww to purchase water from mww through six metering points for various community water systems owned by pennichuck water and pennichuck east 
the agreement  amended in february  has a year term and provides for an average daily flow to pennichuck water and pennichuck east of up to million gallons per day mgd with a maximum daily flow rate of mgd 
pennichuck water and pennichuck east purchase water at a rate established by mww for all of its non manchester customers 
the current rate  effective january   is per one hundred cubic feet ccf in areas where fire protection is not provided by mww and per ccf where fire protection is provided 
the agreement requires that pennichuck water and pennichuck east pay a one time source development charge sdc of for each gallon of the million gallons of the average daily flow 
to date  pennichuck water and pennichuck east had achieved a combined peak average daily flow of  gallons 
the sdc is re calculated annually to reflect any increases in average daily flow and  if the flow is increased  pennichuck water and pennichuck east pay the sdc for the incremental demand 
any incremental sdc is payable in january of each year 
sdc payments began in and as of december   the total sdc paid to mww was  which allows pennichuck water to draw an average daily flow of up to  the incremental sdc paid in and was  and  respectively 
there was no sdc due in january since the average daily flow in was less than the previous high average usage level established in any future payments to mww would be subject to an increase in average daily flow 
no future obligations under this contract are disclosed since such future payments are based on future water consumption levels that are affected by weather conditions and customer gr owth 
in april  pennichuck water entered into a long term lease arrangement with hecop iii  llc for approximately  square feet of office space located in merrimack  new hampshire which serves as our headquarters 
southwood holds a ownership interest in hecop iii  llc and the remaining ownership interests are held by john p 
stabile ii  who is also the holder of ownership interests in three other llc joint ventures with southwood as discussed above 
pension plan 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees 
the accounting for this plan under fasb  employer s accounting for pensions  requires that we use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the discount rate applied to the projected benefit obligation  ii the long term rate of return on plan assets and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of our pension obligations and our annual pension expense 
a range of discount rates is established and periodically modified by the internal revenue service to calculate a pension plan s current benefit obligation for purposes of the full funding limits imposed on such plans 
after consultation with the actuary for the pension plan  we reduced our discount rate from to effective at december  our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on the plan s expected asset allocation  expected returns on various classes of plan assets as well as historical returns 
we assumed that our long term rate of return on pension plan assets was in and in and in addition  we assumed an increase in participant compensation levels of in both and and in these key assumptions are reviewed annually with our actuary and investment advisor and are updated to reflect the plan s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from our actuarial assumptions because of economic and other conditions which may impact the amount of pension expense we recognize 
at december   we had a minimum pension liability of approximately  representing the excess of our pension liabilities over our plan assets 
for  the discount rate used to value pension benefit obligations was compared to for and our accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the market value of our plan assets by approximately million at december  we recorded an adjustment of approximately  which resulted in a minimum pension liability of approximately million at the end of and a credit  net of taxes  of approximately  to other comprehensive income 
future adjustments to other comprehensive income will be affected by changes in realized returns on pension plan assets  contributions to pension assets by us and changes in discount rates 
dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
we offer a dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase program that is available to our shareholders  employees and customers 
under this program  our shareholders may reinvest all or a portion of their common stock dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
we also accept optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at of the prevailing market prices 
this program has provided us with additional common equity of  in and  in no additional common equity was provided with respect to this program during environmental matters 
our water utility subsidiaries are subject to the water quality regulations set forth by the epa and the new hampshire department of environmental services des 
the epa is required to periodically set new maximum contaminant levels for certain chemicals as required by the federal safe drinking water act sdwa 
the quality of our treated water currently meets or is better than all standards set by the epa and the des 
however  increased monitoring and reporting standards have led to additional operating costs for us 
any additional monitoring and testing costs arising from future epa and des mandates should eventually be recovered through water rates in our utilities future rate filings 
pennichuck water s filtration plant in nashua is impacted by the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule  which established a new turbidity standard of nephelometric turbidity units or ntu 
turbidity is a measure of sediment or foreign particles that are suspended in the water 
pennichuck has committed approximately  in its capital budget to complete all the design phases required for this project 
an additional million has been allocated in its budget to continue with the construction of required improvements 
as discussed earlier  pennichuck water estimates the total cost to comply with this new standard to be approximately million 
the total cost includes all construction and engineering associated costs necessary to complete the required treatment plant upgrades from the project initiation in to its completion in the spring of  although such estimates are subject to any future changes in th e rule and changes in design and construction that may be required 
five of pennichuck water s small community water systems including two new systems acquired in have wells that produce water with arsenic levels in excess of the new standard of parts per billion which became effective in february pennichuck water has installed arsenic treatment systems at these locations  however  the expenditures necessary to comply with this standard are not expected to be a material part of our future capital expenditure program 
pennichuck water s remaining community water systems have wells that produce water meeting the new arsenic standard 
we learned in june that one of the two wells that provide water to one of pennichuck water s small community water systems produces water with uranium levels in excess of the epa standard that became effective in december this water system provides water to less than customers 
pennichuck water s remaining community water systems have wells that produce water meeting the uranium standard 
uranium occurs naturally in groundwater in areas in our region where granite bedrock is prevalent 
consequently  regulators expect that to wells in each of new hampshire  maine and vermont will have uranium levels that exceed the epa standard of parts per billion 
in order to comply with the epa uranium standard  pennichuck water installed a uranium filtration treatment system at the affected location 
pending installation of the treatment system  pennichuck water shut off the well that produces water with excess uranium levels 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the new hampshire puc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the new hampshire puc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r also eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
in april  the securities and exchange commission issued a rule that amends the implementation dates for sfas r 
the new rule calls for the implementation of sfas r at the beginning of the first quarter of  instead of the t hird quarter of the company has assessed the impact that sfas r will have on its consolidated financial statements which are expected to be similar to the pro forma disclosures included in note q to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even if uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
the company has adopted this standard as required in the company has evaluated the provisions of this statement and has determined that no additional asset retirement obligations exist as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information regarding market risk of the company and our subsidiaries is presented in note debt and note fair value of financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
our exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our revolving credit facility which contains variable interest rates 
this facility  which includes a total borrowing capacity of million  permits us to borrow  repay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through december  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus based on the results of various financial ratios 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  we also have a million variable interest rate loan with a bank 
the loan  which was originally scheduled to mature in april  was extended to december  in april  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank that also has a maturity date of december  the purpose of this swap agreement is to mitigate interest rate risks associated with our million floating rate loan 
the agreement provides for the exchange of fixed interest rate payments for floating interest rate payment obligations on notional amounts of principal totaling million 
the floating rate loan with the bank contains interest rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus based on the results of various financial ratios 
the applicable margin at december  was resulting in an interest rate of 
we designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge against the variable future cash flows associate d with the interest payments due on the million of notes 
the combined effect of its libor based borrowing formula and the swap produces an all in fixed borrowing cost equal to 
the fair market value of our interest rate swaps represents the estimated unrealized loss to terminate these agreements based upon current interest rates
