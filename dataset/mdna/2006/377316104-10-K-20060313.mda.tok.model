there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  therefore  the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
the management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units 
methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change 
costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services 
management evaluates business unit results before non cash pension income  restructuring related charges  unusual items  effects of asset dispositions and insurance recoveries because it believes this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core papermaking businesses and the profitability of business units 
this presentation is closely aligned with the management and operating structure of our company
