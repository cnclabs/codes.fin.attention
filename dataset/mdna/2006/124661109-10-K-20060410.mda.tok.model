item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands  except per share amounts and per pound lead amounts 
overview during fiscal year  major items that impacted our financial results include i non cash pre tax intangible assets  goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges totaling  related to our power electronics division and non cash fixed asset impairment charges of  related to our motive power division  ii the increased cost of lead  which had a significant negative impact on the results of our standby power and motive power divisions  and iii the acquisitions and associated financial results of celab  datel and cps  which are included in the results of operations of the power electronics division for the entire year 
impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal year  our standby power division experienced higher demand for products sold to the telecommunication markets  while demand for our standby power products sold into the ups markets softened 
demand for our motive power products declined slightly while demand increased in the power electronics division  after adjusting for prior year acquisitions 
raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of our industrial batteries and electronics products and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of our materials costs 
during fiscal years  and  the average london metals exchange lme price per pound of lead was as follows fiscal average annual lme price per pound of lead lowest average monthly lme price per pound of lead highest average monthly lme price per pound of lead lead represented approximately of our consolidated cost of sales for the fiscal year lead traded as high as per pound on february  the increase in lead market price has negatively impacted our financial results in recent periods 
we historically have not been able to fully offset the effects of higher costs of raw materials through price increases to customers or by way of productivity improvements 
we estimate that a variation of per pound of lead changes materials costs by approximately  for our standby power and motive power divisions 
inflation the cost to c d of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
all of our raw materials prices  including lead  steel  copper and resins  as well as fuel costs  continued to rise in fiscal year  and we generally have not been able to fully offset these higher prices through selective price increases 
we believe that  over recent years  we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases on most items other than lead by o effective raw materials purchasing programs  o increases in labor productivity  o improvements in overall manufacturing efficiencies  and o selective price increases of our products 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in c d s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses identifiable intangible asset impairment goodwill impairment operating loss income interest expense  net other expense  net loss income before income taxes and minority interest provision benefit for income taxes net loss income before minority interest minority interest net loss income reclassified for comparative purposes 
critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition c d recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of the agreement  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
accruals are made for sales returns and other allowances based on our experience 
while returns have historically been minimal and within the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
allowance for doubtful accounts c d maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventory reserves c d adjusts the value of its obsolete and unmarketable inventory to the estimated market value based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analyses 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are not amortized and are subject to the impairment rules of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances or events 
c d determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of financial projections and discounted cash flow techniques adjusted for risk characteristics  also giving consideration to c d s overall market capitalization 
the fair market value of the reporting units is compared to the carrying value of the reporting units to determine if an impairment loss should be calculated 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is indicated 
the loss is calculated by comparing the fair value of the goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
if the book value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded 
fair value of goodwill is determined by subtracting the fair value of the identifiable assets of a reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
deferred tax valuation allowance c d records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event c d was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that c d would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
warranty reserves c d provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers products and processes  c d s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  warranty replacement costs and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  warranty replacement costs or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be made 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be required 
litigation and environmental reserves c d is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
we also expend funds for environmental remediation of both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  we record a loss and establish a reserve for litigation or remediation when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability exists and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demands or settlements that have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  estimates performed by independent engineering companies and outside counsel  available facts  existing and proposed technology  the identification of other prps  their ability to contribute and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
however  the reserves may materially differ from ultimate actual liabilities if the loss contingency is difficult to estimate or if management s judgments turn out to be inaccurate 
if management believes no best estimate exists  the minimum loss is accrued 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs consist of direct and indirect internal costs related to specific projects 
the cost of materials whether from our normal inventory or acquired specially for research and development activities and equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise are capitalized as tangible assets when acquired or constructed 
the cost of such materials consumed in research and development activities and the depreciation of such equipment or facilities used in those activities are recorded as research and development costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal all comparisons are with the corresponding periods in the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
net sales for fiscal year increased  or to  from  in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the acquisitions of celab  datel and cps  for which a full year of sales was recorded in fiscal year sales of the power electronics division increased  or  primarily due to the acquisitions 
in the prior fiscal year  c d owned celab for eight months  datel for seven months and cps for four months 
sales by the standby power division increased  or  primarily due to increased sales in the telecom market  partially offset by lower sales to the ups market

gross profit in the power electronics division increased  primarily due to the results of the prior year acquisitions  partially offset by the current year charges for fixed asset impairments 
gross profit in the standby power and motive power divisions increased  and  respectively 
these variances are due primarily to the fixed asset impairments and environmental clean up charges incurred in the prior year  coupled with the re evaluation of those environmental clean up charges in the current year 
the benefit of these prior year charges was partially offset by an increase in the cost of lead of approximately  and fixed asset impairments in the motive power division 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased  or 
this increase was primarily due to increased selling and general and administrative expenses of  due to the acquisitions  increased severance and related costs of  higher sarbanes oxley compliance costs of  principally attributable to the company s fiscal acquisitions  and higher warranty expenses of  in the standby and motive power divisions 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased  or 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from during fiscal year to during fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the celab  datel and cps acquisitions 
during the third quarter of the year  the company conducted impairment tests of its goodwill and intangible assets  due to the existence of recurring realized and anticipated operating results below forecasted results in the power electronics division 
as a result of the impairment test performed during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded charges to expense for impairments of intangible assets and goodwill of  and  respectively 
the prior impairment test was the result of our annual assessment conducted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of  and an intangible asset impairment charge of operating loss for fiscal year decreased  or to an operating loss of  from an operating loss of  in fiscal year below is a summary of key items affecting operating loss income for fiscal year analysis of change in operating loss income standby power motive power electronics power fiscal year vs

income tax expense of  was recorded in fiscal year  compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal year the increase income tax expense in fiscal year is primarily due to the following items o the valuation allowance related to domestic  state and foreign deferred tax assets increased by an additional  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  o the  write off of deferred tax assets related to c d s investment in several foreign subsidiaries  o the reduction of  in the tax benefit related to foreign tax credits taken in prior years due to the current year domestic net operating loss  o an increase in tax expense of  due to a combination of domestic losses for which no tax benefit is recorded and tax expense in certain profitable foreign jurisdictions  along with the lack of foreign tax credits related to current year repatriated earnings due to the domestic net operating loss  and o an increase of  in tax expense due to the lower pre tax book loss in fiscal year these items are partially offset by a  decrease in the tax effect of the impairments of goodwill and intangible assets in certain jurisdictions 
minority interest reflects the ownership interest in the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china  that is not owned by c d 
in the current year  the joint venture had minority interest of at the shanghai facility compared to a minority interest of in fiscal year as a result of all of the above  a net loss was recorded of  compared to a net loss of  in the prior year 
on a per share basis  net loss was compared to a net loss of basic and fully diluted for fiscal years and  respectively 
other comprehensive loss other comprehensive loss increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to the recording of a minimum pension liability adjustment of  partially offset by an unrealized gain on derivative instruments of  related to lead hedges 
fiscal compared to fiscal all comparisons are with the corresponding periods in the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
three acquisitions occurred during fiscal year on may   we acquired celab  based in hampshire  united kingdom  a provider of power conversion products  predominately sold into military  catv and telecommunications applications in europe 
on june   we acquired datel  a mansfield  massachusetts based manufacturer of dc to dc converters  data acquisition components and digital meters

cps develops dc to dc converters and ac to dc power supplies which are sold on a direct basis to large computing and communications oems 
for reporting purposes  these three acquisitions are part of the power electronics division 
net sales for fiscal year increased  or to  from  in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the aforementioned acquisitions coupled with improved customer demand for products of all three divisions 
sales of the power electronics division increased  primarily due to net sales of  recorded by the entities acquired during the year  coupled with higher sales by the legacy portion of the power electronics division  which increased by  or  primarily due to higher dc to dc converter sales 
sales by the standby power division increased  or  primarily due to increased sales to the ups market  partially offset by continued weakness in the telecommunications market 
motive power divisional sales increased  or  primarily due to higher battery and charger sales 
gross profit for fiscal year declined  or to  from  with margins decreasing from to

the effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects a benefit of compared to a provision of in the prior year 
the benefit recorded in fiscal year was adjusted from the statutory rate to reflect the tax effect of the goodwill impairment  an increase to the valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits for the unremitted earnings of a controlled foreign subsidiary  and the impact of non deductible acquired in process research and development assets related to the datel acquisition 
minority interest reflects the ownership interest in the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china  that is not owned by c d

future outlook the company considers the following  among other matters  to be key elements of focus for its underlying business plans and strategies for fiscal year any failures in effectively implementing these strategies and actions would impact our performance and results of operations 
lead and commodity costs and pricing in response to continually increasing raw materials prices  particularly lead  the company announced a general price increase for its standby and motive power products effective march  we expect higher raw materials costs  particularly lead  to continue to put pressure on our results of operations in the near term 
higher lead prices negatively affected operating results in fiscal year by approximately  compared to the prior year 
manufacturing moves construction of a new manufacturing facility has commenced with our joint venture in china  due to the required relocation of our shanghai facility 
we expect production will begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the joint venture received  from the chinese government as a partial payment for the shanghai facility 
upon return of the existing property to the chinese government by january  the chinese government will pay the joint venture an additional  on april  we announced changes to our contract manufacturing arrangements for our power electronics business involving the termination of existing manufacturing agreements with celestica 
wind down of these operations and transfer to other manufacturers is scheduled to be completed by september these changes are expected to drive our ability to meet customer needs and improve our cost structure 
on april  we announced further actions associated with the revitalization of our motive power products business 
these actions include launching new products to open access to several unaddressed markets  the planned closure of our huguenot  new york facility and relocation of production to reynosa  mexico and the establishment of new distribution centers to service our customer base 
these manufacturing moves all require significant inventory builds during transition relocation to other operations which is expected to adversely impact our working capital requirements  principally during the second and third quarters of fiscal year we expect these inventory builds to be temporary in nature with a return to historical working capital levels by the end of fiscal year cost management  quality and six sigma the company is expanding its efforts to reduce costs and improve customer service and satisfaction through enhanced quality and delivery focus and goals 
these strategies are being supported by lean supply chain initiatives and six sigma methodologies and tools 
the completion of the integration of the fiscal year power electronics acquisitions also continues  with an emphasis in fiscal year on supply chain management and product development activities 
rohs conversion and compliance a key operational initiative facing the company s power electronics business in fiscal year and early in fiscal year relates to conversion of products to satisfy regulatory changes and customer demands driven by the european union s restriction on use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs 
the company s execution of these requirements  which involves product design changes among other matters  if not successful  would impact our ability to service customer order demands and risks of inventory obsolescence 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended january   compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activity was primarily due to i a higher net loss of  after adjusting for non cash impairment charges in both fiscal years  ii a decrease of  in other liabilities in fiscal year as compared to an increase of  in fiscal year  iii an increase of  in accounts receivable in fiscal year as compared to a decrease of  in fiscal year  and iv a  increase in inventories in fiscal year as compared to a  increase in fiscal year 
these changes were partially offset by i an increase of  in accounts payable in fiscal year as compared to an increase of  in fiscal year  ii an increase of  in other current liabilities in fiscal year as compared to a decrease of  in fiscal year  and iii a decrease in current taxes payable of in fiscal year as compared to a decrease of  in fiscal year the fiscal year receivable increases reflect the increased pace of the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  particularly in the power electronics division 
the increases in inventory that occurred in fiscal year reflect the company s decision to stock additional lead to protect against shortages of this important raw material 
additionally  the company has been increasing its inventory of motive power finished goods in order to more quickly meet the needs of our customers 
net cash used by investing activities decreased  or to  in the fiscal year as compared to  in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the acquisitions of celab  datel and cps and the receipt of approximately  from the chinese government as partial payment for the shanghai joint venture s existing battery facility  both of which occurred in the prior fiscal year 
these funds will be applied to the construction of a new battery manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  which began at the end of the fiscal year ended january  we had net cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal year as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in the prior fiscal year 
current year financing activities included  from new borrowings  primarily used to repay prior debt agreements 
other activities included a decrease in book overdrafts and the payment of financing costs related to the new debt agreements 
on november   the company completed the private placement of  aggregate principal amount of notes 
the company used substantially all of the net proceeds to reduce the balance of its existing revolving credit agreement 
on december   the company completed the refinancing of its debt with the closing of  principal amount of new credit facilities  consisting of i a  principal amount credit facility and ii a  term loan 
the credit facility consists of a five year senior revolving line of credit 
the maximum availability under the credit facility is  although at any time the company is limited by the amount available as determined by a borrowing base 
as of january   the maximum availability calculated under the borrowing base was  of which  was funded  and  was utilized for letters of credit 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on certain assets and initially bears interest at libor plus or prime plus 
as provided under the credit facility  excess borrowing capacity will be available for future working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
the term loan is a five and one half year term facility with payment due in the facility is secured by a second lien on certain assets and bears interest at libor plus or prime plus 
in anticipation of a possible future violation of the leverage ratio covenant under the term loan  and to provide greater flexibility with respect to this covenant  on march  the company executed a first amendment to both of these credit facilities 
these amendments modified the definition of ebitda of both credit facilities  changed the leverage ratio commencing february  through december  under the term loan facility and modified certain other definitions 
in consideration of these changes the company paid a fee of to the term loan lenders and to the credit facility lenders 
the company agreed to grant a security interest in its leola  pennsylvania battery plant and its mansfield  massachusetts electronics plant 
the company also agreed to an increase in the interest rate for the benefit of the term loan lenders of 
until such time as the leverage ratio falls below as defined in the amended term loan agreement 
the availability under the credit facility is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs for working capital requirements  debt service and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during fiscal year were incurred to fund cost reduction programs  normal maintenance and regulatory compliance 
fiscal year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  primarily for the construction of our new shanghai joint venture facility of which approximately  has already been received from the chinese government to fund construction 
the credit facility and term loan include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that is measured only when the excess availability as defined in the agreements is less than  both agreements limit restricted payments including dividends and treasury stock purchases to no more than for treasury stock in any one calendar year and  for dividends for any one calendar year subject to adjustments of up to per year in the case of the conversion of debt to stock per the terms of the convertible offering 
these restricted payments can only occur with prior notice to the lenders and provided that there is a minimum of  in excess availability for a period of thirty days prior to the dividend 
the term loan also includes a maximum leverage ratio 
on december  the entire proceeds of the term loan and approximately  of the initial proceeds of the credit facility were used to pay in full and terminate the existing  amended and restated revolving credit agreement which was entered into on june  former credit agreement  and which had a maturity date of june  the total aggregate amount of loans outstanding under the term loan  the notes and the credit facility  and the former credit agreement  at any point during the year ended january  was  and the outstanding loans under these credit agreements  computed on a monthly basis  averaged  at a weighted average interest rate of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
market risk factors we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include fluctuations in the price of raw materials  interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates 
to assist in management of these risks  on occasion we use derivative instruments 
we do not invest in derivative securities for speculative purposes  but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as well as to fluctuations in exchange rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk include our mortgage  capital leases  term and revolving credit facilities and our convertible notes 
the net market value of our debt instruments excluding capital lease obligations was  and  at january  and  respectively 
according to our established policies  we maintain certain ratios of fixed versus variable rate debt in order to mitigate our risk to changes in interest rates 
we utilize interest rate swaps when necessary to further manage this risk 
a increase in interest rates from their year end levels would result in an increase of in interest expense on an annualized basis  with all other variables held constant 
a decrease in interest rates from their year end levels would result in a decrease of in interest expense on an annualized basis  with all other variables held constant 
we use currency forwards and swaps to hedge anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies 
the exposures currently hedged are the british pound  euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar and mexican peso 
these financial instruments represent a net market value of and at january  and  respectively 
to monitor our currency exchange rate risk  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on earnings in the case of a change in exchange rates 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables being held constant 
at january  and  a strengthening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in an increase of the net market value of the forwards of  and  respectively 
at january  and  a weakening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in a decrease in the net market value of the forwards of  and  respectively 
the market value of the instruments was determined by taking into consideration the contracted interest rates and foreign exchange rates versus those available for similar maturities in the market at january  and  respectively 
foreign exchange forwards are used to hedge our firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there is either a balance sheet or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 
effective for fiscal year  we adopted a lead hedging policy 
we have entered into non deliverable forward contracts with certain financial counterparties to hedge our exposure to the fluctuations in the price of lead  the primary raw material component used in our power systems division 
we employ hedge accounting in the treatment of these contracts 
changes in the value of the contracts are marked to market each month and the gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until they are released to the income statement through cost of goods sold in the same period as is the hedged item lead 
as of january  we had hedged approximately million pounds of lead at an average price of per pound 
effective february   one of the company s financial counterparties exercised its right to terminate million pounds of lead forward contracts  representing approximately  in lead 
this settlement resulted in cash proceeds of  the settlement does not change the hedge accounting for these forward contracts  with the gain in comprehensive loss income continuing to be released to earnings during fiscal in the month in which the hedged item is recognized in cost of sales 
the net market value of our lead contracts was  at january  at january   a increase in the price of lead would result in a  increase in the market value  and a decrease in the price of lead would result in a  decrease in the market value 
at january   we did not utilize any lead forward contracts
