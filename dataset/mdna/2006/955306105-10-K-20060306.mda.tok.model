item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
company overview we are a global pharmaceutical technology company that applies proprietary materials science  formulation research and manufacturing innovation to the quality  therapeutic value  development speed and rapid market availability of pharmaceuticals  biologics  vaccines and consumer products 
we have manufacturing locations in north and south america  europe and asia  with partners in mexico and japan 
we have two reportable segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group 
our pharmaceutical systems segment focuses on primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery  including stoppers and seals for vials  and closures and disposable components used in syringe  intravenous and blood collection systems 
the pharmaceutical systems segment has two operating segments that sell a similar range of products  manufactured from elastomer and metal components  in their respective geographic regions the americas and europe asia 
the pharmaceutical systems segment includes the results of medimop  a company acquired in august that specializes in reconstitution  mixing and fluid transfer technologies for injectable drugs in vials  bags  ampoules and syringes 
the tech group segment was created following the may acquisition of substantially all of the american and european assets of the tech group  inc tgi 
this segment is composed of our previously existing device group operating unit and the acquired tgi business 
as a combined unit  our tech group segment is a global leader in plastic injection molding  offering custom contract manufacturing solutions for healthcare and consumer industries 
products and projects include the design and manufacture of unique components and assemblies for surgical  ophthalmic  diagnostic and drug delivery systems  such as contact lens storage kits  pill dispensers  safety needle and pen based injection systems  diagnostic sample containers and components and systems associated with drug inhalation devices 
the segment also provides molds and assembles consumer product components  including printer cartridges  resealable closures for juice and dairy products  writing pens and markers  and so called smart cards  which incorporate electronic read write capability into plastic cards 
our global customer base includes the world s leading manufacturers of pharmaceuticals  biologics and medical devices 
while growth in those markets may fluctuate due to a range of factors  we anticipate relatively steady growth due to the nature of the products and services we provide 
we recently introduced value added products such as advanced coating technologies flurotec and b coating  components processed in accordance with the latest regulatory requirements  and post manufacturing options westar that eliminate time and capital intense operations from customers manufacturing processes 
our service offerings are bolstered through our acquisition of monarch labs  and our engineering and design programs are enhanced through the acquisition of medimop and tech 
in addition  we will see growth through investment in innovation programs 
for example  we will expand our reconstitution systems portfolio  introduce refinements in our prefilled syringe systems and launch a line of vial seals with enhanced product security features 
within the overall pharmaceutical market there are many potential opportunities and challenges that influence our decisions and bear on our future financial performance 
we believe that demographic and economic factors are generally favorable for our business 
these include an aging population that is expected to consume more healthcare products and services  the increased occurrence and treatment of chronic disorders  including diabetes  and increased spending on healthcare in the world s developing economies 
we continue to benefit from favorable trends in pharmaceutical product development 
most notably  a majority of new drug product approvals in the us and europe have been of biotechnology products 
because of their biological content  these products are not typically formulated as oral drugs and must be delivered parenterally literally  around or avoiding the digestive tract  most commonly by injection or iv infusion  frequently as a lyophilized freeze dried powder that requires reconstitution at the point of use 
we are the world s leading manufacturer of elastomer components and seals used in packaging liquid and lyophilized drugs and expect to continue to benefit from the growing use of parenterally administered drugs 
many of these biologic products have high per dose therapeutic and economic value but are more sensitive to degradation during filling and storage 
as a result  our customers generally employ components that provide the highest level of protection for their products  including our teflon and flurotec coated products and printed and embossed seals 
prefilled syringes continue to gain market share for injectable drug products 
this product presentation is typically more convenient for pharmacists  patients and clinicians because it can reduce or eliminate the use of glass ampoules  the number of steps and associated error and needle exposures involved in the drug preparation process and permits the drug maker to provide more precise doses 
in january  the fda and the european medicines agency ema granted marketing approval for exubera inhalation powder  a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar  that will be marketed by pfizer  inc our tech group is one of two contract manufacturers for nektar s inhalation delivery device 
although the product faces significant challenges in gaining acceptance among physicians and diabetic patients  current expectations for the product are positive 
particular lines of business that have benefited or will benefit from these trends include prefilled syringe components and coated closures  lyophilization stoppers and reconstitution aids  which are used in the packaging and point of use reconstitution of freeze dried drug products  seals incorporating anti counterfeiting features and printed product use labeling  contract manufacturing and assembly of systems for inhaled insulin  multiple use injection pens and auto injectors  and laminated materials used in lined seals  particularly for the packaging of insulin 
some of these products and methods replace traditional vials and single use syringes  and will negatively affect sales of our products for those uses standard vial stoppers and syringe plungers 
other factors that may affect our competitiveness and profitability include lower cost competitors  for both our customers drug products that incorporate our components and for our components  may increase price driven competition for our products 
these include generic versions of drugs and packaging components sourced from lower cost economies  including china and india 
recent increases in energy and petroleum based material costs  new technologies incorporating oral  trans dermal or nasal technologies are emerging that compete with traditional injectable drug delivery methods 
in order to sustain cost competitiveness  we are pursuing a lean manufacturing program that was initiated in  which is focused on reducing our total cost of doing business  increasing our production capacity in lower cost locations  and evaluating the opportunities to expand our production capabilities by acquiring or constructing an additional facility in asia 
in order to recoup higher raw material costs  we increased prices on non contract sales effective january  and have the ability under most of our contracts to increase prices at least annually 
contract price escalators vary and can include terms that reference either specific commodity prices or general price level increases 
we believe that the combined effects of cost savings and price increases will neutralize the impact of recent and expected material cost increases 
the acquisition of tgi is intended to combine our industry and drug product and materials expertise with tgi s engineering  project management  molding and assembly capabilities in order to participate in the growing demand for components and devices involved in other routes of drug delivery 
the acquisition of medimop medical projects  ltd 
provides us with a number of new products and with new product development expertise focused on the need for safe  reliable and convenient drug reconstitution and fluid transfer at the point of use  which we are well positioned to market to customers employing our lyophilization products 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to develop or acquire products  manufacturing and service capabilities  and expand our geographic reach in order to enhance our ability to meet the developing needs of our pharmaceutical  diagnostic  medical device and consumer products customers 
our key financial performance indicators include sales and operating income growth  earnings per share  corporate cash flow operating cash flow  less capital expenditures and dividends paid and return on invested capital 
sales for were above levels  with the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange translation contributing and percentage points of the increase  respectively 
operating profit in was higher than in earnings from continuing operations in were per diluted share compared to per diluted share in corporate cash flow in was million  an increase of million over that achieved during despite higher interest costs connected with acquisition activity 
return on invested capital for was over 
in addition  west s non financial performance indicators including on time delivery  product discrepancy resolution and compliance tests all indicated high levels of performance and customer satisfaction 
management expects full year revenues under us gaap to be between and million  which would represent approximately to growth over revenues  ten percentage points of this growth reflects the timing of the acquisitions as us gaap includes revenues for businesses acquired during the year only from the date of acquisition 
management s revenue estimates assume an average exchange rate of u 
s dollars per euro  resulting in a decrease of approximately one percentage point in the comparison of projected to revenues 
excluding the timing effect of acquisitions and anticipated foreign currency exchange rate changes  we expect revenue growth to be between and 
management expects that full year earnings will be between and per diluted share 
as a result of the acquisition activity  our debt level has increased to million at december  with a debt to total capitalization ratio of compared to at december  in february  we amended our revolving credit facility to a maximum capacity of million for a term expiring in and refinanced our million private placement notes as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  subsequent events senior notes 
the refinancing activities have allowed us to fix the interest rates on the majority of our debt at favorable levels which will result in lower interest costs in future periods 
we anticipate that the net cash flow generated from operations  including those of our acquired businesses  will allow us to reduce the debt to total capital ratio by approximately two percentage points by the end of results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december   and our financial position as of december   should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the operating results of our former clinical service unit and drug delivery research business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our financial statements include the results of the acquired businesses for periods subsequent to their acquisition date 
for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year to year results  reference is made in management s discussion and analysis to results excluding the impact of acquisitions and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
those re measured period results are not in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are non gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures are intended to explain or aid in the use of  not as a substitute for  the related gaap financial measures 
net sales the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment and product group in millions pharmaceutical packaging disposable medical components personal care food packaging laboratory and other services pharmaceutical systems segment healthcare devices consumer products engineering tooling services tech group segment intersegment sales total net sales consolidated net sales increased over sales reported in sales in the tgi  medimop and monarch businesses are included in results for periods subsequent to their acquisition date and represented percentage points of the sales increase versus the prior year 
favorable foreign exchange rate translation variances contributed percentage points of the sales increase 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange variances  net sales increased over sales 
in the pharmaceutical systems segment  net sales were above levels 
acquired businesses contributed million of sales to results 
foreign exchange translation variances were million favorable to the prior year 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange  net sales in the pharmaceutical systems segment were million  or  above those achieved in sales in international markets were excluding exchange effects higher than levels driven by strong demand for pharmaceutical packaging components used in pre filled syringe systems for the delivery of our customers insulin products for diabetes  cancer treatments  vaccines and dental applications 
in the united states  net sales excluding acquired businesses were over levels 
our sales growth in the united states was moderated by the impact of planned formulation changes in specialty coated stoppers used in serum and lyophilized pharmaceutical packaging products 
our customers increased their inventory levels of these products during in order to ensure adequate supplies for pending approval of the formulation changes 
this resulted in an million decrease in net sales  as our customers worked down their inventory levels during the year 
now that the formulation changes have been approved and accepted by our customers  we anticipate a recovery of this business during in the united states  sales of other pharmaceutical packaging products including flip off seals and pre filled syringe components  disposable medical components used in intravenous fitments and other syringe components  and demand for tooling and laboratory services more than offset the impact of the formulation change 
our westar line of elastomeric components that have been processed and packaged for direct entry into our customers sterilization units continues to benefit from growing customer acceptance with worldwide sales growth of over the prior year 
in our tech group segment  net sales were million  with the acquired tgi business accounting for million of segment sales consisting of healthcare devices million  consumer products million and tooling projects million 
the acquired business s emphasis on high quality custom injected plastic molding for the pharmaceutical and medical device markets has resulted in strong sales of component parts for surgical devices  insulin pens and contact lens casting cups 
in  the tech group segment recorded million of net sales to nektar inc for validation and other testing  in support of a pulmonary delivery device for exubera inhalation powder  an insulin product approved by the fda and ema in january for the treatment of diabetes 
excluding the results of the acquired business  our previously existing plastic molding operations yielded net sales of million consisting of healthcare devices of million  including million to the pharmaceutical systems segment  consumer products of million  and tooling and design services of million and were above levels 
sales of consumer products increased by  led by increased demand for custom plastic parts used in orange juice containers 
the growth in the consumer business was partially offset by declines in healthcare device  tooling and other revenues related to the closure of our uk medical device facility 
consolidated net sales increased over sales reported in approximately of the sales increase resulted from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies against the us dollar in foreign currency exchange markets 
sales in the united states were almost above prior year levels  while sales in international markets increased by over  of which was due to foreign currency translation 
in the pharmaceutical systems segment  sales were million above results  with favorable foreign exchange rates contributing million of the increase 
sales of specialty coated serum and lyophilized stoppers accounted for million of the increase with much of the demand attributed to customers increasing inventory levels prior to formulation changes in the coating process 
the pharmaceutical systems segment also benefited from a million increase in sales of components used in the packaging of an ulcer treatment drug  and increases in personal care products including baby nurser nipples produced in brazil 
the sales increase in the laboratory and other services category is largely attributed to increased tooling and engineering design service revenue on product development projects 
in the tech group segment  which in consisted only of our previously existing plastic device unit  revenue increases were led by strong sales of consumer packaging components  principally related to fresh juice packaging  and related low margin customer tooling revenues  which more than offset a decline in healthcare device sales connected to the closure of our plastic device manufacturing facility in the united kingdom 
gross profit consolidated gross profit improved to million in  a million increase over results 
the acquired businesses contributed million of the increase in gross profit  principally within the tech group segment 
the pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for the remaining gross profit increase  generated by higher sales volumes in europe and improved operating efficiencies in north america resulting from the resumption of normal molding operations at our re built kinston  north carolina facility 
our consolidated gross margin was in and in the impact of the acquired businesses on our consolidated gross margin in was a reduction of percentage points reflecting the increase in lower margin revenues within the acquired tgi business 
gross margins in the pharmaceutical systems segment improved by percentage points over the prior year as many of the interim production costs incurred during the construction and validation of the new facility were not incurred during the decreased interim production costs were partially offset by higher depreciation  plant overhead and utility costs at the new plant 
sales price increases helped to offset higher raw material  energy and labor costs but produced no net improvement in gross margin 
overall product mix variances in were negligible as the decline in higher margin coated product sales within the pharmaceutical systems segment were offset by increased sales of pre filled syringe systems and westar processed products with similar margins 
tech group segment gross margins include the impact of tooling revenues which carry gross margins averaging three percent 
excluding tooling  tech group segment gross margins on healthcare and consumer products average approximately of net sales 
gross profit and gross margin by segment in millions pharmaceutical systems gross profit gross margin tech group gross profit gross margin consolidated gross profit gross margin in our consolidated gross margin declined by percentage points to versus in the majority of the decrease in the gross margin within our pharmaceutical systems segment was associated with the costs incurred in implementing interim production strategies following the january explosion at our production facility in kinston  north carolina 
during  these costs totaled million  but were completely offset by business interruption insurance reimbursements 
we reached a settlement agreement with our insurer at the end of  and as a result of the agreement  no further insurance coverage was available for costs incurred in subsequent periods 
in  similar costs totaling million were incurred resulting in a percentage point decline in pharmaceutical systems segment gross margins and a percentage point decrease in consolidated gross margin 
during  we completed the reconstruction of molding operations at a new facility in kinston and by the fourth quarter of the majority of the costs associated with the interim production plans had ceased 
tech group segment gross margins were relatively consistent over the three year period  with most of the improvement over reflecting the favorable impact of the closure of a uk production facility 
selling  general and adminstrative costs consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in sg a costs within the acquired business units accounted for million of the increase 
the following table reports selling  general and administrative costs by reportable segment including corporate and unallocated costs for the three year period ended december  in millions pharmaceutical systems sg a costs pharmaceutical systems sg a as a of segment net sales tech group sg a costs tech group sg a as a of segment net sales corporate costs general corporate costs restricted stock plan stock options employee stock purchase plan us pension plan expense total selling  general administrative costs total sg a as a of total net sales pharmaceutical systems segment sg a costs increased by million over levels 
sg a costs within the acquired medimop and monarch labs businesses accounted for million of the increase 
higher compensation costs of million associated with annual salary increases and sales incentive programs  increased consulting costs of million for information systems projects  lean manufacturing programs and marketing studies and unfavorable foreign exchange variances of million accounted for the remainder of the increase in pharmaceutical systems segment sg a costs over pharmaceutical systems sg a in was million higher than in due to million of foreign exchange rate variances  million in compensation cost increases and million of consulting costs associated with business development and sarbanes oxley compliance activities 
tech group segment sg a costs increased by million over with the acquired business accounting for million of the variance  offset by a small decline in consulting costs within the previously existing plastic device unit 
in  tech group segment sg a costs increased by million compared to principally due to increased staffing of sales and marketing functions 
general corporate costs include executive officer costs  board of director s compensation  legal  compliance  finance and communication expenses 
in  these costs decreased by million from levels primarily as a result of a million decrease in stock price indexed board of director s compensation plans and a million decrease in legal fees connected with the kinston explosion and related fire 
in  general corporate costs exceeded levels by million primarily due to million in legal costs associated with finalizing regulatory investigations and responding to plaintiffs in lawsuits filed in connection with kinston accident related matters 
other versus general corporate cost increases included a million increase in stock based board of director s compensation fees and a million increase in other professional service fees consisting principally of increased legal and patent costs 
compensation costs for performance vesting restricted share awards to senior management pvr share awards under the stock based compensation plan were million and million in and  respectively 
the million decline in costs associated with the pvr share plan principally reflects the expense connected with an initial performance award which vested entirely upon results rather than the two and three year performance periods associated with subsequent awards 
please refer to note  stock option and award plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within item of this report for additional details on the pvr share award program 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard share based payment revised sfas r using the modified prospective transition method which requires that stock based employee compensation costs be measured at fair value and recorded as an expense over the requisite service period 
additionally  compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards that are outstanding at january   will be recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under the pro forma disclosures under sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  our stock option plans did not result in expense recognition under the intrinsic value method for stock based compensation prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the million charge recorded in selling  general and administrative costs in consists of million for stock option programs and million associated with our employee stock purchase plan which allows employees to purchase west shares at of the market price at the beginning or end of a six month offering period a look back option 
an additional million of employee stock purchase plan costs associated with manufacturing employees was recorded in cost of goods and services sold within the pharmaceutical systems segment 
total compensation expense related to the adoption of fas r accounted for per diluted share during in early  the employee stock purchase plan was modified  eliminating the look back option  requiring employees to contribute to the plan through payroll deductions only and establishing quarterly offering periods 
if the fair value based method prescribed by sfas r had been applied to earlier periods  our results would have included additional pre tax stock compensation costs for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of million and million for the years and  respectively 
in  us pension plan expenses remained approximately even with levels  as the recovery of equity markets during increased the value of pension plan assets resulting in higher investment income in subsequent periods 
in  we anticipate that us pension expenses will increase to approximately million due to higher benefit obligation liabilities generated by changes in actuarial mortality assumptions and the decrease in the discount rate at december  versus at december   used to measure plan liabilities 
insurance settlement on january   our kinston  nc plant suffered an explosion and related fire that resulted in six deaths  a number of injured personnel and substantial damage to the building  machinery and equipment and raw material inventories 
our property and business interruption coverage with our principal insurer provided for a maximum insurance recovery of million 
we reached an agreement with our insurer that the total losses for business interruption  insured incremental costs and property replacement would exceed the maximum recoverable amount  resulting in the final settlement of the insurance claim for the full million reimbursement 
the final accounting for the insurance settlement and related costs is presented below in millions insurance coverage reimbursement costs and expenses business interruption costs insured incremental costs book value of property and equipment uninsured legal and investigation costs total costs and expenses gain on insurance settlement  net of related costs restructuring charges in connection with the closure of a plastic device manufacturing plant in the united kingdom  we have recorded a favorable restructuring related adjustment of million in  following restructuring charges of million and million in and respectively 
the decision to close the uk plant followed a decision by a marketing and distribution partner of our customer to terminate its involvement with the principal product produced by the facility 
the initial million charge recorded in included an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the expected fair value of the equipment at this site  asset retirement obligations at the leased facilities and a provision for statutory post employment benefit costs deemed probable of being paid 
during  we transferred the remaining customers of the plant to other west facilities  ceased all production activities at the uk operation and recorded a million restructuring charge for the excess of future lease costs over expected sub lease rental income  as well as additional severance expense and repair costs necessary to return the leased facility to its original condition 
in we reached final settlement of all remaining lease obligations resulting in reduction of previously estimated cost accruals of million 
other expense income other expense income was million  million and million for years  and  respectively 
in millions foreign exchange losses gains loss on sales of equipment and other assets other total other expense results include a million impairment of an investment in a company that had been developing genomics analysis technology following that company s unsuccessful efforts in finding a commercial sponsor 
operating profit operating profit loss by reportable segment  corporate and other unallocated costs were as follows in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group us pension expenses general corporate costs restricted stock plan stock option and employee stock purchase plan restructuring items insurance settlement consolidated operating profit the businesses acquired during contributed million pharmaceutical systems million and tech group million of the million consolidated operating profit increase over the remaining to operating profit improvement in the pharmaceutical systems segment of million was principally the result of increased sales volumes in europe and lower production costs in the united states following the resumption of normal production activities at our kinston facility 
the comparison of pharmaceutical systems operating profit to is affected by a million insurance reimbursement for business interruption costs recorded in as a result of the final insurance settlement recorded at the end of  no additional insurance coverage was available to offset similar costs incurred in subsequent periods 
tech group segment operating profit improved throughout the three year period ending in  principally benefiting from the acquisition of the tgi business and cost savings following the closure of the former uk facility at the end of interest expense net the following table summarizes our net interest expense for the three year period ended december  in millions interest expense capitalized interest interest income interest expense net net interest expense increased million over the prior year 
as a result of the acquisition activity  average borrowing levels increased by in and accounted for million of the interest expense increase 
total debt outstanding at december  was million compared to million at december  the remaining million increase in interest expense was caused by higher interest rates on variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the average interest rate on variable rate borrowings was in compared to in net interest expense declined million in as compared to results  largely as a result of lower average debt levels and an increase in capitalized interest associated with the kinston construction project 
income taxes the effective tax rate on consolidated income from continuing operations was in  in and in in we repatriated million in earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the united states parent companies 
the foreign repatriations were made in accordance with the provisions of the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the ajca provided a temporary incentive for us multi national companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in controlled foreign corporations by providing an percent dividends received deduction on qualified distributions occurring before december  our results include a million net tax charge million gross tax cost  less million of foreign tax credits and million in previously established accruals for unremitted earnings incurred in connection with the repatriation program which increased our overall effective tax rate by percentage points 
the restructuring credit in the uk allowed us to utilize prior year loss carry forwards and therefore decreased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in addition  we reduced tax contingencies connected with the closure of tax years in certain international locations resulting in a percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year us tax return  a change in french tax law extending the life of net operating loss carry forwards and the reversal of reserves attributable to the closing of tax years 
the combined impact of these items  offset partially by the non deductible restructuring charge  resulted in a percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the impairment charge in the united kingdom which did not result in a tax benefit as management does not expect to generate future taxable income in the specific uk legal entity sufficient to utilize net operating loss carry forwards 
additionally  management provided a million valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset connected with this location that was unlikely to be realized 
these items increased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
equity in affiliates the contribution to earnings from our ownership interest in daikyo seiko  ltd 
in japan and ownership interest in three companies in mexico was income of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the results achieved during the last two years reflect the impact on daikyo s results of customer purchases during of a product in advance of a pending fda approval of a required product reformulation 
the increased customer inventory levels accumulated during resulted in lower sales levels for daikyo in as customers utilized existing inventory pending validation of the new formulation 
the operating results of the mexican affiliates improved on strong sales growth generating results equal to those recorded in which included a non operating million gain on the sale of real estate 
our purchases from all affiliates totaled approximately million in  million in and million in  the majority of which relates to our distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and re sell daikyo products 
sales to affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income from continuing operations our net income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share 
these results included incremental income tax expense of million  or per diluted share  associated with the repatriation of foreign sourced income under the american jobs creation act of results for also include a restructuring credit which increased net income from continuing operations by million  or 
per diluted share 
net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share 
results for include incremental manufacturing costs of million million  net of tax  or per share associated with the interim production processes that were put in place following the kinston accident 
in the prior year these incremental manufacturing costs were reimbursed under insurance coverage 
results also include kinston related legal expenses of million million net of tax  or per share 
the closure of a manufacturing plant in the uk resulted in restructuring charges of million per share 
equity income included a million per share real estate gain 
results also include million per share of favorable tax adjustments resulting from utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year tax return and a change in french tax legislation 
net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share 
results for included a net gain from an insurance settlement of million million  net of tax  or per share  and asset impairment and post employment benefit charges at the uk device operation of million million including a related tax charge  or per share 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share 
the majority of the income was generated from the august sale of the clinical services unit pre tax gain of million  million net of tax 
operating losses and other costs associated with the sale of our former drug delivery business completed in the first quarter of totaled million million  net of tax  more than offsetting the operating income of million million  net of tax generated by the clinical services unit prior to its divestiture 
in december  we entered into a share and asset purchase agreement to sell our drug delivery business to a new company formed by warburg pincus private equity viii and warburg pincus international partners to facilitate the acquisition 
the sales price consisted of million receivable due in cash at the closing date and a ownership interest in the new company valued at million 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded a pre tax loss of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
the million net tax expense is primarily the result of the reversal of current and prior year tax benefits that may no longer be available as a result of the transaction 
in december we also announced our intention to exit the clinical services business 
the operating results of the drug delivery business and clinical service unit are classified within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the pre tax loss from the discontinued drug delivery and clinical services operations was million and million for the years and  respectively 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows generated from operations totaled million in  compared to million in operating cash flows improved in all geographic regions  with the strongest growth occurring in north america  reflecting the re start of operations at our kinston facility and a corresponding decrease in interim production costs 
operating cash flows include million of insurance collections received in that helped to offset the payment of liabilities related to the kinston accident 
consolidated capital spending for totaled million  compared to million in which included million related to the construction of the new kinston molding operation 
the pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for million of our total capital spending  consisting of million in equipment replacements  rubber tooling projects and facility improvements  million in plant expansion activity in europe  and million in information systems projects 
capital spending for equipment and facility upgrades within the tech group segment totaled million  of which million related to projects within the acquired business 
general corporate and other projects account for the remaining million of capital expenditures 
we anticipate that total capital spending will be approximately million pharmaceutical systems segment million  tech group segment million and general corporate million 
approximately million of the projected capital spending is targeted for normal equipment replacements  facility maintenance and tooling projects 
the capital spending estimate also includes million in new product and expansion projects and million in information systems upgrades 
cash flows from investing activities include the february  acquisition of monarch  a contract laboratory business  the may  purchase of tgi  a plastic device and molding business and the august  acquisition of medimop  a business focused on reconstitution and mixing technologies for injectable products 
the following table summarizes the total purchase price paid for each business monarch tgi medimop total in millions total purchase price non cash stock payment cash on hand in acquired units net cash used in acquisitions cash flows provided by investing operations include a million loan repayment received from our affiliate in mexico and million in proceeds from surplus equipment sales 
cash provided by investing activities in includes million of insurance proceeds related to the kinston accident  which helped to fund the reconstruction of the new facility 
financing cash flows in include proceeds from stock option exercises and related tax benefits totaling million 
dividends paid to shareholders were million per share 
the board of directors intends to continue the practice of declaring dividends following their quarterly review of the west pharmaceutical services inc s financial condition and results of operations 
management expects that cash flows from continuing operations  net of capital spending requirements  will provide sufficient funding for the current dividend policy 
financing cash flows also reflect the million in cash borrowed under revolving credit and other long term debt agreements to fund our acquisition activity 
refer to note  debt  for a discussion of the principal changes in our debt structure 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect the obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total in millions unconditional purchase obligations long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations pension and other post retirement benefit obligations total contractual obligations included in the three to five year long term debt payments of million are million of senior notes maturing april  on january   we notified the noteholders of our intention to prepay the notes effective february  we have financed the prepayment by issuing new senior unsecured notes having a weighted average maturity of just over nine years 
see note  subsequent event senior notes  for further information 
we have letters of credit totaling million supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment leases in ireland 
the accrual for insurance obligations was million at december  at december  our consolidated debt was million and our debt to total invested capital total debt  minority interest and shareholders equity ratio was compared to at december  our cash and cash equivalents balance was million at december   compared to million at december  both the increase in debt levels and decrease in cash were incurred to support the acquisition activity in our december  net working capital totaled million and the ratio of current assets to liabilities was to we believe that our financial condition  current capitalization and expected income from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our future expected cash requirements 
off balance sheet agreements at december   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and equipment lease guarantees as noted above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position of west pharmaceutical services  inc revenue recognition sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes 
management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained 
we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue associated with tooling and other engineering service agreements is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
for agreements with multiple deliverables  we assess whether more than one unit of accounting exists 
if more than one unit exists  revenue for each separate unit based on the calculated allocation is recorded as earned 
impairment of long lived assets we review goodwill and long lived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the operating segment to which it belongs 
we have determined our operating segments to be the americas and europe asia divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment  and the tech group segment 
for assets held and used in the business  management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit 
when assets are held for sale  management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset  less disposition costs 
changes in the estimate of fair value  including the estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
employee benefits the measurement of the obligations under our defined benefit pension and post retirement medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions 
these include the rate of return on plan assets and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value 
for us plans  which account for over of global plan assets  the long term rate of return assumption decreased to in from in in  the long term rate of return assumption is 
the return assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return over a year period for the expected mix of plan assets approximately equity and debt securities 
the discount rate was reduced basis points to at december   to reflect current market conditions 
the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to the plans projected benefit payments 
changes in these estimates  including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
every basis point reduction in the long term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million 
in addition  restructuring events such as plant closures or changes in pension plan provisions could result in curtailment or settlement of pension plan obligations  which would result in gain or loss recognition in the period when such an event occurs 
we are currently monitoring the progress of a financial accounting standards board fasb project to comprehensively reconsider the guidance in fasb statement  employers accounting for pensions  and fasb statement  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
one of the current recommendations of the project is to recognize the funded status of a pension plan on the balance sheet 
under the current standard  the funded status of a plan is disclosed in the footnotes 
differences between expected and actual experience and plan amendments are currently reflected in the footnote disclosure as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses or unrecognized prior service costs  and are amortized into expense over future service periods 
as currently defined  the fasb project on pensions recommends the recognition of a liability for any under funded pension plan where the projected benefit obligation of the plan exceeds the fair value of its assets 
if the proposed standard were in effect at december   we would be required to record an million liability for our us qualified pension plan  rather than the million asset currently reflected on our balance sheet 
the impact of these changes would reduce shareholders equity by million million pre tax  less a million reduction of deferred tax liabilities 
the fasb expects to issue an exposure draft for public comment in march  and currently intends that the proposed changes would apply to fiscal years ending after december  income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation 
in addition  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability  generally at the local subsidiary company and country level 
changes in tax legislation  business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 
during  the fasb published and deliberated an exposure draft  accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
proposed interpretation 
this project seeks to clarify what criteria must be met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit of a position taken in a tax return 
currently  we record the benefit of an uncertain tax position only when it is realized or probable that our position will be sustained 
under the proposed interpretation  a tax position would be recognized when the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the board expects the final interpretation  which would include amendments to statement  to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will encourage earlier application 
management has not yet determined what impact  if any  the proposed changes may have on our financial statements 
inventories accounting for inventories involves estimates regarding the proper determination of manufacturing cost  obsolescence and identifying inventory values that exceed estimated market values 
the determination of manufacturing cost includes the identification of direct material costs and allocations of direct labor  variable production costs and overhead 
allocations of fixed overhead costs are based on estimates of normal capacity and require judgment when production levels are below normal so that idle capacity costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the valuation of inventories is also subject to usage or flow assumptions 
over of our inventory is accounted for under a combination of the first in  first out fifo and average cost inventory usage methods 
the remaining inventory  primarily located in the united states  is accounted for under the last in  first out lifo method 
we are currently evaluating the possibility of converting all domestic west pharmaceutical services locations to the fifo method 
management expects to complete its evaluation during the first quarter of a change from lifo to fifo would not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the following describes the nature of these risks 
all debt securities and derivative instruments are considered non trading 
foreign currency exchange risk we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for approximately of consolidated net sales 
virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars 
although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary and are therefore also translated into us dollars  the foreign subsidiaries may hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency 
these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing exchange rates 
we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize month end balance sheet exposures on cross currency intercompany loans 
we have forward contracts with a combined fair market value of thousand as of december  to sell currencies in asia 
we also have an outstanding loan denominated in japanese yen to hedge the investment in our japanese affiliate 
at december   a thousand loss is included in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment related to this hedge 
interest rate risk as a result of our normal borrowing activities  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which we manage primarily through our financing activities 
we have long term debt with both fixed and variable interest rates 
long term debt consists of senior notes  revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
portions of long term debt which are payable during are classified as short term liabilities as of december  the following table summarizes our interest rate risk sensitive instruments carrying fair thereafter value value in thousands current debt and capital leases us dollar denominated average interest rate fixed euro denominated average interest rate fixed long term debt and capital leases us dollar denominated average interest rate fixed us dollar denominated average interest rate variable euro denominated average interest rate fixed euro denominated average interest rate variable krone denominated average interest rate variable yen denominated average interest ratevariable see note to our consolidated financial statements  subsequent event senior notes  for additional information on the refinancing of these notes in february we have entered into two interest rate swap agreements effectively transforming  of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt with interest rates averaging
