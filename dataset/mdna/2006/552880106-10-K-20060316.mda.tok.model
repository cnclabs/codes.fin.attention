aloxi injection aloxi the former guilford acute care sales team was trained and is now actively promoting aloxi to hospital based oncologists 
a scale up of this team is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the company anticipates a three fold increase in hospital focused sales force activity in support of aloxi and an impact on sales growth beginning in the second quarter of preparations are also underway for a targeted direct to consumer advertising campaign  which is planned to roll out during the second quarter of dacogen injection dacogen we received an approvable letter from the food and drug administration fda for dacogen during september we responded to that approvable letter during the fourth quarter of  and the fda accepted this response with a prescription drug user fee act pdufa goal date of may  we expect to be prepared to commercialize this product within several weeks of fda approval 
dacogen is being evaluated in a broad clinical development program consisting of more than clinical trials  including phase and studies in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia aml  an alternate dosing regimen in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes mds  and a phase european organization for research and treatment of cancer eortc sponsored trial in patients with mds 
saforis powder for oral suspension saforis a guidance meeting was held with the fda in the fourth quarter of to discuss the saforis new drug application nda 
following this meeting  we remain on track to submit this nda in the second quarter of aquavan injection aquavan following analysis of data from a phase dose ranging study of aquavan  a dose was selected to advance into a pivotal program 
this program  which will consist of two pivotal phase trials and one safety study  began during the first quarter of business strategy our goal is to become a leading oncology and acute care focused biopharmaceutical company serving well defined markets

marketable products aloxi injection for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection aloxi is a potent  highly selective serotonin subtype  or ht  receptor antagonist differentiated by its strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life for the prevention of cinv 
we obtained exclusive us and canada aloxi license and distribution rights from helsinn healthcare sa in april on july   approval was received from the fda to market aloxi for the prevention of acute and delayed cinv 
we began promoting aloxi through our oncology focused sales organization in september  and through our acute care sales organization in january we estimate that the market for the use of ht receptor antagonists for cinv is approximately billion 
product sales of aloxi in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting overview depending on the type of cancer and treatment goals determined by physicians  patients may receive chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen 
cinv is one of the side effects of chemotherapy treatments that patients fear most 
supportive care products to treat the side effects of chemotherapy  such as cinv  have emerged to improve patient comfort and compliance with treatment regimens 
efforts to treat tumors such as those found in breast and lung cancer have led physicians to administer more aggressive chemotherapy regimens 
these cytotoxic agents often cause cinv by triggering release of serotonin from cells in the gastrointestinal tract 
the released serotonin stimulates nerve receptors that activate the vomiting center via the chemoreceptor trigger zone 
when  and if  serotonin stimulates serotonin subtype  or ht 
receptors to initiate nerve impulses to the central nervous system through the ht receptors  vomiting  or emesis  may ensue 
serotonin subtype  or ht receptor antagonists  such as aloxi  act by binding to serotonin receptors in the peripheral and possibly central nervous system  thereby blocking serotonin stimulation of the associated nerves and reducing or eliminating cinv 
cinv can be characterized as acute nausea and vomiting  occurring within hours following administration of chemotherapy  or delayed nausea and vomiting  occurring to hours following administration of chemotherapy 
although cinv has been managed to a greater degree in recent years  it is estimated that up to percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy will experience some degree of emesis if not prevented with an antiemetic 
the severity of emesis is dependent upon the type of chemotherapy administered  the dosing schedule of the chemotherapy  and the patient s age and gender  among other predisposing factors 
if emesis is not properly managed  it can cause dehydration and poor quality of life  eventually leading to interruption or discontinuation of chemotherapy 
although the vast majority of patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy are administered a ht receptor antagonist  there remains a need to improve upon the prevention of acute cinv and  especially delayed cinv 
despite the availability of preventive treatments  including first generation ht receptor antagonists  nearly fifty percent of all patients receiving chemotherapy experience nausea and vomiting 
aloxi clinical data for cinv the results of phase clinical trials demonstrate that aloxi is more effective than zofran ondansetron  marketed by glaxosmithkline  and anzemet dolasetron  marketed by aventis pharmaceuticals  injections 
the most frequently prescribed chemotherapies  including those used to treat the most common cancers such as breast  lung and colon  are considered moderately emetogenic  or have a moderate to moderately high potential to cause nausea and vomiting 
based on the phase trials conducted  aloxi is differentiated by its strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life and has already been approved for the prevention of cinv 
overall  the incidence  pattern  duration  and intensity of adverse reactions were similar among patients treated with aloxi and other ht receptor antagonists 
in patients treated with aloxi during phase trials  the most common adverse reactions related to the study drug were headache percent  and constipation percent 
the table below provides a summary of the efficacy results from these pivotal phase clinical trials  where complete response rate is defined as the proportion of treated patients who had no vomiting and no rescue medication 
highly emetogenic moderately emetogenic chemotherapy chemotherapy study study study aloxi ondansetron aloxi dolasetron aloxi ondansetron acute cinv hours delayed cinv hours overall hours indicates results that demonstrate statistically greater efficacy than the alternative ht product compared in the trial 
we believe that aloxi is competitive in the us cinv market for us receptor antagonists because aloxi is highly selective for the ht receptor and has at least a thirty times stronger binding affinity for this receptor than other marketed htreceptor antagonists  is more potent than other marketed ht receptor antagonists  has demonstrated a plasma elimination half life of almost hours  which is four to ten times longer than any other marketed ht receptor antagonist  has a strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life for the prevention of cinv and is the only ht receptor antagonist approved to prevent both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy 
the potency and extended half life of aloxi may enable patients and their healthcare providers to control both acute and delayed cinv for several days following chemotherapy with a single intravenous dose 
we believe this single  fixed dose treatment is more convenient compared to other marketed ht 

receptor antagonists  which usually demand that patients adhere to an oral follow up therapy regimen for several days 
gliadel wafer for malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation and for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gliadel polifeprosan with carmustine implant wafer gliadel is a proprietary  targeted  site specific cancer chemotherapy product approved in the united states for the treatment of malignant glioma  a form of primary brain cancer  and for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gbm  a rapidly fatal form of malignant brain cancer 
gliadel  a biodegradable polymer wafer  is implanted into the cavity in the brain after a brain tumor is removed and gradually dissolves  delivering high concentrations of bcnu or carmustine  the active chemotherapeutic ingredient directly to the tumor site for an extended period of time 
this product minimizes exposure to bcnu throughout the body and reduces or alleviates many of the side effects associated with intravenous chemotherapy 
we estimate that there are approximately  cases of malignant glioma in the united states each year 
we acquired rights to gliadel when we acquired guilford in october product sales of gliadel for were million representing million from january through september  and from october through december 
product sales of gliadel for and were million and million  respectively 
in addition to the us  we have regulatory approval to market gliadel for use in patients with recurrent gbm in over countries 
during september  gliadel was granted expanded marketing authorization for use in newly diagnosed patients with high grade malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation in france  germany  greece  ireland  italy  netherlands  portugal  spain and the united kingdom 
we market  sell and distribute gliadel in these countries either directly  on a named patient basis under applicable law  or through distribution agreements with various european companies 
we have a right to the underlying technology for gliadel pursuant to a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology mit that requires us to pay annual royalties based on our net revenue from gliadel  as defined per the license agreement 
from january through september  guilford recognized approximately million in royalty expense pursuant to that agreement  and from october through december  we recognized million in royalty expense pursuant to that agreement 
our domestic patent protection for gliadel ends in august  however  during september  the fda notified guilford that gliadel is entitled to market exclusivity for the treatment of patients with malignant glioma undergoing primary surgical resection until february under applicable orphan drug laws 
salagen tablets we conceived  developed and market salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride salagen in the united states 
the fda granted us orphan drug status for salagen in as a treatment for the symptoms of xerostomia induced by radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients and in for the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sj gren s syndrome 
our orphan drug protection for salagen for the treatment of symptoms of radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients expired in march and our orphan drug protection for sj gren s syndrome expired in february in december  the fda approved a competitor s abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablet 
two additional andas were approved by the fda in the introduction of these competing  generic products has resulted in a significant decline of salagen sales from and sales of million and million  respectively  in the united states to sales of million 
we expect this decline to continue in as a result  we suspended promotion of salagen 
in december  we entered into a five year manufacturing  supply and distribution agreement for milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets  with purepac pharmaceutical co 
purepac  a subsidiary of alpharma  inc under the terms of this manufacturing  supply and distribution agreement  we will manufacture and supply milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets to purepac for exclusive distribution in the united states and we will receive the supply price and a portion of gross margin of sales by purepac 
for the year ended december   we received million in revenues related to this agreement 
hexalen capsules for ovarian cancer in november  we purchased worldwide rights to hexalen altretamine capsules hexalen from medimmune oncology  inc hexalen is an orally administered chemotherapy that is approved as a second line treatment of ovarian cancer 
hexalen is approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in countries including the united states 
sales of hexalen in the united states were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
aggrastat injection guilford acquired the rights to aggrastat tirofiban hydrochloride injection aggrastat in the united states and its territories from merck in october aggrastat is a glycoprotein gp iib iiia receptor antagonist that is indicated for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome acs  including patients who are to be medically managed and those who are to undergo percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or atherectomy 
acs includes unstable angina  which is characterized by chest pain when one is at rest  and non st elevation myocardial infarction 
aggrastat blocks the ability of platelets to aggregate  thereby inhibiting the formation of blood clots and reducing the potential for cardiac ischemia 
sales of aggrastat in the united states were million in representing million from january through september  and million from october through december 
product sales for aggrastat for and were million and million  respectively 
kadian capsules for cancer pain in july  we entered into a three year promotion agreement for kadian capsules kadian  a sustained release formulation of morphine  with alpharma  inc under the terms of this promotion agreement  we promoted kadian in the united states to oncology health care professionals for moderate to severe pain associated with cancer 
effective december   we and alpharma  inc mutually agreed to end our co promotion agreement related to alpharma s kadian  a sustained release formulation of morphine sulfate 
alpharma retains all commercial rights to kadian 
revenues from this agreement  which was originally announced on september   were not material to our financial results during the period that this agreement was in effect 
no financial payments were associated with the termination of this agreement 
products under development dacogen injection overview in september  we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to the development  commercialization  manufacturing and distribution of dacogen decitabine injection dacogen for all indications from supergen  inc dacogen is an investigational anti cancer therapeutic which is currently in development for the treatment of patients with mds and aml 
a dacogen regulatory application for the treatment of mds is being reviewed for marketing approval by the fda in the united states 
a pivotal phase trial and two supporting phase trials for the mds indication forms the clinical basis of this application 
the fda has established may  as the pdufa action goal date for the nda 
an application before the european medicines agency emea in europe was withdrawn in november we are working with european regulatory authorities and intend a resubmission of the european application with confirmatory data from an ongoing eortc phase trial 
the anticancer activity of dacogen is due to both inhibition of cell growth  or cytotoxicity  which is observed at higher doses and decreasing methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid  or dna  which is predominately observed at lower doses 
decreasing dna methylation  or hypomethylation  is a relatively new approach to cancer treatment 
excess dna methylation has been implicated as a fundamental factor in the development of cancers 
researchers have determined that an increase in specific methylation of dna can result in blocking the expression of genes  such as tumor suppressor genes 
in clinical trials  researchers have demonstrated that dacogen can reverse the methylation of dna  potentially leading to re expression of tumor suppressor genes 
in clinical trials  dacogen has demonstrated activity in mds  aml  and chronic myeloid leukemia cml 
preclinical data suggest that dacogen may be effective in the treatment of solid tumor cancers where dna methylation status is believed to be important  such as melanoma  colon and ovarian cancer 
myelodysplastic syndrome mds is a bone marrow disorder characterized by bone marrow production of abnormally functioning  immature blood cells 
according to the american cancer society and the aplastic anemia mds international foundation  approximately  to  new cases of mds are diagnosed each year in the united states  although it is difficult to accurately determine the incidence because mds is not recorded by the national tumor registry in the united states 
in the majority of afflicted patients  mds results in death from bleeding and infection 
in approximately percent of patients  mds will convert to aml  a disease with a high mortality rate 
the phase trial was designed to support regulatory approval of dacogen for the treatment of patients with mds 
dacogen received orphan drug designation for mds in the united states and europe  which may provide us with seven years of marketing exclusivity in the united states and ten years of marketing exclusivity in europe if dacogen is approved for treatment of mds by the respective regulatory authorities 
in september  we received an approvable letter for dacogen 
while an approvable letter is a significant step in the drug approval process  approval from the fda is still required to market the product 
in november  we submitted an approvable letter response to the fda 
in december  we received a letter from the fda stating that our response to the approvable letter was complete and a pdufa date of may  had been established 
the pdufa date is the date by which the fda aims to render a decision on a new drug application 
also in november  we withdrew our marketing authorization application maa with the emea 
we will continue to work with the european regulatory authorities and intend a resubmission of the maa with confirmatory data from an ongoing eortc phase trial 
in may  vidaza azacitidine  marketed by pharmion corporation  was approved by the fda as the first drug to be approved for the treatment of mds 
in december  the fda approved lenalidomide for treatment of patients categorized as low or intermediate risk mds patients 
initial shipments of lenalidomide commenced in early if dacogen is also approved for treatment of mds  it will compete directly with azacitidine and lenalidomide 
other potential indications beyond the activity of dacogen for mds  we believe phase and trials demonstrate that dacogen may be active in a variety of other hematological malignancies such as aml and cml 
we began a phase trial of dacogen in aml patients in and we are currently conducting a multi center phase trial with dacogen for the treatment of refractory cml in patients who have failed previous front line therapy 
phase results also suggest that dacogen may be useful for treatment of non malignant diseases such as sickle cell anemia  for which we are supplying dacogen to investigators for their phase clinical trials in this area of study 
dacogen received orphan drug designation from the fda for sickle cell anemia in september  which may provide seven years of marketing exclusivity in the united states if dacogen is approved by the fda for the treatment of sickle cell anemia 
further  the dacogen clinical and scientific program is the subject of a clinical research and development agreement crada with the national cancer institute nci 
pursuant to the crada  we will supply dacogen for pre clinical and clinical trials that will be managed by the nci and that will focus primarily on the treatment of solid tumors 
saforis powder for oral suspension saforis powder for oral suspension saforis is a late stage  proprietary formulation of glutamine  an amino acid that is critical to the repair of cellular damage 
in multiple clinical trials  saforis has been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of oral mucositis in patients being treated with mucotoxic cancer therapies for a variety of tumor types 
the only treatment currently available for oral mucositis is kepivance  marketed by amgen inc  approved by the fda in december for the treatment of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support 
during the fourth quarter of  a guidance meeting was held with the fda to discuss the saforis nda 
we expect to submit the nda for saforis in the second quarter of saforis was granted fast track designation from the fda in  a program designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of specific drug products intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need for such a condition 
oral mucositis oral mucositis is one of the most common dose limiting toxicities induced by mucotoxic cancer therapy both chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
estimates of the incidence of oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer range from in those receiving standard chemotherapy to in patients having bone marrow transplantation 
oral mucositis presents clinically as erythema and ulceration of the mucosa 
clinical symptoms typically appear to days after the administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy and persist for to weeks in immunocompetent patients 
the underlying damage  however  is sustained many days before clinical symptoms appear 
the most common sites for oral mucositis include the lips  the buccal and soft palate mucosa  the floor of the mouth  and the ventral surface of the tongue 
recent research indicates that the underlying pathophysiology of oral mucositis is the same regardless of the precipitating mucotoxic cancer therapy cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation 
a phase model of mucosal barrier injury has been proposed that characterizes the pathophysiologic progression resulting in oral mucositis initiation  upregulation and message generation  signaling and amplification  ulceration  and healing 
clinically significant oral mucositis world health organization who grade is associated with ulceration  pain  difficulty swallowing  risks for impaired nutrition related to the inability to eat  and significantly higher rates of infection leading to hospitalization and death 
utilization of health care resources is directly linked to the incidence  severity and duration of oral mucositis  involving increased use of opiate analgesics  iv fluids  and antimicrobial agents 
glutamine glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid that can be synthesized by virtually all tissues in the body 
glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human plasma and the total amino acid pool and has multiple functions in the human body  including the nitrogen transfer between tissues  energy production  and regulation of nucleic acid and protein synthesis 
glutamine is critical in times of serious illness when tissue repair is necessary or when there are high levels of cell replication 
when such increased demands occur  the requirements for glutamine can exceed production  and exogenous superficial tissue glutamine is needed to maintain normal plasma and tissue concentrations 
the rapidly dividing cells of the oral mucosa use glutamine not only as the primary fuel but also as the nitrogen source for cellular repair and anabolic functions 
thus  the availability of endogenous deep tissue and exogenous glutamine becomes critical when the mucosa has been injured as a result of chemotherapy or radiotherapy 
glutamine is moderately soluble and highly labile in most physiologic environments 
topical delivery of glutamine to the oral mucosa has previously been limited by these and other factors and by widespread metabolism throughout the body 
the most critical of the treatment limiting factors is the delivery of adequate amounts of glutamine from the oral cavity to the interior of the mucosal cells 
saforis and oral mucositis saforis  with its proprietary uptec delivery system  facilitates mucosal cell uptake of glutamine by more than fold over that of glutamine without the uptec delivery system 
saforis enhances the uptake of glutamine in epithelial  endothelial  and fibroblast cells 
clinically  saforis reduces the damaging effects of cancer treatment and facilitates tissue repair in the oral mucosa  thereby preventing or reducing the incidence and or duration of oral mucositis 
aquavan injection aquavan fospropofol disodium injection aquavan is a novel sedative hypnotic product candidate that is a water soluble prodrug of a widely used anesthetic  propofol 
we are currently evaluating aquavan for use as a minimal to moderate sedative during brief diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures during which patients are lethargic  but are responsive to stimulation and able to maintain their airways 
moderate sedation is generally used in non invasive procedures lasting under two hours  including  for example  various endoscopy or bronchoscopy procedures  cardiac procedures  biopsies  insertions or removals of lines  tubes or catheters and other minor surgical procedures 
we concluded a randomized  double blind  multi center phase dose ranging trial in the fourth quarter of a pivotal program will be undertaken in utilizing an initial dose of milligrams per kilogram of body weight that will be designed to serve as the basis for fda registration 
we expect to submit an nda to the fda for the approval of aquavan for use in minimal to moderate sedation for brief diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in the first half of early clinical trials with aquavan  conducted by guilford  evaluated its use in connection with elective colonoscopy  bronchoscopy  cardiac catheterization and minor surgical procedures 
guilford conducted four phase clinical studies in europe in healthy volunteers  one phase clinical study in the united states and a phase clinical trial of aquavan in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery 
in november  guilford announced the results of a phase adaptive dose ranging study that evaluated aquavan when used in combination with fentanyl citrate to provide moderate sedation in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy 
the analysis of this trial demonstrated that aquavan provided rapid onset and rapid recovery from sedation in a convenient dosing regimen and was without serious adverse effects 
subsequently  five phase trials were initiated using a fixed weight based dose of aquavan with a weight based pre treatment dose of fentanyl 
one study in colonoscopy was completed while the other four were stopped early 
the results of these studies indicated that a fixed weigh based dosing regimen put patients at too deep a level of sedation 
guilford met with the fda in april and received an spa for a phase does ranging study that utilized a titration based dosing regimen 
guilford originally licensed the rights to aquavan injection from proquest pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held pharmaceutical company based in kansas  in in the fourth quarter of  guilford acquired proquest  thereby obtaining an irrevocable  royalty free  fully paid  exclusive  worldwide license to the intellectual property rights for aquavan from the university of kansas 
aloxi injection for the prevention of ponv aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection aloxi is a potent  highly selective serotonin subtype  or ht  receptor antagonist differentiated by its strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life and has already been approved for the prevention of cinv 
helsinn healthcare  the licensor of palonosetron hydrochloride  is conducting phase trials with a goal to seek fda approval of aloxi for the prevention of ponv 
a special protocol assessment spa was agreed to with the fda and phase trials began in we expect enrollment to be completed in ponv is a common consequence of anesthetic and surgical procedures 
patients undergoing abdominal  gynecological  ear  nose and throat  cardiovascular  and eye surgery are at the highest risk for ponv 
if not prevented  ponv can delay discharge from the medical facility  cause hospital re admissions and increase healthcare costs for patients who undergo surgery 
we believe that the united states market for the use of ht receptor antagonists in ponv is approximately million 
aloxi oral capsule formulation for the prevention of cinv helsinn healthcare is evaluating an oral aloxi capsule aloxi capsules to offer patients and their caregivers a choice of formulations that may provide protection from both acute and delayed cinv 
the aloxi capsules are currently being evaluated in a phase clinical trial that is expected to complete enrollment by the end of we estimate that the peak sales potential for all aloxi formulations in the cinv indication could exceed million in the us depending upon market penetration and acceptance 
amolimogene hpv e e plasmid formerly known as zyca the goal of treatment with amolimogene hpv e e plasmid is to enhance the natural immune response of a patient infected with human papillomavirus hpv by allowing the body to produce a substance that is seen as foreign  an hpv antigen  which results in a heightened immune system response to hpv in the patient 
the enhanced immune response  in the form of activated cells  is expected to recognize and eliminate the patient s abnormal growth of cervical tissue  or cervical dysplasia 
amolimogene hpv e e plasmid is a circular form of double strand dna  or plasmid dna  contained within biodegradable poly lactide co glycolide  or plg  microparticles 
this microencapsulation based formulation of amolimogene hpv e e plasmid facilitates uptake of plasmid dna by certain antigen presenting cells apcs 
the plasmid dna is used to produce a protein  fragments of which attach to carrier molecules 
this complex migrates to the surface of the apc and is recognized by thymus derived cells t cells specific for hpv 
these t cells  representing an enhanced immune response  migrate to the cervix and eliminate the hpv positive disease causing cells  thereby enabling the patient to heal 
we are currently developing amolimogene hpv e e plasmid as a treatment for young women with high grade cervical dysplasia 
a phase  multicenter  randomized placebo controlled trial of women with high grade cervical dysplasia was conducted in the united states and europe 
patients enrolled in this phase trial received an intramuscular injection of amolimogene hpv e e plasmid every three weeks for a total of three doses 
amolimogene hpv e e plasmid was shown to be safe and well tolerated 
in a prospectively defined cohort of patients under years of age  the drug promoted resolution of high grade dysplasia in percent of patients  versus percent in the placebo arm 
in all patients  resolution was percent for patients on drug and percent for patients on placebo 
in other open label trials  the drug was found to be safe and well tolerated and disease resolution was observed in a high percentage of young patients 
the most frequently observed adverse event in these trials was mild to moderate injection site pain  which was manageable with over the counter analgesics 
the first trial in a two part pivotal program to further assess the safety and efficacy of amolimogene hpv e e plasmid began in and was designed to become a key part of submissions to regulatory authorities for seeking marketing approval 
we expect to complete enrollment in and a second phase trial is planned to commence at the conclusion of the first trial 
human papillomavirus and cervical dysplasia overview hpv refers to a group of viruses that includes more than different types 
more than of these viruses are sexually transmitted and can infect the genital area 
the areas include the skin of the penis  vulva  or anus  and the lining of the vagina  cervix  and rectum 
most people who become infected with hpv will not have any symptoms  and the infection will resolve on its own 
in the united states  approximately million people are currently infected with hpv 
at least percent of sexually active men and women acquire genital hpv infection at some point in their lives 
it is estimated that as many as percent of women have had hpv or are currently infected by hpv and that by age  at least percent will have acquired genital hpv infection 
hpv is the cause of cervical dysplasia 
the three types of cervical dysplasia also called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cin are mild  or cin  moderate  or cin  and severe  or cin mild dysplasia is by far the most common type 
mild dysplasia is not considered to be a true pre cancerous disease by many experts  because in about percent of cases the abnormal cervical tissue heals and is replaced by normal tissue over time without any specific medical intervention 
however  in a subset of women  mild dysplasia can progress to a more serious disease 
often  moderate and severe types of cervical dysplasia  or cin  are grouped together and called high grade cervical dysplasia 
a diagnosis of cin is based upon cellular changes  or transformation  that leads to sufficiently abnormal cervical cell replication and the generation of a cervical lesion that is deemed a pre cancerous condition 
this diagnosis requires that women be treated to eliminate the lesion and the causative transformed cells  which have the potential to develop into cervical cancer over a long period of time 
cin lesions are generally treated by a surgical excision procedure called the loop electrocautery excisional procedure leep 
this surgical and other cin treatments are associated with efficacy rates of percent to percent 
however  these procedures are invasive and can cause a number of short term and long term side effects 
leep places women at risk because it is a surgical procedure and can result in complications such as bleeding  a narrowing of the cervical opening  cervical incompetence  loss of mucous glands  and secondary infertility 
there are two companies developing prophylactic hpv vaccines for the prevention of cervical carcinoma 
it is anticipated that the first hpv vaccine will receive regulatory approval by end of current data suggests that the efficacy of these vaccines is limited to preventing cervical cancer associated with hpv and these ciral types account for of cervical carcinoma and of cin if these vaccines are approved by the fda  they will not compete directly with amolimogene hpv e e plasmid  but over time they may erode the size of the cin market 
zyc our second immunotherapy compound in clinical development is zyc zyc  an encapsulated plasmid encoding a commonly expressed tumor antigen  has completed a phase a trial in patients with late stage metastatic hematological and solid tumors 
the enzyme cytochrome p b cypb  is encoded by the zyc plasmid 
data from this trial were selected for oral presentation at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting and demonstrated that zyc was well tolerated and biologically active 
during  we plan to begin a clinical trial in patients with solid tumors to further assess the safety and efficacy of zyc the immune system and zyc recent studies  in both human and animal systems  have provided compelling evidence that the immune system can be activated to specifically recognize human tumor cells and kill them 
most attention has focused on t cells as the principal cause of anti tumor immunity especially in light of findings that tumor derived proteins function as tumor associated antigens taa and targets for t cells 
the demonstration that taa specific immune responses can lead to tumor regression has been borne out extensively in animal models and data from clinical trials suggest that this approach is safe  feasible  and potentially effective in humans 
until recently  clinical efforts have been somewhat limited  in part because most tumor antigens are restricted in expression to one or a few tumor types and to a fraction of subjects with these types of tumors 
cypb  the enzyme encoded in the zyc plasmid  is widely expressed in human cancer but rarely in normal tissues 
administration of zyc in preclinical studies resulted in anti tumor t cell responses and results from preclinical toxicity studies warranted clinical development 
a phase a clinical trial in subjects with advanced malignancies who had failed prior cancer treatments was conducted to test the safety  bioactivity and clinical activity of zyc each patient was administered zyc intramuscularly every other week for the target number of at least but not more than doses at a fixed dose level 
from a safety perspective  zyc was well tolerated 
with the exception of a single subject who experienced abscesses at the injection site  no systemic or local toxicity was considered related to treatment with zyc  and only mild to moderate localized injection site reactions were observed 
from a bioactivity perspective  despite their advanced cancer stage and history of prior chemotherapy treatment  many patients were determined to have an immune response to zyc increased levels of cypb  or biologic responses  were observed in percent of patients who received more than doses and in percent of the patients receiving doses of zyc from a clinical activity perspective  patients had stable disease following their last dose of zyc and all other patients had progressive disease 
each of the patients who had disease stabilization was an immune responder 
durable clinical response to subsequent chemotherapy was all patients who earlier had demonstrated a biologic response to zyc  including complete response that lasted more than twelve months 
only one of the eleven non biologic responders benefited from subsequent chemotherapy 
in summary  the data support proceeding with additional clinical development of zyc irofulven for chemotherapy treatment of cancer irofulven is a cancer therapy product candidate under development and is part of our family of proprietary cancer therapy compounds called acylfulvenes 
acylfulvenes  including irofulven  are semi synthetic derivatives of the natural product illudin s obtained from the omphalotus olearius mushroom 
we licensed rights to the entire class of acylfulvene agents  including irofulven  from the regents of the university of california in mechanism of action studies have indicated that irofulven is rapidly taken up by sensitive tumor cell types where it reacts with tumor cell dna and protein targets in a novel manner  producing rapid inhibition of dna synthesis and dna lesions that are difficult for the tumor cell to repair 
the initiation of dna damage by irofulven begins a tumor selective cascade of cellular events that ultimately causes cell death  or apoptosis 
clinical trials will determine whether the differential effect of irofulven on tumor cells compared to healthy cells translates into important clinical benefit 
we further believe that irofulven could be the first of a series of acylfulvene analogs that merit development as cancer therapies 
we believe irofulven has a unique mechanism of action that makes it well suited for study in refractory patient populations and in combination with other cancer therapies 
preclinical data and clinical data demonstrate irofulven s activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other therapies 
preclinical studies have also demonstrated the additive or synergistic effect of irofulven with a number of marketed cancer therapies 
therefore  we believe that pursuing development paths in refractory cancers and in combination with other cancer therapies is warranted 
preclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs and initial clinical data from the dosing of over  cancer patients with irofulven have demonstrated that irofulven is adequately tolerated as a chemotherapeutic compound and its side effects are reversible 
the primary dose limiting side effect has been bone marrow suppression  usually observed as decreased blood platelet or white cell counts 
other drug related side effects have been nausea  vomiting  visual disturbances and fatigue 
bone marrow suppression has been controlled through dose adjustments or treatment delays to allow recovery of platelet or white cell counts 
nausea and vomiting are prophylactically controlled with standard  currently available treatments 
visual disturbances and fatigue are managed by dose adjustments and are generally reversible after discontinuation of treatment 
to obtain marketing approval for irofulven in the united states  pivotal registration trials would need to be successfully completed and submitted to the fda 
phase trials typically use survival as the primary endpoint  compared to a randomly determined control group and have a higher number of enrolled patients than in earlier phases 
irofulven single agent trials we conducted single agent phase dose ranging trials using daily and intermittent weekly administration of irofulven to determine recommended dose amounts for subsequent trials 
late stage cancer patients who were refractory to other chemotherapies enrolled in these trials and clinical activity was demonstrated in addition to determining dose amount and schedule for subsequent trials 
based on these results  we tested irofulven in a variety of phase solid tumor trials 
we initially chose to investigate prostate  liver  ovary and pancreas cancers because anti cancer activity of irofulven has been observed in each of these trials  including objective tumor shrinkage 
irofulven combination trials we believe that an advantage of combination therapy is the potential to achieve enhanced anti cancer benefit with an acceptable side effect profile compared to either agent used alone 
because irofulven has a unique mechanism of action  retains activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other cancer therapies and in preclinical trials demonstrated additive or synergistic effects in combination with a number of marketed chemotherapies  we are conducting drug combination trials with irofulven 
the first clinical step in exploring combination therapy is to conduct phase  dose ranging trials to determine the maximum tolerated dose of both drugs together 
we have completed phase trials of irofulven in combination with each of irinotecan  cisplatin  docetaxel  capecitabine  gemcitabine and oxaliplatin 
phase trials of irofulven in combination with other chemotherapies  such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin are ongoing 
other acylfulvene analogs in addition to irofulven  we have obtained license rights to acylfulvene analogs 
the synthesis and the initial biological testing of over of these analogs has been performed at the university of california  san diego ucsd 
at ucsd  both in vitro and in vivo anti tumor activity has been demonstrated for a significant number of the acylfulvene analogs 
further in vitro and in vivo testing of some of these analogs by the nci and by us has confirmed potent  broad spectrum anti tumor activity 
the broad spectrum anti tumor activity of the acylfulvene analogs suggests that this class of compounds has the potential to produce additional clinical development candidates 
we are currently evaluating selected analogs for further preclinical development 
gcp ii inhibitor compounds n acetylated alpha linked acid dipeptidase naaladase  also known as glutamate carboxypeptidase ii gcp ii  is a membrane bound enzyme found in the central and peripheral nervous system and is believed to play a role in modulating the release of glutamate  one of the brain s most common chemical messengers 
during conditions of acute injury or chronic disease  there may be a large increase in the release of glutamate that incites a cascade of biochemical events  ultimately leading to cell injury or death 
our gcp ii inhibitor program is aimed at developing a commercial drug to block excessive glutamate release 
our gcp ii inhibitors appear to normalize pain sensitivity  attenuate nerve conduction deficits and prevent histopathological degeneration in several animal models of diabetic and chemotherapy induced neuropathy and neuropathic pain 
we are currently pursuing the development of gpi  one of our gcp ii inhibitor compounds that has completed a single phase clinical trial  for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neuropathy 
parp inhibitor compounds poly adp ribose polymerase parp  is an abundant nuclear enzyme that plays a significant role in facilitating dna repair and maintaining genomic integrity 
in cancer treatment  parp activity is believed to enable tumor cells to counteract the chemotherapy and radiation therapy by repairing the resulting dna damage 
in animal testing  parp inhibition enhances the activity of radiotherapy as well as a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents 
in ischemia  over activation of parp mediates necrosis by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate 
in animal testing  parp inhibition provides neuroprotection in stroke and myocardial ischemia models 
we have synthesized several families of potent small molecule parp inhibitors 
recently  two candidate compounds were selected for clinical development 
both are orally bioavailable  highly brain penetrable and increase the efficacy of various chemotherapies in preclinical cancer models 
gpi history of gpi gpi is an investigational new drug that belongs to a class of small molecule compounds called neuroimmunophilin ligands nils 
scientists from johns hopkins university jhu discovered that commonly used immunosuppressive drugs can promote nerve growth 
guilford licensed patent rights relating to this research from jhu and as a result of this basic research discovered gpi and many other proprietary nils 
in pre clinical experiments  these nils were shown to repair and regenerate damaged nerves without affecting normal  healthy nerves 
current clinical status guilford initiated a phase clinical study of gpi in parkinson s disease in november  following the termination of a corporate partnership with amgen that tested gpi for the same indications but did not meet its primary endpoint 
the trial was designed to detect the loss of dopamine transporters 
during the first quarter of  guilford began a second phase clinical trial studying the use of gpi this trial was conducted in patients undergoing a nerve sparing prostatectomy  because gpi showed efficacy in pre clinical and animal models of post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction pped 
the parkinson s trial was concluded and the pped trial analysis will be evaluated in july in march  we were advised by symphony neuro development company sndc  the licensee of gpi and the sponsor of the trials  that the parkinson s disease trial failed to meet its primary endpoint 
symphony neuro development company in june  guilford licensed its rights in the united states to gpi to sndc in the following four disease states parkinson s disease  traumatic nerve injury  including pped  hiv related peripheral neuropathy and hiv related dementia 
sndc agreed to invest up to million to advance gpi through its current clinical programs in those disease states 
in addition  guilford issued to sndc s investors five year warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at per share 
when we acquired guilford  these warrants became warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
sndc s investors granted guilford an exclusive option to purchase sndc 
due to our acquisition of guilford  we may exercise this option at our sole discretion until march   at an exercise price of million as of december   and incrementally increasing to million by march if we exercise the option  we will regain the rights that we licensed to sndc 
we have concluded that we will not exercise the option 
while the clinical trials with gpi were ongoing  we provided certain product development services to rrd international  llc rrd  the manager of the clinical trials for sndc 
under this arrangement  we provided sndc with manufacturing  process development  toxicology  patent and regulatory affairs services 
during  we and guilford were reimbursed million for this work by sndc representing million reimbursed during prior to our acquisition of guilford and million reimbursed to us subsequent to the acquisition 
we expect to provide only minimal services to sndc under this arrangement during the remainder of  as sndc completes activities related to the trials 
dopascan injection dopascan injection dopascan is a product candidate that is intended to measure dopamine transporter binding to diagnose and monitor the degree of parkinson s disease  a disease that affects more than one million patients in the united states 
dopascan is administered to patients intravenously and allows an attending physician to obtain images and measure the density of dopamine transporters in the patient s brain  which are highly concentrated in a specialized area of the brain and which are significantly decreased in patients with parkinson s disease 
we license exclusive patent rights to dopascan from the research triangle institute rti in research triangle park  north carolina 
we currently do not have a clinical development program for dopascan in the united states  and therefore do not expect to be applying to the fda to market and sell dopascan 
we have international development partners that are currently conducting research 
mg and small molecule dna methyltransferase inhibitor programs in august  as part of our strategy to expand our portfolio of marketed and development stage anti cancer products  we entered into an exclusive license  research and development agreement with methylgene inc methylgene for north america rights to its proprietary anti cancer product candidate mg and methylgene s dna methyltransferase small molecule inhibitor program 
included within our license rights is a united states patent on a method for reversing the tumor causing state of a cell by administering an agent that corrects an aberrant methylation pattern in the dna of the cell 
in amendments to the license agreement with methylgene  they acknowledged full satisfaction of our then current payment obligations and suspended further payment obligations by us pending completion by methylgene of a planned clinical trial with mg rights to the small molecule inhibitor program have reverted back to methylgene 
if we resume mg development  our financial responsibilities related to mg under the license agreement with them would also resume 
sales and marketing we believe that for successful commercialization of our products  our commercial management group  including the sales and marketing functions  must be integrated from the moment we identify a product candidate for possible acquisition and development 
in this manner  factors that are important throughout the entire life cycle of a product can be appropriately managed 
from initial sales forecasting  to market research  to brand strategy  to advocate development  our commercial development function prepares our product candidates for transition to our product marketing group 
our marketing group is responsible for additional market research  brand strategy and tactics  marketing programs  design and production of promotional materials and analysis of market performance 
we use a variety of marketing programs to reach our targeted audiences  including distribution of product specific brochures in face to face meetings and direct mailings  exhibits at select medical meetings and journal advertising 
in addition  preparations are underway for a targeted direct to consumer advertising campaign for aloxi for cinv 
this direct to consumer advertising campaign is planned to roll out in the second quarter of we currently promote our products in the united states using our person oncology focused sales organization and our person acute care focused sales organization 
specifically  these promotion activities are directed to physician specialists  plus associated nurses  pharmacists  practice managers and support staff 
as is common in the pharmaceutical industry  our domestic product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers  including specialty oncology distributors  for further distribution to the ultimate consumers of our products 
we had three customers  oncology supply  mckesson drug otn  and us oncology specialty  who each individually accounted for more than percent of our revenue in in total  these three customers accounted for percent of our revenue 
we use international collaborations to develop and or commercialize our products outside the united states 
we describe those collaborations below in the section entitled international research  development and commercialization agreements 
research and development we maintain active drug development programs for our product candidates and commercialized products 
current drug development efforts are primarily focused on dacogen  aquavan  amolimogene hpv e e plasmid  saforis  irofulven and aloxi products 
earlier stage drug candidates  zyc  gpi  and parp inhibitors  are also being developed internally 
we also participate in post marketing trials to support the continued commercialization of our marketed products and we seek product candidate acquisitions in order to expand our development pipeline 
with the mgi biologics formerly known as zycos  inc and mgi gp acquisitions  we have expanded our research and development capabilities to include biologics the zycos platform and small molecule parp  gcp ii programs capabilities 
this will add the competencies of targeted basic research and traditional drug discovery activities to our research and development organization 
it is our intent to focus our research in a disciplined manner to control our expenses and mitigate the risk due to product failure 
currently we employed associates in research and development  which includes associates in research and associates in development activities 
we have incurred significant research and development costs in the past and believe that substantial capital resources will be required to support current and future development programs 
we spent approximately million in  million in  and million in on research and development 
for the years ended december    and  percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our research and development expense was attributable to license milestone payments 
funding for research and development is expected to come from internally generated funds  joint ventures  strategic alliances or other sources of capital  including equity or debt offerings 
successful drug development requires a broad spectrum of scientific  clinical and product development expertise 
as part of our strategy  we conduct research directed towards the lifecycle management of drugs and drug candidates in our current pipeline  as well as research focused on drug candidates that will address areas of defined medical need in the areas of oncology and acute care 
we believe this combined approach will substantially increase our profitability margins in the long term and reduces risk related to early stage drug discovery in the short term 
we manage the clinical development of product candidates by selectively outsourcing certain activities 
we have in house targeted research  preclinical  clinical  product and formulation development  data management  biostatistics  medical writing  safety  quality and regulatory capabilities  which allows us to manage clinical trials  monitor adverse drug experience reporting  and file new drug applications with regulatory bodies 
we outsource other development activities  such as certain laboratory projects  conduct of certain preclinical studies  production of clinical supplies and certain aspects of clinical trial conduct 
we expect to continue to contract with third parties until it is necessary and economical to add these capabilities internally

the term of a us patent issued from an application filed before june  is the longer of years from its issue date or years from its effective filing date 
the term of a us patent issuing from an application filed on or after june  is years from its effective filing date 
the drug price and competition and patent term restoration act of  the generic animal drug act  and the patent term restoration act generally provide that a patent relating to  among other items  a human drug product  may be extended for a period of up to five years by the us commissioner of patents and trademarks if the patented item was subject to regulatory review by the fda before the item was marketed commonly referred to as a hatch waxman extension 
under these acts  a product s regulatory review period which consists generally of the period from the time when the exemption to permit clinical investigations becomes effective until the fda grants marketing approval for the product forms the basis for determining the length of the extension an applicant may receive 
in addition  a patent term can be extended for an additional six months in the us if the applicant performs additional testing in the pediatric population  as requested by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the term of any issued patents will be extended 
in addition  no grant of patent term extension will prevent a challenge to the underlying patent s validity or a judicial finding that the underlying patent infringes on the rights of any third party 
patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues 
therefore  although we believe our patents are valid  we cannot predict with any precision the scope or enforceability of the claims 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents  that issued patents will provide an adequate measure of protection against competitive technology which could circumvent such patents  or that issued patents would withstand review and be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that infringement of any issued patents cannot be circumvented by others 
orphan drugs are currently provided seven years of marketing exclusivity for an approved indication following approval to market by the fda  and are provided ten years of marketing exclusivity for an approved indication following approval to market by the emea 
orphan drug designation for our products does not  however  insulate us from other manufacturers attempting to develop an alternate drug for the designated indication  or the designated drug for another  separate indication 
we also rely on trade secrets and continuing innovation that we seek to protect with reasonable business procedures for maintaining trade secrets  including confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise be known or be independently discovered by competitors 
in addition to the patents which form the basis of the pharmaceutical focus of this company  we also own four us patents which claim maize plants that are resistant to certain herbicides and that also claim methods for producing such resistant plants 
these patents were issued between and while these patents have been licensed to basf originally licensed to american cyanamid  we may still incur expenses associated with any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings related to these patents

many members of the industry have greater resources than we do  providing them with potentially greater flexibility in developing and marketing their products 
while we will seek to protect our products from direct competition through filing patents  seeking marketing exclusivity under the orphan drug act  and maintaining technical information as trade secrets  there is no way to protect us from competition from products with different chemical composition or products made using different technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our plan to gain product specific protection for each of our pharmaceuticals or that developments by others will not render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
aloxi is the fourth ht antagonist approved for marketing in the united states 
further  there is no certainty that the patent protection afforded palonosetron hydrochloride will be effective in keeping generic equivalents from entering the market 
patent protection for zofran ondansetron  a major competing product  will expire in this will allow for the introduction of a generic ht inhibitor  which could affect sales of all branded ht inhibitors including aloxi 
at the end of  it is anticipated that generic kytril granisetron may be available 
with respect to gliadel  we are aware of several competing approaches for the treatment of malignant glioma  including traditional systemic chemotherapy  radioactive seeds  radiation catheters  temodar capsules  which is a chemotherapy product manufactured by schering corporation and other experimental protocols 
furthermore  our patent protection for gliadel ends in august the fda has granted us market exclusivity for marketing gliadel for malignant glioma at the time of initial surgery until february regardless  after august when our patent protection expires  others may try to copy the wafer and enter the market as a generic drug through applicable fda procedures 
in may  vidaza azacitidine was approved by the fda as the first drug to be approved for the treatment of mds 
in december  the fda also approved lenalidomide for treatment of patients categorized as low or intermediate risk mds patients 
initial shipments of lenalidomide commenced in early if dacogen is also approved for treatment of mds  it will compete directly with azacitidine and lenalidomide 
competition in the markets for salagen intensified during because  beginning in december  generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets entered the united states markets where salagen competes 
the introduction of these competing  generic products has resulted in a significant decline of salagen sales from sales of million in the united states to sales of million 
we expect a continued decline in the sales of salagen in as a result of competing  generic products  we suspended direct promotion of salagen 
with respect to aggrastat  there are two other competing gp iib iiia inhibitors integrilin injection integrilin and reopro abciximab 
reopro  marketed by eli lilly  was the first gp iib iiia inhibitor to come to market and is used predominantly at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention pci 
currently  integrilin  marketed in the us through schering plough corporation  has a broader indication than reopro  allowing integrilin to be used both at the time of pci as well as prior to pci 
in some medical institutions  angiomax  an antithrombin  is being used as a replacement for iib iiia inhibitors in pci but that use is generally limited to low risk and elective pci patients 
hexalen is approved in the united states for the treatment of ovarian cancer in patients with persistent or recurrent disease following first line therapy with certain other chemotherapies 
other chemotherapies are also used for second line treatment of ovarian cancer and are marketed by pharmaceutical companies with greater resources than we have 
further  competitors could develop and introduce generic drugs that are comparable to hexalen 
many companies of all sizes  including large pharmaceutical companies as well as specialized biotechnology companies  are developing cancer therapy drugs that will compete with our product candidates under development  if any of them are approved for sale 
there are also a number of products already on the market that will compete directly with our product candidates if any of them are approved 
in addition  colleges  universities  governmental agencies and other public and private research institutions will continue to conduct research and may develop new therapies or treatments which would render our drug candidates obsolete or non competitive 
many of our competitors also have substantially greater financial  research and development  human and other resources than we do 
government regulation our research and marketing activities are subject to significant regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
pharmaceutical products intended for therapeutic use in humans are governed by fda regulations in the united states and by comparable regulations in foreign countries 
the process of completing clinical testing and obtaining fda approval for a new drug product requires a number of years and the expenditure of substantial resources without any assurance that approval for marketing will be granted 
the fda has established mandatory procedures to regulate the manufacturing and testing process regarding the identity  strength  quality and purity of a product 
following initial formulation  the steps required before any new prescription pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an ind  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  submission of an nda and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale 
preclinical studies are conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain information on the drug s efficacy  mode of action  and to identify any significant safety problems 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
testing in humans may commence days after the ind has been filed unless the fda issues a clinical hold 
additional animal studies may be performed throughout the development process 
a three phase clinical program is usually required for fda approval of a pharmaceutical product  unless accelerated approval is granted 
phase clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety profile  including the safe dosage range  metabolism and pharmacologic action of the product  and  if possible  to gain early evidence on efficacy 
although most phase trials are conducted with healthy volunteers  phase cancer trials are conducted with cancer patients 
following establishment of a safe dose from phase trials  a phase clinical program is conducted for dose ranging and to assess the safety and efficacy of the product in patients with the disease being studied 
phase confirmatory clinical trials are conducted on patients more representative of the intended patient population in terms of medical treatment  age groups  gender and ethnicity 
data from the larger phase program is to provide adequate statistical evidence of safety and efficacy necessary to evaluate the overall benefit and risk relationship in the target patient population 
phase and phase trials are usually multi center trials in order to achieve greater statistical validity and to have data from a broader patient population that is more representative of the intended patient group 
phase  or post approval trials  may be required under accelerated approval or to provide additional data on safety or efficacy of the product 
upon completion of clinical testing  and with data successfully demonstrating that the product is safe and effective for a specific indication  an nda or biologics license application bla for biologics products may be filed with the fda 
the nda or bla contains all the scientific evidence including product formulation  manufacturing  control information  preclinical and clinical data 
fda approval of the nda or bla is required before the applicant may market the new product 
even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further trials may be required to provide additional data on safety or efficacy for current indications  or to obtain approval for uses other than those for which the product was initially approved 
moreover  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a drug may be marketed 
even if fda approval is obtained  there can be no assurance of commercial success for any product 
post marketing testing may be required  and surveillance programs such as reporting adverse events are required 
the fda may require withdrawal of an approved product from the market if any significant safety issues arise while a product is being marketed 
in addition  before  during and after the process of approval  our prescription drug products must all be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices as set forth by the fda 
marketing of products is also regulated by the fda 
the orphan drug provisions of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act provide incentives to drug and biologics manufacturers to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions  currently defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the us or  for a disease or condition that affects more than  individuals in the us  where the sponsor does not realistically anticipate that revenue generated from sales of the product will exceed the cost of its development 
under these provisions  a manufacturer of a designated orphan product can seek tax benefits  and the holder of the first fda approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for that product for the orphan indication 
while the marketing exclusivity of an orphan drug would deter other sponsors from obtaining approval of the same compound for the same indication  it would not prevent other types of drugs from being approved for the same indication 
the health care industry is changing rapidly as the public  government  medical professionals and the pharmaceutical industry examine ways to broaden medical coverage while controlling health care costs 
potential approaches that may affect us include managed care initiatives  pharmaceutical buying groups  formulary requirements  and efforts to regulate the marketing and pricing of pharmaceutical products 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of together with rulemaking by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms require a number of changes in medicare practices  including reimbursement 
the changes made to date  are not expected to have an adverse effect on our operations or sales  but we cannot predict the impact  if any  of future reimbursement changes 
federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations do not materially effect our operations and we believe that we are currently in material compliance with such applicable laws and regulations

financial information prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  including information about revenues from customers and geographical areas  measures of profit and losses  and total assets  can be found in our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
item a 
risk factors sales of aloxi injection aloxi account for a significant portion of our product revenues 
our business is dependent on the commercial success of aloxi 
if any factor adversely affects sales of aloxi  we may be unable to continue our operations as planned 
the success of our business is dependent on the continued successful commercialization of aloxi 
aloxi sales represented percent and percent of our total product sales and and percent of our total revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
any factor adversely affecting sales of aloxi could cause our product revenues to decrease and our stock price to decline significantly 
aloxi is relatively new to the market  when compared to its competitors  and its long term acceptance by the oncology community will depend largely on our ability to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of aloxi as an alternative to other therapies 
we cannot be certain that aloxi will provide benefits considered adequate by providers of oncology services or that enough providers will use the product to ensure its continued commercial success 
patent protection for injectable zofran ondansetron  a major competing product  will expire in this will allow for the generic ht inhibitors  which could negatively affect sales of all branded ht inhibitors including aloxi 
the food and drug administration fda subjects an approved product and its manufacturer to continual regulatory review 
after approval and use in an increasing number of patients  the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  such as unacceptable toxicities or side effects  may result in restrictions or sanctions on the product or manufacturer that could affect the commercial viability of the product or could require withdrawal of the product from the market 
further  we must continually submit any labeling  advertising and promotional material to the fda for review 
there is risk that the fda will prohibit use of the marketing material in the form we desire 
unfavorable outcomes resulting from factors such as those identified above could limit sales of aloxi or cause sales of aloxi to decline 
in those circumstances  our stock price would decline and we would have to find additional sources of funding or scale back or cease operations 
we have a history of net losses 
if we do not have net income in the future  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we expect to incur significant expenses over the next several years as we devote substantial resources to support of the development efforts of aloxi products through milestone payments to helsinn  such as aloxi for post operative nausea and vomiting ponv and aloxi oral for cinv aloxi capsules  the continued development of other product candidates  including aquavan injection aquavan  amolimogene hpv e e plasmid formerly known as zyca  saforis powder for oral suspension saforis  dacogen injection dacogen and irofulven  continued commercialization of aloxi  gliadel wafer gliadel  and our other marketed products and acquire additional product candidates or companies 
therefore  we may not generate net income on a consistent basis  or at all  unless we are able to significantly increase sales of aloxi  gliadel  or other products compared to our current sales  and or significantly reduce the funding for our research and development programs or commercial operations 
in addition to aloxi  to a more limited extent we will also depend on maintaining or increasing revenues from gliadel  the failure of which would have an adverse effect on our ability to accomplish our business objectives 
prior to february  the fda had only approved the marketing of gliadel in the united states for patients who had a brain tumor surgically removed and had recurrent forms of a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme gbm  affecting approximately  to  patients annually 
in february  the fda granted approval to also market gliadel for patients undergoing initial surgery  also known as first line therapy  in the united states for malignant glioma in conjunction with surgery and radiation 
our ability to increase sales of gliadel will depend upon achieving greater market penetration among gbm patients and successful marketing of gliadel for first line therapy 
even if we increase our sales and marketing efforts  such increases may not result in increased sales of gliadel 
if gliadel fails to gain broader market acceptance for gbm patients or as first line therapy  the revenues we receive from sales of gliadel would be unlikely to increase 
sales of our salagen tablets salagen in the united states are likely to continue to decline significantly for subsequent periods because generic pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets were introduced into the united states in december beginning in december  generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets entered the united states markets where salagen competes 
sales of salagen declined significantly in to million from our sales of million in the united states 
due to competition from these generics  and as a result of the cessation of our marketing efforts of salagen  we expect revenues from salagen to continue to decrease 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect our stock price 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  our stock price may decline 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors including the acceptance of  and demand for  aloxi  changing demand for our other products  including gliadel  approval by the fda for dacogen  third parties introducing competing products  announcements regarding the results of events relating to or results of the clinical trials for our products or product candidates  the pace and breadth of our drug discovery and development programs  expenditures we incur to identify  acquire  license  develop or promote additional products  expenditures we incur and assume in business acquisitions  availability of product supply from third party manufacturers  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  the timing of licensing and royalty revenues  third party payer and government reimbursement for our products  and the cost of competing products  including the cost of generic products that compete with our proprietary products 
for the year ended december   we reported net loss of million  including an estimated million of acquired in process research and development expense related to the guilford acquisition 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million inclusive of million of acquired in process research and development expense related to acquisitions  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  variations in the timing of our future revenues and expenses could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earnings shortfalls or losses 
because of these fluctuations  it is possible that our operating results for a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  causing the market price of our common stock to decrease 
for example  the trading price of our common stock during the period of january  to december  ranged from to 
our effective tax rate  if any  may vary significantly from period to period  especially within the first few years of becoming profitable 
increases in our effective tax rate would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
we have had no or minimal provision for income tax expense for a number of years due to a history of incurring significant losses 
our ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon our continued successful commercialization of aloxi  and therefore we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if and when it is judged to be more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance will be reduced and a tax benefit will be recorded 
these deferred tax assets include the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards acquired in the guilford  aesgen and zycos transactions all of which are subject to ownership change limitations and may also be subject to various other limitations on the amounts utilized 
for subsequent periods  our financial statement tax provision will likely approximate normal statutory tax rates 
a transition to an effective tax rate that approximates statutory tax rates could result in an increase in effective tax rate from less than percent to approximately percent 
an increase of this magnitude would result in a significant reduction in our net income and net income per share beginning with the quarter we are required to expense approximate statutory tax rates 
even if we begin reporting an effective tax rate that approximates statutory tax rates  various factors may continue to have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in overall levels of income before taxes  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  future levels of capital expenditures  and changes in the mix of activity in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
an increase in our effective tax rate would reduce our net income and net income per share 
clinical trials are complex and unpredictable and may be difficult to complete or produce unexpected results that could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product under development  including aloxi ponv  aloxi capsules  dacogen  saforis  aquavan  amolimogene hpv e e plasmid  irofulven and zyc  we  or our strategic collaborators  must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for use in each target indication 
we depend on collaboration with helsinn healthcare sa for aloxi  and for our other products other collaborators  medical institutions  and laboratories to conduct our clinical and preclinical testing in compliance with good clinical and laboratory practices as required by the fda 
we  or our strategic collaborators  may depend on contract research organizations to manage a substantial portion of the medical institutions utilized to conduct clinical testing 
the results from preclinical animal studies and human clinical trials are often not predictive of the results that will be obtained in large scale testing 
some of the results reported from clinical trials are interim results and may not be predictive of future results  including final results from such trials  because  among other factors  patient enrollment and the time period for evaluating patient results are not complete 
if we  or our strategic collaborators  fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate  the fda would not provide regulatory approval of the product 
the appearance of unacceptable toxicities  side effects or other adverse results during clinical trials could interrupt  limit  delay or stop the development of a product candidate 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in previous animal and human studies 
the time required to complete clinical trials is dependent upon  among other factors  the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of clinical protocol requirements  the diversion of patients to other trials or marketed therapies  our ability to recruit and manage clinical centers and associated trials  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  and the patient eligibility criteria for the trial 
other factors  such as lack of efficacy  unacceptable toxicities  or other adverse events  may result in increased costs and delays or termination of clinical trials prior to completion 
in addition  delays in manufacturing of product for our clinical trials could impact our ability to complete our clinical trials as planned 
any failure to meet expectations related to our product candidates could adversely affect our stock price 
because our product candidates such as dacogen  aquavan  saforis  amolimogene hpv e e plasmid  zyc and irofulven may have alternative development paths and we have limited resources  our focus on a particular development path for these product candidates may result in our failure to capitalize on more profitable areas and may not result in viable products 
we have limited financial and product development resources 
this requires us to focus on product candidates in specific areas and forego opportunities with regard to other product candidates or development paths 
for example  one of our product candidates  irofulven  is in clinical and preclinical trials for a number of indications 
we expect that a portion of our product development efforts over the next several years will be devoted to further development of irofulven  including its application to the treatment of cancers or sub populations of certain types of cancers with limited therapeutic options such as refractory cancers  for which we believe irofulven could most quickly be developed and approved for marketing 
we are also investigating the efficacy of irofulven in combination with other cancer therapies 
while some of these trials have indicated some effectiveness in relation to the target medical conditions  additional clinical trials must be conducted before product registration may be requested 
similar examples of resource trade offs also exist for our other product candidates 
in addition  the uncertainty of the development path for a particular product candidate makes it difficult to ascertain the capital resources that will be required 
our ability to achieve strong revenue growth for gliadel  aquavan  dacogen  and saforis may depend to a large extent on the results of additional clinical trials 
we may conduct additional clinical trials with gliadel to provide physicians with added clinical data and or to expand gliadel s labeled indications 
there is no assurance that such clinical trials  if any  will be successful  or if successful  will convince the fda that an additional indication is warranted 
also  if one or more additional clinical trials are not successful  sales of the product in its current markets could be adversely affected and could significantly adversely affect our ability to increase sales of gliadel 
additionally  our ability to increase the size of the potential market for aquavan will depend upon our success in obtaining approval for the product in a variety of procedural sedation settings 
we will likely need to conduct additional clinical trials beyond those we already have announced to do so  and such trials may not be successful or may not  in the determination of the fda  warrant an indication for aquavan larger than the one we are currently attempting to obtain 
in such cases  sales of aquavan may not meet our expectations 
we have initiated enrollment in a patient acute myeloid leukemia aml trial to expand on dacogen s expected labeled indications 
there is no assurance that such clinical trials  if any  will be successful  or if successful  will convince the fda that an additional indication is warranted 
additionally  dacogen has other clinical trials that seek to optimize the schedule in which the product is delivered to patients  which may or may not be enough data to assure an additional label change to the dosing section 
our ability to achieve strong revenue growth for saforis may depend to a large extent on the results of additional clinical trials that will adequately characterize the efficacy of saforis in patients receiving different types of cancer therapies 
additional trials may be undertaken with saforis to expand the market size in oral mucositis 
the outcome of these potential additional trials may or not warrant expansion of the label in the view of the fda 
in such a case where the fda views that these additional trials do not warrant an expanded label  saforis may under perform in meeting our expectations 
european regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions on our ability to import gliadel to the european union 
we have been informed by the european regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the testing and release of gliadel in the european union that we must test each sublot of gliadel that we ship to the european union 
each time a lot is tested it results in the destruction of a portion of the lot and the testing is costly 
this requirement may make it commercially unfeasible to ship small sublots of gliadel labeled for smaller european markets 
if we are not able to agree with the regulatory agency to an alternative method of testing and releasing sublots of gliadel  we may not be able to continue to ship gliadel to our distributors for smaller european markets 
as a result  growth in our gliadel revenue would be negatively affected 
we depend on a single supplier to provide us with the finished drug product for aloxi and dacogen and single suppliers to provide us with the active ingredients for other product candidates 
if the suppliers terminate their relationships with us  or are unable to fill our demand for the ingredients or products  we may be unable to sell aloxi  and the development of our product candidates could be delayed or if a product candidate is approved  the commercial launch could be delayed 
we rely on helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
as our sole and exclusive supplier of aloxi finished drug product 
helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
may make regulatory provision for alternate sites for the manufacture of aloxi 
however  if our relationship with helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
terminates  we will be unable to continue to offer aloxi for commercial sale 
we rely on pharmachemie bv as our sole supplier of the dacogen finished drug product 
in addition  we rely on other sole or exclusive suppliers for other product candidates finished drug products 
if our relationship with pharmachemie bv or another sole or exclusive supplier terminates or if the supplier is unable to meet our needs for any reason  we will need to find an alternative source of the products supplied by those companies 
if we are unable to identify an alternative source  we may have to suspend development of our product candidates or delay commercial launch of an approved product candidate 
even if we were able to procure drug product from an alternative source  any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our development goals or our ability to provide the commercial supply of an approved product candidate  which would cause our future product revenues to decrease and our stock price to decline 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
bankruptcy or financial distress of any of our customers would adversely affect our financial condition and fluctuations in their purchases of our products would cause volatility in our results of operations 
our principal customers  specialty pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers  comprise a significant part of the distribution network for oncology injectables and pharmaceutical products in the united states 
if any of these customers become insolvent or dispute payment of the amount it owes us  this would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
further  fluctuations in customer buying patterns and their amount of inventory of our products could cause volatility in our results of operations and materially  adversely impact our results of operations 
the timing of customer purchases and the resulting product shipments have a significant impact on the amount of revenue from product sales that the company recognizes in a particular period 
the majority of our sales are made to independent pharmaceutical wholesalers  including specialty oncology distributors  which  in turn  resell the product to an end user normally a clinic  hospital  alternative healthcare facility or an independent pharmacy 
inventory in the distribution channel consists of inventory held by independent pharmaceutical wholesalers  who are our principal customers 
our revenue from product sales in a particular period is impacted by increases or decreases in the distribution channel inventory levels 
if distribution channel inventory levels increase materially  we could experience reduced sales revenue in subsequent periods due to low patient demand 
we cannot significantly control or influence the purchasing patterns of independent pharmaceutical wholesalers or end users 
these are highly sophisticated customers that purchase our products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and  presumably based upon their projected demand levels 
from time to time  we offer sales incentives in the ordinary course of business 
these incentives may impact the level of inventory held by wholesalers 
additionally  the buying practices of the wholesalers include occasional speculative purchases of product in excess of the current market demand  at their discretion  in anticipation of future price increases 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below actual patient demand of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations in product inventory in the distribution channel 
if distribution channel inventory levels substantially exceed end user demand  we could experience reduced revenue from sales in subsequent periods due to a reduction in end user demand 
if the third party manufacturer of aloxi  salagen  or aggrastat or any of our other products ceases operations or fails to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations  we may not be able to meet customer demand in a timely manner  if at all 
we rely on helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
for the production of aloxi  patheon inc for the production of salagen  baxter pharmaceuticals for the production of aggrastat  and other third party manufacturers for our other products  other than gliadel  which we manufacture ourselves 
we expect to continue to rely on others to manufacture future products  including products currently in development 
our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver such products 
the manufacture of our products is  and will be  subject to current good manufacturing practices regulations enforced by the fda or other standards prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agency in the country of use 
there is a risk that the manufacturers of our products  including the current manufacturers of aloxi  salagen  and aggrastat  will not comply with all applicable regulatory standards  and may not be able to manufacture aloxi  salagen  aggrastat  or any other product for commercial sale 
if this occurs  we might not be able to identify another third party manufacturer on terms acceptable to us  or any other terms 
material changes to an approved product  such as manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims  require further fda review and approval 
even after approval is obtained  the fda may withdraw approval if previously unknown problems are discovered 
further  if we  our corporate collaborators or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory or manufacturing process  the fda may impose sanctions  including marketing or manufacturing delays  warning letters  fines  product recalls or seizures  injunctions  refusal of the fda to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications  total or partial suspension of production  civil penalties  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  or criminal prosecutions 
our business strategy depends on our ability to discover  acquire  license and develop product candidates and discover  acquire or license approved products 
if we are not able to undertake these activities successfully  we will not be able to achieve our corporate goals 
as part of our business strategy we plan to discover  acquire  license and develop product candidates and discover  acquire and license approved products for markets that we can reach through our marketing and distribution channels 
if we are unsuccessful in our drug discovery and acquisition strategy  our stock price could decline 
if we fail to discover  obtain  develop and successfully commercialize additional products  we may not meet expectations for our future performance and our stock price could decline 
other companies  including some with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  are competing with us to acquire or license products or product candidates 
we may not be able to acquire or license rights to additional products or product candidates on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully develop any product candidates we acquire or license 
in addition  we may acquire or license new products with different marketing strategies  distribution channels and bases of competition than those of our current products 
therefore  we may not be able to compete favorably in those product categories 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our recent and future acquisitions 
any acquisition strategy is subject to inherent risk and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete any acquisition  including the ability to identify potential partners  successfully negotiate economically beneficial terms  successfully integrate such business  retain its key employees and achieve the anticipated revenue  cost benefits or synergies 
we review the records of companies we plan to acquire  however  even an in depth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies 
as a result  we may assume unanticipated liabilities  or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected 
we also face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses  or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses 
on october   we closed the acquisition of guilford pharmaceuticals inc during the third quarter of  we acquired zycos  inc 
and aesgen  inc we may acquire other companies in the future as a part of our business strategy 
the integration of independent companies is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others retaining key employees and collaborators  coordinating research and development activities  consolidating corporate and administrative functions  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully integrate the companies we acquire  the integrations may not result in the realization of the full benefits of development and growth opportunities that we currently expect or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
in an acquisition  some customers may seek alternative sources of product after the announcement of the merger or after the merger due to  among other reasons  a desire not to do business with the combined company or perceived concerns that the combined company may not continue to support and develop certain products 
after an acquisition  a combined company could also experience some customer attrition or disputes by reason of the acquisition 
our failure to achieve expected benefits from an acquisition or to minimize the impact of any negative effect could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may need to obtain additional capital to grow our business and complete our product portfolio development and expansion plans 
issuance of new securities may dilute the interests of our stockholders and constrain our operating flexibility 
we may need to raise additional funds for various reasons including the following to expand our portfolio of marketed products  product candidates  and research programs  to develop products we have discovered  acquired  or licensed  to commercialize our product candidates  including research and clinical trial expenses  to obtain necessary working capital  and to fund operating losses 
adequate funds for these purposes may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds may cause us to delay  scale back  or abandon some or all of our product acquisition and licensing programs and product development programs 
we may seek additional funding through public and private financing  including equity and debt financing or enter into collaborative arrangements 
any sale of additional convertible debt securities or equity securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders and any debt financing may require us to pledge our assets and enter into restrictive covenants 
entry into collaborative arrangements may require us to give up rights to some of our products or to some potential markets or to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with strategic collaborators or enter into new relationships  we may not be able to develop any of our product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner  if at all 
our continued success will depend in large part upon the efforts of third parties 
for the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of our products  we currently have  and will likely continue to enter into  various arrangements with other corporations  licensors  licensees  outside researchers  consultants and others 
however  we cannot be certain of the actions these parties will take  and there is a risk that we will be unable to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements to develop or commercialize our products  any arrangements with third parties will not be successful  strategic collaborators will not fulfill their obligations to us under any arrangements entered into with them  strategic collaborators  including helsinn healthcare sa  will terminate their relationship with us  or current or potential collaborators will pursue treatments for other diseases or seek alternative means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our programs or products 
our strategic collaborators include public research institutions  research organizations  teaching and research hospitals  community based clinics  testing laboratories  contract product formulation organizations  contract packaging and distribution companies  manufacturers  suppliers and license collaborators 
we consider our arrangements with helsinn healthcare sa  patheon inc  merck kgaa  and supergen  inc 
to be significant 
if any of our collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or otherwise fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  we may experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of the products or product candidates or the research program covered by the agreement and we may need to devote additional funds or other resources to these activities 
if we are unable to enter into new or alternative arrangements to continue research and development activities  or are unable to continue these activities on our own  we may have to terminate the development program 
as a consequence  we may experience a loss of future commercial product potential and a decline in our stock price 
we have licensed the right to promote  sell and distribute aloxi products in the united states and canada from helsinn healthcare sa 
we are particularly dependent on helsinn for our ability to commercialize aloxi products 
we have entered a license agreement with helsinn healthcare sa under which we have acquired a license to sell and distribute aloxi products in the united states and canada through december  furthermore  under the terms of our license  we are required to purchase all of our aloxi products from helsinn birex pharmaceutical  ltd 
the license agreement may be terminated for specified reasons  including if the other party is in substantial or persistent breach of the agreement  if we have experienced a change of control and the acquiring entity has competing products or our marketing and sales related commitments to the licensor are not maintained by the acquiring entity  or if either party has declared bankruptcy 
although we are not currently in breach of the license  and we believe that helsinn healthcare sa is not currently in breach of the license  there is a risk that either party could breach the license in the future 
in addition  if we were to breach the supply agreement with helsinn birex pharmaceutical ltd 
contemplated by the license  helsinn healthcare sa would be permitted to terminate the license 
if the license agreement were terminated  we would lose all of our rights to sell and distribute aloxi products  as well as all of the related intellectual property and all regulatory approvals 
in addition  helsinn healthcare sa holds the rights to palonosetron the active ingredient in aloxi products through an agreement with syntex usa inc and f 
hoffmann la roche ag 
we cannot be certain of the actions that these parties will take  and there is a risk that these third parties will end their relationship with us  which would leave us without rights to the pharmaceutical preparations  products and know how required to produce aloxi products 
as a consequence of such a termination  we would lose all of our rights to sell and distribute aloxi products  which would harm our business and could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
we rely on multinational and foreign pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates in markets outside the united states 
with respect to products in which we own rights outside the united states  we have entered into alliances with various multinational and foreign pharmaceutical companies related to the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates in markets outside the united states 
our continued relationships with strategic collaborators are dependent in part on the successful achievement of development milestones 
if we or our collaborators do not achieve these milestones  or we are unable to enter into agreements with our collaborators to modify their terms  these agreements could terminate  which could cause a loss of licensing revenue  a loss of future commercial product potential and a decline in our stock price 
we recognize licensing revenue from our strategic collaborators as a portion of our total revenue 
future licensing revenues from these collaborators will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the achievement of milestones by us or our collaborators  the amount of product sales and royalty generating activities  the timing of initiating additional licensing relationships  and our continuing obligation related to license payments 
if we fail to compete successfully with our competitors  our product revenues could decrease and our stock price could decline 
competition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense 
most of our competitors are large  multinational pharmaceutical companies that have considerably greater financial  sales  marketing and technical resources than we do 
most of our present and potential competitors also have dedicated research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that compete with our products 
currently  aloxi competes with three other products from the ht receptor antagonist class of compounds  as well as products from other chemical classes that are also used for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
these products are marketed by glaxosmithkline  roche  sanofi aventis  merck and other large multinational competitors 
if aloxi does not compete successfully with existing products on the market  our stock price could decline significantly 
gliadel currently competes as a treatment of malignant glioma with traditional systemic chemotherapy  radioactive seeds  radiation catheters  temodar capsules  a chemotherapy product manufactured by schering corporation  and other experimental protocols 
additionally  medimmune  inc  daichi pharmaceutical  and three us generic manufacturers have drugs that are approved for sale and compete in the same markets as salagen 
other pharmaceutical companies are developing products  which  if approved by the fda  will compete directly with our products 
our competitors could also develop and introduce generic drugs comparable to our products  or drugs or combination of drugs or other therapies that address the underlying causes of the symptoms that our products treat 
if a product developed by a competitor is more effective than our product  or priced lower than our product  our product revenue could decrease and our stock price could decline 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
if we are not able to attract and retain key employees and consultants  our product development  marketing and commercialization plans could be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the members of our scientific  commercial and management staff 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons  our product development  marketing and commercialization plans may suffer and our stock price could decline 
none of our executive officers has an employment agreement with us 
if we are unable to retain our scientific  commercial and management staff  we will need to hire additional qualified personnel for us to pursue our product acquisition  development  marketing and commercialization plans 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms  given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel  our product acquisition  development  marketing and commercialization plans will suffer and our stock price could decline 
if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological changes in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  we may be unable to continue our operations 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have experienced rapid and significant technological change 
we expect that pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology will continue to develop rapidly 
our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop and maintain technology that is competitive 
if other companies achieve technological advances with their products or obtain fda approval before we are able to obtain such approval  our products may become obsolete before they are marketed or before we recover any of our development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
in addition  alternative therapies or new medical treatments could alter existing treatment regimens  and thereby reduce the need for one or more of our products  which could result in the termination of the development in one or more of our product candidates  or in the decline in sales of one of our approved products  which could cause our stock price to decline 
if we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates  or if regulatory approval is delayed for any reason  we will be unable to commercialize and sell our products as we expect 
prior to marketing  each of our product candidates must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process conducted by the fda in the united states and by comparable agencies in other countries 
the product development and approval process can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
there is risk that the fda or a foreign regulatory authority will not approve in a timely manner  if at all  any product we develop 
generally  the fda approves for sale only a very small percentage of newly discovered pharmaceutical compounds that enter preclinical development 
we may encounter delays or denials in regulatory approvals due to changes in fda policy during the period of development  or changes in the requirements for regulatory review of each submitted new drug application nda 
there is also risk that regulatory authorities in the united states and elsewhere may not allow us to conduct planned additional clinical testing of any of our product candidates  including irofulven  dacogen  saforis  amolimogene hpv e e plasmid  zyc  aquavan or aloxi products  or that  if permitted  this additional clinical testing will not prove that these product candidates are safe and effective to the extent necessary to permit us to obtain marketing approvals from regulatory authorities 
once we receive regulatory approval to market a product  our promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation from the fda  the federal trade commission ftc  the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services oig  or state attorney general 
if we violate any such regulations it could be damaging to our reputation and restrict our ability to sell or market our products  and our business condition could be adversely affected 
in their regulation of advertising  the fda from time to time issues correspondence alleging that some advertising or promotional practices are false  misleading or deceptive 
the fda has the power to impose a wide array of sanctions on companies for such advertising or promotional practices  and the receipt of correspondence from the fda alleging these practices could result in any or all of the following incurring substantial expenses  including fines  penalties  legal fees and costs to comply with the fda s requirements  changes in the methods of marketing and selling products  taking fda mandated corrective action  which may include placing advertisements or sending letters to physicians  rescinding previous advertisements or promotions  and disruption in the distribution of products and loss of revenue until compliance with the fda s position is obtained 
if we were to become subject to any of the above requirements  it could be damaging to our reputation  and our business condition could be adversely affected 
physicians may prescribe pharmaceutical products for uses that are not described in a product s labeling or differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda 
while such off label uses are common and the fda does not regulate physicians choice of treatments  the fda does restrict a manufacturer s communications on the subject of off label use 
companies cannot actively promote fda approved pharmaceutical products for off label uses  but under certain limited circumstances they may disseminate articles to physicians published in peer reviewed journals 
if our promotional activities of this type fail to comply with the fda s regulations or guidelines  we may be subject to warnings from  or enforcement action by  the fda 
additionally  if we fail to comply with the fda regulations prohibiting promotion of off label uses and the promotion of our products  the fda  ftc  department of justice  oig or state attorney general could bring enforcement actions against us that would inhibit our marketing capabilities as well as result in significant penalties 
if we are unable to obtain intellectual property protection  or protect our proprietary technology  we may be unable to compete effectively 
we hold an exclusive license in the united states and canada on patents covering aloxi 
in addition  we hold an exclusive  worldwide license on patents and patent applications covering acylfulvene proprietary rights  including irofulven 
the license applicable to these technologies is subject to certain statutory rights held by the us government 
even though we have licensed these patents  we may not have exclusive rights to all possible acylfulvene analogs  all possible methods of using acylfulvene analogs to treat tumors or all possible synthetic methods for preparing acylfulvenes 
in addition  we licensed rights to patents and patent applications covering mg protection of these rights and creation of additional rights involve joint responsibilities between us and the respective license party 
we have recently acquired rights to patents and patent applications covering technologies that were owned by or licensed to zycos  inc  and aesgen  inc  and those rights that were licensed from third parties were assigned to us in those transactions 
we have also recently obtained a worldwide  exclusive license of certain rights to patents and patent applications covering technologies that are owned by supergen  inc  or licensed to supergen  inc  from third parties 
in our acquisition of guilford  we obtained an exclusive license to intellectual property  including patents  patent applications and know how  related to gliadel  which requires us to pay a royalty to the massachusetts institute of technology on revenue from gliadel 
our us patent protection for gliadel expires in august in addition  in february  the fda awarded orphan drug status for gliadel for seven years for the treatment of patients with malignant glioma undergoing primary surgical resection 
accordingly  following the expiration of us patent protection  we now have approximately four additional years of market exclusivity for gliadel for initial surgical resection 
however  there can be no assurance that others will not enter the market with a generic copy of gliadel for recurrent surgical resection 
the availability of such a generic copy could negatively impact our revenues from gliadel for initial surgical resection after august our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future  or those we license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  other entities may develop similar technologies that fall outside the scope of our patents 
thus  any patent rights that we own or license from third parties may not provide sufficient protection against potential competitors 
in the event that our technologies or methods used in the course of developing or selling our products infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of third parties  we and our strategic collaborators may be prevented from pursuing product development or commercialization 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants 
there is a risk that these confidentiality agreements will be breached  we will not have adequate remedies for any breach of these agreements  our trade secrets will otherwise become known  or our trade secrets will be independently discovered and used by competitors 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been characterized by litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be diverted 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using the technology or to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms  if at all  or to cease manufacturing and selling our products 
this could cause us to terminate the development of one or more of our product candidates  to discontinue marketing an existing product  or to pay royalties to a third party 
any of these events could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
if the use of one of our products is alleged to be harmful  we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products is alleged to have harmed someone 
although we have taken  and continue to take  what we believe are appropriate precautions  there is a risk that we will not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and in the aggregate for the year for products  product candidates and clinical trials 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to cover claims 
there is also a risk that adequate insurance coverage will not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the successful assertion of an uninsured product liability or other claim against us could cause us to incur a significant expense to pay such a claim  could adversely affect our product development and could cause a decline in our product revenue and the price of our stock 
in addition to product liability risks associated with sales of our products  we may be liable to the claims of individuals who participate in clinical trials of our products 
a number of patients who participate in trials are already critically ill when they enter a trial 
the waivers we obtain may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation 
our product liability insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 
as a result of these factors  a product liability claim  even if successfully defended  could cause us to incur a significant expense to defend such a claim  could adversely affect our product development and could cause a decline in our product revenue and the price of our stock 
we could become the subject of legal proceedings or investigations that could result in substantial fines  penalties  injunctive or administrative penalties and criminal charges  which would increase our expenses and redirect management s attention away from business operations 
our business operations are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations 
other pharmaceutical companies have been the subjects of legal proceedings or investigations related to pricing  marketing  promotional and clinical trial practices 
if we become the subject of legal proceedings or investigations  our expenses would increase and commercialization of our products could be adversely affected 
further  management s attention would be diverted from our business operations 
if we issue a product recall  we may not sell as much of our products in the future and we may incur significant expenses 
the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority over product sales may request product recalls or we may independently issue product recalls 
these product recalls may occur due to manufacturing issues  safety concerns or other reasons 
we do not carry any insurance to cover the risk of a product recall 
any product recall could have a material adverse effect on our product revenue and could cause the price of our stock to decline 
if we or patients using our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  our product sales  net income  cash balances and price of our stock could decline 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which private health insurers  organizations such as hmos and governmental authorities reimburse the cost of our products and related treatments 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
there is uncertainty about the reimbursement status of healthcare products 
our profitability will depend in part on the price we are able to charge for our products  and the availability of adequate reimbursement for our products to providers from third party payors  such as government entities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
federal and state regulations govern or influence the reimbursement status of healthcare products in many situations and third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of together with rulemaking by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms require a number of changes in medicare practices  including reimbursement 
the changes made to date are not expected to have an adverse affect on our operations  sales or the price of our stock  but we cannot predict the impact  if any  of future provider reimbursement changes 
aloxi  salagen  and gliadel generally have been eligible for reimbursement to providers from third party payors and we have applied for  or in certain cases already received confirmation of  reimbursement eligibility for providers for aloxi 
third party reimbursement is important to the commercialization of our products 
if government entities and other third party payors do not provide adequate reimbursement levels to providers for our products  our product and license revenues would be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
in recent years  various parties have proposed a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing national healthcare systems 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control of pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals 
cost controls  if mandated by a government agency  could decrease the price that we receive for our current or future products 
these proposals  if enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our product and license revenues and could cause our stock price to decline 
in certain countries  regulatory authorities must also approve the sales price of a product after they grant marketing approval 
there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain satisfactory prices in foreign markets even if we obtain marketing approval from foreign regulatory authorities 
our operations  and the operations of our third party contractors  involve hazardous materials that could expose us to liability if environmental damage occurs 
our research  development and manufacturing operations and the operations of our third party contractors involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if we do not comply with environmental regulations  we may face significant fines or penalties 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  third parties or governmental entities may hold us liable for any resulting damages  which  along with fines and penalties  may exceed our financial resources and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations 
our stock price is volatile  which may result in significant losses to stockholders and holders of our convertible notes 
the market price for our convertible notes is significantly impacted by the price of our common stock  which has historically been volatile 
there has been significant volatility in the market prices of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies securities 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  and some of these factors are beyond our control 
these factors include fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or acquisitions or licensing of therapeutic products or product candidates by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  positive or negative progress with our clinical trials  governmental regulation  including healthcare reimbursement policies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  developments in our relationship with collaborators and suppliers  and announcements of new strategic collaborations  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of our products  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these factors  including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock into the market 
our stock price ranged from to per share during the three year period ended december  broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following large falls in the price of a company s shares  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
any adverse determination in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities 
we have outstanding options  convertible notes and warrants that have the potential to dilute stockholder value and cause our stock value to decline 
we routinely grant stock options to our employees and other individuals 
at december   we had options outstanding at option prices ranging from to for million shares of our common stock that have been registered for resale 
additionally  in our acquisition of guilford  we assumed warrants to purchase  of our shares at a weighted average exercise price net of cash we would be required to pay on exercise of 
we have also issued convertible debt that is convertible into million shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share of common stock 
conversion of our convertible debt is contingent on a number of factors that have not yet been satisfied 
consequently  we are not able to estimate when  if ever  our convertible debt will be converted into common stock  but any such conversion would almost certainly dilute stockholder value 
the guilford merger resulted in an obligation for us to make an offer to repurchase all the guilford convertible subordinatd notes guilford notes due july  in accordance with the terms of the related indenture at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  up to but excluding the payment date 
each  principal amount of the guilford notes was convertible  at the option of the holder  into i shares of mgi pharma common stock  and ii in cash through november  at the expiration of the offer to repurchase  million of the guilford notes were outstanding 
if some or all of such shares are sold into the public market over a short time period  the value of our stock is likely to decline  as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at the prevailing market prices 
such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future on terms that we deem acceptable 
our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and minnesota law contain provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
our charter documents contain provisions that may discourage third parties from seeking to acquire our company 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  and the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan  or poison pill  which enables our board of directors to issue preferred stock purchase rights that would be triggered by an acquisition of percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
these provisions and specific provisions of minnesota law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a merger or change in control 
some of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of our company even if stockholders would receive an attractive value for their shares or if a significant number of our stockholders believed such a proposed transaction to be in their best interests 
as a result  stockholders who desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so
