item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the following text contains references to years   and  which refer to our fiscal years ending or ended december   december   january  and january   respectively  unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december consequently  we periodically have a week fiscal year 
our year was a week fiscal year 
overview we earn revenues primarily from the sale of food and non food products to the foodservice  or food away from home  industry 
our expenses consist mainly of cost of goods sold  which includes the amounts paid to manufacturers for products  and operating expenses  which include primarily labor related expenses  delivery costs and occupancy expenses related to our facilities 
for discussion of our business and strategies  see the business section of this form k 
according to industry research  the restaurant industry captures nearly half of the total share of the consumer s food dollar 
an industry research firm is projecting foodservice distributor sales to continue to grow in we believe the trends that are fueling the demand for food away from home include the aging of the baby boomer population  rising incomes  more two income households and consumer demand for convenience 
according to industry research  older adults on average spend significantly more on food away from home than younger adults do 
in addition  younger and higher income consumers are increasingly starved for time and looking for ways to save time by shifting meal preparation to others by dining out or buying prepared or convenience foods 
consumers are seeking healthier menu choices 
several national casual dining restaurants  including certain of our customers  have introduced low carb menu items in an effort to meet the demands of consumers seeking to reduce their carbohydrate intake 
in addition  in an effort to reduce meal preparation time  consumers are seeking prepared or partially prepared food items from retail establishments 
the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and consolidating 
in the last decade  the ten largest broadline foodservice distributors have significantly increased their collective market share through both acquiring smaller foodservice distributors and internal growth 
over the past decade  we have supplemented our internal growth through selective  strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us 
our net sales in increased over  with all of our sales growth coming from existing operations 
we estimate that food price inflation contributed approximately to our growth in net sales in gross profit margin  which we define as gross profit as a percentage of net sales  declined slightly in compared to  primarily due to the shift in customer mix in our broadline segment towards more multi unit business  which carries a lower gross margin 
our operating expense ratio  which we define as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  declined slightly in compared to the increase in multi unit business  which carries a lower expense ratio  and operational efficiencies in our broadline segment were the main drivers in our decreased operating expense ratio 
higher fuel and insurance costs in both the broadline and customized segments  as well as higher occupancy costs in our customized segment  partially offset some of the improvements in the operating expense ratio for the year 

table of contents going forward  we continue to be very focused on executing our strategies  driving standardization of best practices and achieving operational excellence initiatives in each of our business segments 
we continue to seek innovative means of servicing our customers to distinguish ourselves from others in the marketplace

we refer to independent restaurants serviced by our sales representatives as street customers 
street customers tend to use more of our proprietary brands and value added services  resulting in higher margin sales 
we continued to focus on sales of our proprietary brands  which typically generate higher margins than national brands 
sales of our proprietary brands represented of street sales in  compared to in and in in  we also continued to increase our sales of center of the plate items  including beef  poultry  seafood and other proteins 
we believe that selling more center of the plate items positions us favorably with our customers

the negative impact on broadline s net sales as a result of these hurricanes was approximately to million 
the hurricanes also delayed the rollout of certain new multi unit business until the fourth quarter 
also during the fourth quarter  we began exiting approximately million of annualized multi unit sales  the majority of which is a result of our own initiative to rationalize business that does not meet our profit objectives

income tax expense income tax expense from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  the provision for income taxes was  and in  and  respectively 
the decline in our effective tax rate in from was primarily due to state tax effects associated with the sale of our fresh cut segment  the benefit of tax exempt interest received on the proceeds from the sale of our fresh cut segment and adjustments to taxes payable due to the closing of federal and state statute of limitations

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  operating leases  normal trade credit terms and the sale of our common stock 
despite our growth in net sales  we have reduced our working capital needs by financing our investment in inventory principally with accounts payable and outstanding checks in excess of deposits 
we typically fund our acquisitions  and expect to fund future acquisitions  with our existing cash  additional borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   an increase of million from january  the increase of cash was due to cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of million and cash provided by discontinued operations of million  including net cash proceeds from the sale of our fresh cut segment  partially offset by cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of million and cash used in financing activities of continuing operations of million

table of contents operating activities of continuing operations during  we generated cash from operating activities of million  compared to million in and million in cash provided by operating activities for all three years was primarily due to increased sales in all of our business segments  partially offset by increased cost of goods sold and operating expenses  discussed above in results of operations 
the increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to higher average daily sales in december compared to december and december in october and july  we received an additional million and million  respectively  of proceeds from the sales of incremental undivided interests in receivables under our receivables facility 
these proceeds are reflected in the change in accounts receivable on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see off balance sheet activities below for further discussion of our receivables facility 
despite the sale of the incremental undivided interest in receivables under our receivables facility in  accounts receivable increased by million in inventories increased by million in  compared to an increase of million in inventories increased in due to increased sales volume and incremental inventory for new and existing multi unit customers 
inventories increased in mainly due to increased sales volume and the rollout of new menu items for certain customized segment customers near the end of trade accounts payable increased by million in  compared to an increase of million in the increases in and were due mainly to higher inventory levels and the timing of payments made

table of contents transaction costs  to repurchase million shares of our outstanding common stock 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details of our share repurchase and retirement 
at december   total debt recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was million 
on october   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement that provides us with up to million in borrowing capacity  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  under our credit facility that expires on october  we have the right  without the consent of the lenders  to increase the total amount of the facility to million 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at the base rate  defined as the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the overnight federal funds rate plus  or libor plus a spread of to 
the credit agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of unused commitments 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  as described in the credit agreement  and contains customary events of default 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding  million of letters of credit outstanding and million available under the credit facility  subject to compliance with customary borrowing conditions 
in  we reduced our total debt by million through a combination of debt repayments of  partially offset by million in additional borrowings under our credit facility

checks in excess of deposits decreased by million in and increased by million in checks in excess of deposits represent checks that we have written that are not yet cashed by the payee and in total exceed the current available cash balance at the respective bank 
the decrease in checks in excess of deposits is due to higher inventory levels and timing of payments due to our efforts to improve cash management 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and the sale of undivided interests in receivables under our receivables facility  discussed below  will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we will likely require additional sources of financing to the extent that we make acquisitions in the future 
the table below presents contractual minimum cash obligations under long term debt  capital leases  operating leases and purchase obligations as of december  long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets includes both debt and capital leases 
lease payments include payments due under our existing non cancelable operating leases 
in the table below  purchase obligations refers to specific agreements to purchase goods  which are enforceable and legally binding 
purchase obligations do not include outstanding purchase orders for inventory in the normal course of business  other than those discussed below  and do not include non cancelable service contracts 
the table does not include liabilities for deferred income taxes or the receivables facility 
this table should be read in conjunction with notes  and to our consolidated financial statements

table of contents contracts to purchase products totaling million  which expire throughout these purchase commitments are included in purchase obligations in the above table 
amounts due under these contracts were not included on our consolidated balance sheet at december   in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
we expect to use future cash flows from operations and residual cash proceeds from the sale of our fresh cut segment to fund these obligations 
we have entered into numerous operating leases  including leases of buildings  equipment  tractors and trailers 
in certain of these leases  we have provided residual value guarantees to the lessors 
circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees include either our default on the leases with the leased assets being sold for less than the specified residual values in the lease agreements  or our decision not to purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms combined with the sale of the assets  with sales proceeds less than the residual value of the leased assets specified in the lease agreements 
our residual value guarantees under these operating lease agreements typically range between and of the value of the leased assets at inception of the lease 
these leases have original terms ranging from two to nine years and expiration dates ranging from to at december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees totaled million  which would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease expiration 
our assessment as to whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantees is based upon our actual and expected loss experience 
consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standard board interpretation no 
 we have recorded  of the million of potential future payments under these guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  additionally  we do not consider payments under these guarantees  if any  reasonably likely to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
notes and to our consolidated financial statements provide further discussion of these guarantees and the related accounting and disclosure requirements 
in connection with the sale of our fresh cut segment  we remained obligated on a guarantee of the future lease payments of one of the fresh cut segment facilities that was sold to chiquita 
we will be required to perform under the guarantee if chiquita defaults on its lease obligations 
in connection with the sale of the fresh cut segment to chiquita  chiquita assumed our obligation under the guarantee and agreed to indemnify us for any losses it suffers as a result of chiquita s failure to perform its assumed obligations 
we estimate our maximum exposure under the guarantee obligation is million 
in addition  chiquita has delivered a letter of credit in an initial amount of million to us as security for the performance of its assumed guarantee obligations 
consistent with the requirements of fin  we have recorded an estimated liability of million in our consolidated financial statements as of december  discontinued operations on june   we completed the sale of all our stock in the subsidiaries that comprised our fresh cut segment to chiquita brands international  inc for million and recorded a net gain of approximately million  net of approximately million in net tax expense  subject to final working capital adjustments 
the tax expense is comprised of approximately million in current tax expense  partially offset by approximately million in deferred tax benefit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 depreciation and amortization were discontinued beginning february   the day after we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our fresh cut segment 
this resulted in a reduction of pre tax expense of approximately million  or per share diluted for earnings from discontinued operations  excluding gain on sale  net  for was million  net of tax expense of million 
in accordance with eitf no 
 allocation of interest to discontinued operations  we allocated to discontinued operations certain interest expense on debt that was required to be repaid as a result of the sale and a portion of interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility and subordinated convertible notes 
the allocation percentage was calculated based on the ratio of net assets of the discontinued operations to consolidated net assets 
interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet activities we have a receivables facility  which is generally described as off balance sheet financing 
in financing activities above  we describe certain purchase obligations  earnout agreements with certain of the former owners of the businesses that we have acquired  and residual value guarantees  all of which could be considered off balance sheet items 
refer to the discussion in financing activities above and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commitments  contingencies and leases 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing because the transaction and the financial institution s ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable results in assets being removed from our consolidated balance sheet to the extent that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires us to account for the transaction with the financial institution as a sale of the undivided interest in the accounts 
table of contents receivable instead of reflecting the financial institution s net investment of million as debt 
we believe that the receivables facility provides us with additional liquidity at a very competitive cost compared to other forms of financing 
in july  we entered into the receivables facility  under which pfg receivables corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  sold an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables 
pfg receivables corporation was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables generated by certain of our operating units and selling an undivided interest in those receivables to a financial institution 
under the receivables facility  certain of our operating units sell a portion of their accounts receivable to pfg receivables corporation  which in turn  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables to the financial institution 
our operating units continue to service the receivables on behalf of the financial institution at estimated market rates 
accordingly  we have not recognized a servicing asset or liability 
we received million of proceeds from the sale of the undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility in in june  we increased the amount of the undivided interest in the receivables that can be owned by the financial institution to million 
in july  we sold an incremental undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility and received an additional million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility and to fund working capital needs 
on october   we sold another incremental undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility and received an additional million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
in june  the company extended the term of the receivables facility through june  if the receivables facility terminates  either at its scheduled termination date or upon the occurrence of specified events similar to events of default  payments on accounts receivable sold would be remitted to the financial institution in an amount equal to the institution s undivided interest 
at december   securitized accounts receivable totaled million  including million sold to the financial institution and derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet 
total securitized accounts receivable includes our residual interest in accounts receivable of million 
the residual interest represents our retained interest in receivables held by pfg receivables corporation 
we measure the residual interest using the estimated discounted cash flows of the underlying accounts receivable  based on estimated collections and a discount rate approximately equivalent to our incremental borrowing rate 
losses on the sale of the undivided interest in receivables of million in  million in  and million in are included in other expense  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings and represent our cost of securitizing those receivables with the financial institution 
we record the sale of the undivided interest in accounts receivable to the financial institution according to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  at the time the undivided interest in receivables is sold  the receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a loss on the sale of the undivided interest in these receivables  which includes a discount  based upon the receivables credit quality and a financing cost for the financial institution  based upon a day commercial paper rate 
at december   the rate under the receivables facility was per annum 
business combinations during we paid approximately million related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for companies we acquired in and also during  we paid approximately million related to the settlement of an earnout agreement with the former owners of middendorf meat  this amount was accrued in with a corresponding increase to goodwill 
in  we paid million and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  net  valued at approximately  related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for all kitchens  which we acquired in  carroll county foods  which we acquired in  and other companies acquired 
as discussed above  we also accrued approximately million in related to the settlement of an earnout agreement with the former owners of middendorf meat 
in  we paid million and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately  related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for all kitchens  tpc  carroll county foods and other companies acquired 
we acquired all kitchens and tpc in we recorded these earnout payments as additional purchase price  with corresponding increases in goodwill 
also during  we finalized the purchase price of middendorf meat  resulting in the return of million in cash and million in our common stock from the former owners of middendorf meat  related to the closing net worth adjustment and certain related claims 
we recorded this adjustment to the purchase price as a reduction of goodwill 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
in preparing our financial statements  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting periods 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we determine to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates include goodwill and other intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  our insurance program  reserve for inventories  vendor rebates and other promotional incentives and income taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers or other factors change  we may need to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables 
in  and  we wrote off uncollectible accounts receivable of million  million and million  respectively  against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in  and  we recorded estimates of million  million and million  respectively  in operating expenses to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts

we maintain reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
these reserves are primarily based upon inventory age plus specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions 
a sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and a corresponding charge to earnings 
we actively manage our inventory levels to minimize the risk of loss and have consistently achieved a high level of inventory turnover 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill and other intangible assets primarily include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  trade names  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements 
we use estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assigning lives to acquired intangibles and evaluating those assets for impairment after acquisition 
these estimates and assumptions include indicators that would trigger an impairment of assets  whether those indicators are temporary  economic or competitive factors that affect valuation  discount rates and cash flow estimates 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable  or the estimated lives assigned to such assets are improper  we must reduce the carrying value of the assets to the net realizable value or adjust the amortization period of the asset  recording any adjustment in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as of december   our unamortized goodwill was million and other intangible assets totaled million  net 
sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of  except for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to june   for which the standard was effective beginning july  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of the beginning of sfas no 
requires us to assess goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units and our intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if we determine that the fair values of our reporting units are less than the carrying amount of goodwill  we must recognize an impairment loss in our financial statements 
to perform the assessment of significant other non amortized intangible assets  we compare the book value of the asset to the discounted expected future operating cash flows generated by the specific asset 
if we determine the discounted future operating cash flows are less than the recorded values of other unamortized assets  we must recognize an impairment loss in our financial statements 
annually  we are also required to evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets that are not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for our broadline segment  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
our customized segment has no goodwill or other intangible assets 
in  and  no impairment loss was recorded based on these assessments 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units and intangible 
table of contents assets with indefinite lives based upon discounting future operating cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
a change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows or discount rate used in our calculation of the fair value of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we report intangible assets with definite lives at cost less accumulated amortization 
we compute amortization over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally three to years 
we test these intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in order to evaluate the recoverability of an asset  we compare the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if we determine that the estimated  undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet  we must record an impairment loss in our financial statements 
in  and  no impairment loss was recorded for intangible assets with definite lives 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions related to the valuation of the reporting units and intangible assets with definite lives  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 
therefore  as we become aware of additional information  we may change our estimates 
insurance programs 
we maintain self insurance programs covering portions of our general and vehicle liability  workers compensation and group medical insurance 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third parties  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
the company utilizes third party actuaries to assist in the calculation of these reserves 
we accrue an estimated liability for these self insured programs  including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  based on known claims and past claims history 
these accrued liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
our reserves for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claim occurrences  as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid 
the accounting estimate of the self insurance liability includes both known and incurred but not reported insurance claims 
this estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period if claims differ from past claims history  which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
if we experience claims in excess of our estimates by  our insurance expense and related insurance liability would increase by million  negatively affecting our consolidated financial statements 
vendor rebates and other promotional incentives 
we participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers  including volume and growth rebates  annual and multi year incentives and promotional programs 
in accounting for vendor rebates  we follow the guidance in eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor and eitf no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
we generally record consideration received under these incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
however  in certain circumstances  we record the consideration as a reduction of costs that we incur 
we may receive consideration in the form of cash and or invoice deductions 
we treat changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received as changes in estimates and recognize them in the period of change 
we record consideration that we receive for incentives containing volume and growth rebates and annual and multi year incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
we systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives 
if the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable  we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved 
we record annual and multi year incentives when we earn them  generally over the agreement period 
we estimate whether we will achieve the underlying objectives or milestones using current and historical purchasing data  forecasted purchasing volumes and other factors 
we record consideration received to promote and sell the supplier s products as a reduction of our costs  as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us 
if we receive consideration from the suppliers in excess of our costs  we record any excess as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we must make judgments in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transaction 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
at december  and january   we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards for state income tax purposes 
the net operating loss carryforwards at december  expire in years through additionally  at december   we had certain state income 
table of contents tax credit carryforwards  which expire in years through our realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we project future taxable income and consider prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  we would record valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding charge to net earnings 
based on our evaluation  we recorded an allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the above disclosure 
our financial statements contain other items that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include our calculations for bonus accruals  depreciation and amortization 
changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our consolidated financial statements

on february   the compensation committee of our board of directors voted to accelerate the vesting of certain unvested options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock held by certain employees and officers under its employee stock incentive plan and equity incentive plan which had exercise prices greater than the closing price of its common stock on february  these options became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration and  as a result  we will not be required to recognize any compensation expense associated with these option grants in future years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are related to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
our primary interest rate risk is from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
we currently manage this risk through a combination of fixed and floating rates on these obligations 
as of december   our total debt consisted of fixed rate debt of million 
as of january   our total debt consisted of fixed and floating rate debt of million and million  respectively 
in addition  our receivables facility has a floating rate 
substantially all of our floating rates are based on libor with the exception of the rate on the receivables facility  which is based upon a day 
table of contents commercial paper rate 
a basis point increase in market interest rates on all of our floating rate debt and our receivables facility would result in a decrease in net earnings and cash flows of approximately  per annum  holding other variables constant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and receivables facility  respectively 
significant commodity price fluctuations for certain commodities that we purchase could have a material impact on our results of operations
