each of our products is currently manufactured in only one location  since we believe that the technological know how and precision needed to make each of our products requires specialized expertise 
highlights of revenue increased to million from million in veeco experienced strong growth in the data storage and semiconductor markets  up and  respectively  from this growth was somewhat offset by a decline in sales to the hb led wireless industry and a decrease in sales to the scientific research marketplace  veeco s revenues by segment were million from ion beam and mechanical process equipment  million from epitaxial process equipment  and million from metrology  up  down and up  respectively  from  sales by region were north america  europe  japan and asia pacific  orders were million in  down from million in veeco improved its profitability in through a focus on gross margin improvements  cost reduction initiatives  mix shift to higher margin products  and a series of operational excellence initiatives such as better supplier management including outsourcing  veeco s continued focus on operational improvements and cost control resulted in an increase in gross margins to in from in the prior year  net loss was million in compared to a net loss of million in  net loss per share was compared to a loss of in  and veeco generated million of cash during  after the effect of making earn out payments totaling million relating to acquisitions 
inventory was reduced by million from million at december  to million at december  outlook opportunities in  veeco will continue its strategy for growth as well as its focus on improving profitability and gross margin performance 
as veeco enters  the company sees positive market conditions across our core markets data storage  hb led  semiconductor and scientific research  which  combined with significant new product introductions expected from both our process equipment and metrology business units  should provide ample opportunity for revenue growth 
in addition  consumer spending on many types of electronics has increased and various worldwide economies  such as those in the asia pacific region  are experiencing growth 
the company reviews a number of indicators to predict the strength of our markets going forward 
these include plant utilization trends  capacity requirements and capital spending trends 
at the beginning of  many of these trends appear quite positive 
technology changes are continuing in all of veeco s markets the continued increase of gb hard drives and investment in gb hard drives in data storage  the increased usage of mini drives in consumer electronic applications  the increased use of veeco s automated afms for sub nanometer semiconductor applications  the opportunity for veeco s mocvd and mbe to further penetrate the emerging wireless and hb led market 
veeco believes that these changes  together with the estimated funding of nanoscience research  will prompt our customers to seek our next generation solutions to address their manufacturing and technology challenges 
veeco will continue its focus on increasing shareholder value through operational excellence and cash generation 
the company s goal is to increase gross margins again in  with improvements in both process equipment and metrology 
veeco anticipates that progress in this area will continue to come from activities such as better supply chain management  including outsourcing of new products  and development of common hardware and software platforms

metrology sales increased by to million in  from million in  primarily due to increased purchases in the semiconductor and data storage markets 
epitaxial process equipment sales were down million in  or  due to a million reduction of sales of mocvd products  primarily to customers in the hb led wireless industry  and a million reduction in mbe sales attributable to less purchases by customers in the research and industrial and hb led wireless industries 
in  we continued to experience a shift in sales from the us to the asia pacific region  which experienced increased sales of million in compared to  due to the manufacturing base shifts noted above 
the company believes that there will continue to be period to period variations in the geographic distribution of sales 
orders of million in were down as compared to by segment  orders in ion beam and mechanical process equipment increased by  due to improved data storage industry conditions resulting from the expanded use of hard drives in consumer electronics 
orders in the metrology segment increased by  due primarily to higher demand in the data storage and semiconductor industries 
the reduction in epitaxial process equipment orders was primarily due to a million decrease in hb led orders for mocvd systems 
by industry  orders from data storage customers increased on higher deposition and etch orders 
hb led wireless orders decreased predominantly due to a significant reduction in demand for mocvd systems 
regionally  the decline in orders in the us of and the increase in orders to the asia pacific region of is mostly the result of a continued shift to overseas production by our customers  primarily in the data storage industry 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december   which is calculated by dividing orders received in a given time period by revenue recognized in that same time period  was 
to during the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  primarily in the data storage and hb led wireless industries 
the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
due to changing business conditions and customer requirements  the company may continue to experience cancellations and or rescheduling of orders 
gross profit for the year ended december   increased as a percentage of net sales to from in gross profit was million in  compared to million in the increase in gross margins was partially attributed to a product mix shift from lower gross margin process equipment products to the higher gross margin metrology products 
the percentage of total sales for metrology products increased from in to in  which represents a million increase in revenue 
process equipment product sales remained flat when compared to  but as a percentage of total sales declined from in to in ion beam and mechanical process equipment gross margins increased to from in  primarily due to an increase in sales volume of million  cost reductions and improved supply chain management which included outsourcing 
gross profit in was negatively impacted by million in purchase accounting adjustments relating to the acquisition of aii 
metrology gross margins decreased slightly from in to in primarily due to an unfavorable afm product mix 
epitaxial process equipment margins declined from in to in  due to a million decline in sales volume  partially offset by a reduction in warranty and material costs 
gross profit in was negatively impacted by million in purchase accounting adjustments relating to the acquisition of turbodisc 
these purchase accounting adjustments resulted from the required capitalization of profit in inventory and the permanent elimination of certain deferred revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or in principally due to higher personnel costs  including increased bonus and profit sharing expenses and additional epitaxial management totaling million  as well as an increase in legal and insurance costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in selling expenses of million resulting from reduced personnel and a reduction in commissions expense of million due to the continued shift in revenues to the asia pacific region  where commission rates are lower 
research and development expense totaled million or of sales in  compared with million or of sales in this million increase in spending principally resulted from new product development in the ion beam and epitaxial process equipment segments as well as incremental costs attributable to the mti acquisition in october amortization expense totaled million or of sales in  compared with million or of sales in this million decrease is attributable to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized 
other expense  net  was million in compared with other income  net of million in the change is primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses and a loss realized on the sale of fixed assets 
the company incurred merger  restructuring and other expenses of million during  which consisted of personnel severance costs related to consolidation and cost reduction actions 
as of december   million of these severance charges are included in accrued expenses  and are expected to be paid by the fourth quarter of during  the company incurred million of merger  restructuring and other expenses  which was comprised of million in severance related to a reduction in employment in the fourth quarter of and million for costs related to the internal investigation of improper accounting transactions at turbodisc 
as of december   the entire amount of these charges had been paid 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
asset impairment charges of million in related to the consolidation of the aii and mti businesses and to certain long lived assets of aii that were classified as held for sale as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 these long lived assets were measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the million write off of purchased in process technology in resulted from the mti acquisition of projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternate uses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details on the projects included 
interest income totaled million compared to million in the comparable period 
the change is due to the increase in interest rates and higher cash balances invested during income taxes for the year ended december   amounted to million  or of income before income taxes as compared to million  or of loss before income taxes in see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
the provision for income taxes included million relating to our foreign operations  which are profitable  and million relating to our domestic operations  which incurred a taxable loss 
a portion of the domestic loss was taxable 
the provision for income taxes in included a million charge due to providing a full valuation allowance on its domestic net deferred tax assets  and foreign taxes of million partially offset by income tax benefits derived from a domestic net operating loss

the mocvd and aii product lines were each acquired in the fourth quarter of  and therefore a significant portion of the sales increase is due to twelve months of results in compared to less than a full fiscal quarter in metrology sales increased by to million in from million in we continue to experience a shift in sales from the us to the asia pacific region  which region increased sales by million in compared to  due to the acquired companies and the manufacturing base shifts noted above 
the company believes that there will continue to be period to period variations in the geographic distribution of sales 
orders of million in were a increase as compared to by segment  orders in ion beam and mechanical process equipment increased by due to improved data storage industry conditions resulting from the expanded use of hard drives in consumer electronics 
the improvement in epitaxial process equipment orders was driven by million in orders for mocvd systems for production of hb led 
this increase was due to the full year impact of mocvd activities in  as the product line was acquired in the fourth quarter of by industry  data storage increased on higher deposition and etch orders 
semiconductor increased mostly due to a million increase in metrology orders  an million increase in deposition and etch orders  and million of mocvd orders from the turbodisc acquisition partially offset by a million decrease in mbe orders 
hb led wireless orders increased predominantly due to a million increase in mocvd 
regionally  the increase in orders in the u 
s and to the asia pacific region is mostly due to the increase in mocvd orders 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december   which is calculated by dividing orders received in a given time period by revenue recognized in that same time period  was to during the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  primarily in the data storage and hb led wireless industries 
the company acquired million of backlog as a result of the acquisition of mti in the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
due to changing business conditions and customer requirements  the company may continue to experience cancellations and or rescheduling of orders 
gross profit for the year ended december   decreased as a percentage of net sales to from in gross profit was million in compared to million in during the years ended december  and december   the company incurred reductions in gross profit related to the acquisitions of turbodisc and aii of million and million  respectively 
the reductions were the result of purchase accounting adjustments due to the required capitalization of profit in inventory and permanent elimination of certain deferred revenue  which is included in cost of sales 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in this decrease was mostly due to a product mix shift from the higher margin metrology segment to the lower margin ion beam and mechanical process equipment and epitaxial process equipment segments  largely due to the acquisitions 
the metrology percentage of total sales declined from in to in the ion beam and mechanical process equipment margins decreased from to 
this reduction was principally due to an unfavorable product mix including lower margins for certain advance development products 
epitaxial process equipment margins declined from in to in the mocvd margins were negatively impacted by high warranty and material costs 
the metrology gross margin for was  compared with in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or in  principally due to incremental costs of million attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions  with the balance attributable to higher selling expenses related to the increase in sales  as well as consulting and audit costs related to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
research and development expense totaled million or of sales in  compared with million or of sales in this million increase in spending principally resulted from million of incremental costs attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
other income  net  decreased by million primarily due to lower gains realized on the sale of assets held for sale in than in the company incurred merger  restructuring and other expenses of million during  comprised of million in severance related to a reduction in employment in the fourth quarter of and million for costs related to the internal investigation of improper accounting transactions at turbodisc 
the million charge for severance related costs include approximately management  administration and manufacturing employees located at the company s plainview  new york and camarillo  california ion beam and mechanical process equipment operations  the somerset  new jersey and st 
paul  minnesota epitaxial process equipment operations  the santa barbara  california and tucson  arizona metrology facilities  the sales and service offices located in france  england and singapore  and the corporate office in woodbury  new york 
as of december   approximately million had been paid and approximately million remained accrued 
the remainder was paid by the fourth quarter of as of december   the million investigation costs remained accrued  and were paid by the second quarter of asset impairment charges of million in related to the consolidation of the aii and mti business and pertained to certain long lived assets of aii that were classified as held for sale as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 these long lived assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the merger  restructuring and other expenses of million in was primarily due to severance costs related to the actions announced in the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
the million write off of purchased in process technology for resulted from the mti acquisition for projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternate uses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details on the projects included 
expenditures to complete mti s projects are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurances can be given that deviations from the estimated completion dates will not occur 
additionally  the projects will require maintenance research and development spending after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
there are risks associated with these projects and there is no assurance that these projects will be technologically feasible or commercially successful 
in  the company wrote off million of purchased in process technology from the turbodisc and aii acquisitions in the amount of million and million  respectively 
accordingly  these amounts were expensed at the acquisition dates 
as of december   all of the projects related to these charges have either been completed or cancelled 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details on the projects included 
interest income totaled million compared to million in the comparable period 
the change is due to the lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by million in interest income on a federal income tax refund received in the third quarter of income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million  or of loss before income taxes  as compared with a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes in the difference between the statutory tax benefit and the effective tax rate in was primarily a result of an increase of million in the valuation allowance for its domestic deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
liquidity and capital resources veeco s primary source of funds at december   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
this amount represents an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
the increase included million of earn out payments to the former owners of the businesses acquired in see below 
the company s primary future cash commitment is in  when the million of convertible subordinated notes mature 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share and are redeemable by veeco under certain circumstances 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
cash provided by operations totaled million during the year ended december  of the cash generated  million was derived from adjusting the net loss of million for non cash charges of million  including million in depreciation and amortization expense 
the balance of million is from changes in operating assets and liabilities  including cash generated from a decrease in inventories of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by cash used from an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in net other current assets and liabilities of million 
inventories decreased as each business segment has continued to focus on operational improvements including outsourcing  lean manufacturing and standardization of platforms  as well as an increase in sales volume over the prior year 
accounts receivable increased primarily as a result of higher sales volume 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily attributable to the timing of payments principally due to improved cash management techniques 
the increase in net other current assets and liabilities is mainly a result of increased costs in capitalized software  as well as prepaid insurance and a foreign currency translation gain related to forward contracts 
cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december   is a result of earn out payments of million to the former owner of the mocvd business unit  and million to the previous shareholders of nanodevices inc plus capital expenditures of million 
partially offsetting these cash uses were proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment and assets held for sale of million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  primarily from common stock issuances related to employee exercise of stock options and purchase of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
on december   the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes  and on january   the company issued an additional million of notes pursuant to an over allotment option 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year 
the notes will mature on december  the notes are subordinated in right of payment to substantially all other indebtedness of the company 
the notes are repayable upon certain change of control events and upon the acceleration of certain other indebtedness 
after december  the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture relating to the notes 
during the first quarter of  the company repurchased million of its convertible subordinated notes for million in cash  of which million related to principal and million related to accrued interest 
as a result of the repurchase of this debt  the company recorded a gain from the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company will report this gain as part of operating income 
the company may engage in similar transactions in the future depending on market conditions  its cash position and other factors 
on march   the company entered into a revolving credit facility  which provides for borrowings of up to million the facility 
the facility s annual interest rate is a floating rate equal to the prime rate of the agent bank plus and is adjustable to a minimum rate equal to the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flow is below a defined amount 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
the facility has a term of three years and borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which among other requirements  impose limitations with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness  the payment of dividends  long term leases  investments  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of assets 
the company is required to satisfy certain financial tests under the facility and substantially all of the assets of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries  other than real estate  have been pledged to secure the company s obligations under the facility 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
the company had unsecured letters of credit outstanding at december  in the amount of million 
on march   the company terminated its previous million revolving credit facility which had been established on april  the old facility 
for all periods during and  no borrowings were outstanding under the old facility 
at december   veeco s contractual cash obligations and commitments are as follows in thousands contractual cash obligations and commitments total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on debt operating leases earn out features on acquisitions letters of credit purchase commitments the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the company s million facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements for the next twelve months  as well as the company s contractual obligations  detailed in the above table 
the company believes it will be able to meet its obligation to repay the million subordinated notes that mature on december  through a combination of conversion of the notes outstanding  refinancing  cash generated from operations  and or other means 
the company is liable for payment of certain earn out provisions at december  to the former shareholders of nanodevices inc for million and to the former owner of turbodisc for million 
such amounts have been accrued at december  and are payable during the first quarter of in addition  the company is potentially liable for earn out payments to the former shareholders of aii based on achieving revenue in excess of certain targets for it is not possible to calculate the amounts  if any  that may be due to the former shareholders of aii  however the company does not anticipate making any significant payments relating to such arrangement 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
on december  and  respectively  the company entered into forward contracts for the month of january of each of and  respectively  for the notional amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  which approximated the respective fair market value at december  and application of critical accounting policies general veeco s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires veeco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring costs and contingent litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  the valuation of inventories  the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the impairment of long lived assets  warranty costs and the accounting for deferred taxes to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
a multiple element arrangement is a transaction which may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets  and performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products produced according to the company s published specifications  where no installation is required or installation is deemed perfunctory and no substantive customer acceptance provisions exist  revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product has been tested and it has been demonstrated that it meets the customer s specifications and title passes to the customer 
the amount of revenue recorded is reduced by the amount of any customer retention generally to  which is not payable by the customer until installation is completed and final customer acceptance is achieved 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the equipment since installation does not involve significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment or building complex interfaces and connections 
in addition  the equipment could be installed by the customer or other vendors and generally the cost of installation approximates only to of the sales value of the related equipment 
for new products  new applications of existing products  or for products with substantive customer acceptance provisions where performance cannot be fully assessed prior to meeting customer specifications at the customer site  revenue is recognized upon completion of installation and receipt of final customer acceptance 
since title to goods generally passes to the customer upon shipment and to of the contract amount becomes payable at that time  inventory is relieved and accounts receivable is recorded for the amount billed at the time of shipment 
the profit on the amount billed for these transactions is deferred and recorded as deferred profit in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  are recorded in deferred profit 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue  which is included in other accrued expenses  and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out method or market 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage for the next to month s requirements is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to veeco s future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if it is determined that impairment indicators are present and that the assets will not be fully recoverable  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments  and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these assumptions  and thus veeco may be required to record impairment charges for those assets not previously recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  and  as required  the company performed an annual impairment test  and based upon the judgment of management  it was determined that no impairment exists 
long lived asset impairment the carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment indicators are present 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining depreciation period  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments  and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
assumptions utilized by management in reviewing for impairment of long lived assets could be effected by changes in strategy and or market conditions which may require veeco to record additional impairment charges for these assets  as well as impairment charges on other long lived assets not previously recorded 
during  million in fixed asset impairment charges were recorded by the company related to the consolidation of the aii and mti business 
no asset impairment charges were recorded during and warranty costs the company estimates the costs that may be incurred under the warranty it provides and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the related revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as the company s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance as part of the process of preparing veeco s consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which the future tax benefits will be recognized on a more likely than not basis 
our net deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and timing differences between the book and tax treatment of inventory and other asset valuations 
realization of these net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
we record valuation allowances in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of recorded valuation allowances  we consider a variety of factors  including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
under sfas no 
 factors such as current and previous operating losses are given significantly greater weight than the outlook for future profitability in determining the deferred tax asset carrying value 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a charge of approximately million to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of its domestic net deferred tax assets  which consist of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as temporary deductible differences 
at december  the company s valuation allowance was million 
the valuation allowance of million at december  increased by approximately million in  principally due to the benefit derived from the extraterritorial income exclusion and additional foreign tax credits 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which places primary importance on the company s historical results of operations 
although the company s results in prior years were significantly affected by restructuring and other charges  the company s historical loss and the losses incurred in and represent negative evidence sufficient to require a full valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas no 
if the company is able to realize part or all of the deferred tax assets in future periods  it will reduce its provision for income taxes with a release of the valuation allowance in an amount that corresponds with the income tax liability generated

for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company will adopt statement no

r 
as permitted by statement no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will impact consolidated results of operations by approximately million in and approximately million in  for options that are unvested as of january  the impact of future share based awards cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per common share in note to veeco s consolidated financial statements 
statement no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce consolidated net operating cash flows and increase consolidated net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of consolidated operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million in in november  the fasb issued statement no

veeco s investment portfolios at december  and december  consist of cash equivalents 
assuming year end variable debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on net interest expense 
in december and january  the company issued an aggregate of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year

foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on veeco is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors

to mitigate these risks  veeco uses derivative financial instruments 
veeco does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company enters into monthly forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short term foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known currency exposures 
the average notional amount of such contracts outstanding was approximately million for the year ended december  the changes in currency exchange rates that have the largest impact on translating veeco s international operating loss profit are the japanese yen and the euro 
the company believes that based upon its hedging program  a change in foreign exchange rates would have an immaterial impact on the consolidated results of operations 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies
