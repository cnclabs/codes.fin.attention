item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allegheny technologies incorporated ati uses innovative technologies to produce a wide range of specialty metals for global markets 
our specialty metals are produced in a variety of alloys and forms  and are selected for use in environments that demand materials having exceptional hardness  toughness  strength  resistance to heat  corrosion or abrasion  or a combination of these characteristics 
major end markets of our products include aerospace  defense  chemical processing  oil and gas  electrical energy  construction and mining  automotive  food processing equipment and appliances  machine and cutting tools  transportation  and medical industries 
unless the context requires otherwise  ati  we  our  us and similar terms refer to allegheny technologies incorporated and its subsidiaries 
certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those described below 
overview in  we focused on accelerating ati s profitability 
net income for the full year was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for sales increased to billion for as higher base selling prices  the effect of raw material surcharges  and higher shipments for most of our major products resulted from improved business conditions in most of the major markets we serve 
sales for our high performance metals segment improved to a record level of billion primarily due to continuing strong demand from the aerospace and medical markets for our titanium alloys  nickel based superalloys and vacuum melted specialty alloys  and continued strong demand for our exotic materials  especially from the defense and chemical processing markets 
operating profit for the high performance metals segment improved to million  a increase compared to  due primarily to the improved pricing and increased shipments resulting from the increase in demand and the benefits from our cost reduction efforts  partially offset by the impact on the lifo inventory accounting methodology from rising raw material costs 
in our flat rolled products segment  demand for our commodity stainless steel sheet products was soft in the second half of  following a strong first half  as a result of inventory management actions at service centers and elsewhere in the supply chain 
overall for  sales for our flat rolled products segment increased to billion due to the improvement in the us industrial economy  especially in most capital goods markets 
this improvement in demand for the year and higher base prices for most of the products of our flat rolled products segment  along with our acquisition of certain manufacturing assets of j l specialty steel llc j l in mid  and the benefits of cost reductions and lower costs for certain raw materials  offset the negative effects of higher energy costs  resulting in an operating profit for this segment of million for compared to million in results for our engineered products segment also improved  as sales increased to million  or compared to  and operating profit increased to million  a increase  due to improved demand from the oil and gas  construction and transportation markets  plus the benefits from our cost reduction actions  which offset the impact of rising raw material costs under the lifo inventory accounting methodology 
segment operating profit increased by million  compared to this significant improvement in segment profitability was achieved despite the negative impact from lifo inventory reserve charges of million  due to higher overall raw material costs  and higher energy costs of million  which partially offset the benefits of million in gross cost reductions 
retirement benefit expenses decreased in to million  compared to million in  primarily as a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets during  actions taken in the second quarter to control retiree medical costs  and the favorable effect of the medicare prescription drug legislation  partially offset by the use of a lower discount rate assumption for determining benefit plan liabilities 
during  we continued to enhance our leading market positions  reduce costs  and improve our balance sheet 
we also realized continued success in implementing the ati business system  which is driving lean manufacturing throughout our operations 
our accomplishments during from these important efforts included the following we continued to grow our global market presence as international sales reached a record million  or of total sales  an increase of million compared to in july  we announced a major expansion of our titanium production capabilities 
we intend to invest approximately million through the end of to significantly increase our capacity to produce titanium and titanium alloys used for aero engine rotating parts  airframe applications  and in other global markets 
we expect more than million of annual revenue growth potential when these projects are fully implemented in we expect to fund these capital expenditures through internal cash flow 
strategic capital projects associated with expanding our titanium production capabilities include 
table of contents upgrading and restarting approximately one half of the capacity of our idled titanium sponge facility in albany  oregon 
we expect an annual production rate of million pounds of titanium sponge from this facility beginning in the first half of titanium sponge is an important raw material used to produce our titanium mill products 
constructing a third plasma arc melt cold hearth furnace at ati allvac s north carolina operations 
we expect this new furnace to be qualified for production by late plasma arc melting is a superior cold hearth melt process for making alloyed titanium products for aero engine rotating parts and biomedical applications 
expanding high value plate products capacity by  primarily through investments at our plate products facilities in western pennsylvania 
continued upgrading of our cold rolling assets used in producing titanium sheet and strip products 
in september  we announced an expansion of our premium melt nickel based alloy  superalloy  and specialty alloy production capabilities 
these investments are aimed at increasing our capacity to produce these high performance alloys used for aero engine rotating parts  airframe applications  oil and gas exploration  extraction and refining  power generation land based turbines and flue gas desulfurization pollution control units 
these incremental capital investments of approximately million through the end of are expected to be funded from internal cash flow 
we expect approximately million of annual revenue from these projects when they are implemented 
major projects of this expansion  which is expected to increase our premium melt capacity by approximately  include upgrading and expanding vacuum induction melt vim capacity 
vim is a melting process designed for premium grades with high alloy content that require more precise chemistry control and lower impurity levels 
installation of two new electro slag re melt esr furnaces and three new vacuum arc re melt var furnaces 
esr and var furnaces are consumable electrode re melting processes used to improve both the cleanliness and metallurgical structure of alloys 
in april  we continued to grow our engineered products segment by acquiring garryson limited  a leading uk based producer of tungsten carbide burrs  rotary tooling and specialty abrasive wheels and discs  for approximately million in cash 
garryson had sales of over million in the acquired operations were integrated into ati s metalworking products operation 
we realized gross cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  of million in  substantially exceeding our goal of million 
over the past four years  we have reduced our salaried staffing levels by approximately and our hourly staffing levels by  including businesses acquired 
we continued to realize significant improvement in safety 
as a result of our continuing focus on and commitment to safety  in our osha total recordable incident rate improved by and our lost time case rate improved by  both compared to our baseline 
we continued to strengthen our balance sheet as the significant improvement in operating results allowed us to internally fund our capital needs  invest an additional million in managed working capital  and make a million voluntary cash contribution to our us defined benefit pension plan to improve its funded position 
cash on hand at the end of was million  an increase of million from year end our net debt to total capitalization improved to at december   compared to and at year end and  respectively 
we enhanced our financial liquidity by amending our million secured domestic revolving credit facility in august to extend the term of the credit facility to august  add flexibility to execute various corporate actions without the prior consent of the bank group  reduce the costs of the credit facility  and incorporate a feature that would permit us to increase the size of the credit facility by up to million  assuming we had sufficient collateral 
we have not borrowed under this credit facility or its predecessor since it was established in  although a portion of the facility has been utilized to support the issuance of letters of credit 
with the continuing strength in our major end markets and confidence in ati s ability to continue to generate strong cash flow over the next several years  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by to per share in december as a result of these accomplishments  we believe that ati should benefit from continuing strong business conditions in in most of our major markets aerospace  defense  chemical process industry  oil and gas  electrical energy  and medical 
our investments in high value titanium products and nickel based alloys and superalloys are on schedule and are expected to impact results during the second half of we expect to improve on the profitable growth achieved in we expect cash flow to be strong in enabling us to continue to make strategic investments and improve the balance sheet 
we have targeted million of capital investments in in a self funded growth strategy 
we remain focused on cost reductions and have established a cost reduction goal of million  before the effects of inflation 
we remain dedicated to our disciplined plan and vision as we move to the profitable growth phase of building the world s best specialty metals company

in the fourth quarter  based on existing and projected operating levels at our remaining operations in houston  pa  and at our washington flat roll coil facility located in washington  pa  we determined that the net book values of these facilities were in excess of their estimated fair market values based on expected future cash flows 
charges for the houston facility and the washington flat roll coil facility were recorded to write down the net book values of these facilities to their estimated fair market values 
these asset impairment charges did not impact current operations at these facilities 
the workforce reductions affected approximately employees across all segments and the corporate office 
approximately million of the severance charges was paid from the company s pension plan  and at december   approximately million of these prior year workforce reduction and facility closure charges are future cash costs that will be paid over the next several years 
cash to meet these obligations is expected to be paid from internally generated funds from operations 
other expenses  net of gains on asset sales other expenses  net of gains on asset sales  includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations  pretax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate  non strategic investments and other assets  operating results from equity method investees  minority interest  and other non operating income or expense 
these items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses  and in other income expense in the statement of operations and resulted in a net charge of million in  other income of million in  and a net charge of million in other expenses for included million for legal matters and million for environmental and other closed company costs 
the charges for legal matters included the settlement of the kaiser aerospace electronics matter  the unfavorable court judgment rendered in april concerning a commercial dispute with a raw materials supplier  and other matters associated with closed companies  and are classified in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
see additional discussion in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in  other expenses for closed companies included a charge of million related to litigation with the san diego unified port district  as more fully described in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and which is included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations  and changes in our estimates of our liability for environmental closure costs and for liabilities under retrospectively rated insurance programs 
retirement benefit expense retirement benefit expense  which primarily includes pension and postretirement medical benefits  declined in and primarily as a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets during and  actions taken in the second quarter to control retiree medical costs  and the favorable impact of the medicare prescription drug legislation  partially offset by the use of progressively lower discount rate assumptions for determining benefit plan liabilities 
retirement benefit expense  excluding the effect of curtailment gains and termination benefit charges  was million for  million for  and million for the effect of the medicare prescription drug legislation  which provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law  is recognized in the financial statements over a number of years 
retirement benefit expenses are included in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses 
retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended  and was as follows in millions cost of sales selling and administrative expenses total retirement benefit expense the retirement benefit expense shown above does not include the effects of the million curtailment and settlement gain related to the elimination of retiree medical benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees beginning in  nor does this expense include the million charge related to the transition assistance program tap incentives associated with the new labor agreement at allegheny ludlum  which was paid from our us defined benefit pension plan 
retirement benefit expenses for are expected to be approximately million  with effects on cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses similar to the percentages in pension expense for is expected to be approximately million compared to million in as the positive benefits of the voluntary million pension contribution and higher than expected returns on pension assets in are offset by the use of a lower assumed discount rate to value pension liabilities 
postretirement medical expense for is expected to increase to approximately million from million in due primarily to a lower expected return on plan assets as a result of lower plan asset levels  and the use of a lower assumed discount rate to value obligations 
income taxes results of operations for included an income tax benefit of million principally caused by the reversal of the remaining valuation allowance for our us federal net deferred tax assets  partially offset by accruals for us federal  foreign and state income taxes 
results of operations for did not include an income tax provision or benefit for current or deferred taxes primarily as a result of the uncertainty regarding full utilization of the net deferred tax asset and available operating loss carryforwards 
from the fourth quarter through the third quarter of  we maintained a valuation allowance for a major portion of our us federal deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  due to uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax asset  including the and unutilized net operating losses of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter we had recorded a million valuation allowance for the majority of our net deferred tax asset  based upon the results of our quarterly evaluation concerning the estimated probability that the net deferred tax asset would be realizable in light of our history of annual reported losses in the years through in  we generated taxable income which exceeded the and net operating losses allowing us to fully realize these tax benefits 
this realization of tax benefits  together with our improved profitability  allowed us to reverse the remaining valuation allowance for us federal income taxes in the fourth quarter 
our income tax provision for was million 
in and  we received million and million  respectively  in income tax refunds related to carrying back the previous year s taxable loss to earlier years in which we had paid taxes 

table of contents deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes  and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases 
deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
a significant portion of our deferred tax assets relates to the postretirement benefit obligations  which have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements but which are not recognized for income tax reporting purposes until the benefits are paid 
these benefit payments are expected to occur over an extended period of years 
financial condition and liquidity we believe that internally generated funds  current cash on hand and available borrowings under existing secured credit lines will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs 
we did not borrow funds under our domestic secured credit facility during  or however  a portion of this secured credit facility is utilized to support letters of credit 
our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be influenced by our credit rating 
as of december   standard poor s ratings services corporate credit rating for our company was bb with a stable outlook and our senior unsecured debt was rated bb 
as of december   moody s investor service s corporate family rating for our company was ba with a stable outlook  and our senior unsecured note rating was ba changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to  or the cost of  our existing credit facilities 
we have no off balance sheet financing relationships with variable interest or structured finance entities 
cash flow and working capital in  cash generated by operations of million  the proceeds from exercises of stock options of million and tax benefits on share based compensation of million were used to invest million in capital equipment  fund a million voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit pension plan  pay million for the acquisition of the garryson limited operation  repay debt of million  pay dividends of million  and increase cash balances by million  to million at december  in  cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from sale of common stock of million  proceeds from asset sales of million  and proceeds from exercises of stock options of million  were used to invest in capital equipment  fund a million voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit pension plan  pay million of the purchase price for the j l assets  repay debt of million  pay dividends of million  and increase cash balances by million  to million at december  we use cash flow from operations before voluntary pension plan contributions in order to evaluate and compare fiscal periods that do not include these contributions  and to make resource allocation decisions among operational requirements  investing and financing alternatives 
bar chart managed working capital millions millions of revenue the impact of improved operating results in on cash flow from operations was offset by continuing investment in managed working capital to support the higher business levels and the impact of higher costs for certain raw materials 
as part of managing the liquidity of the business  we focus on controlling inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
in measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital  we exclude the effects of the lifo inventory valuation reserves  excess and obsolete inventory reserves  and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which  due to their nature  are managed separately 
during  managed working capital  which we define as gross inventory plus accounts receivable less accounts payable  increased by million  excluding working capital acquired as part of the garryson limited acquisition 
this increase in managed working capital resulted from a million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of  and a million increase in inventory mostly as a result of higher costs for certain raw materials and increased business volumes  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable 
most of the increase in raw materials is expected to be recovered through surcharge and index pricing mechanisms 
managed working capital has increased million over the past three years as our level of business activity has improved and raw material costs have increased 
this increase in managed working capital is expected to represent a future source of cash if the level of business activity were to decline 
managed working capital as a percent of annualized sales was  at the end of  in  and in the increase in of managed working capital as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher business activity in the high performance metals segment  which has a longer manufacturing cycle 
while inventory and accounts receivable balances increased during  and  both gross inventory turns  which exclude the effect of lifo inventory valuation reserves  and days sales outstanding  which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable  have improved over the past three years 

table of contents the components of managed working capital were as follows december  december  december  in millions accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable subtotal allowance for doubtful accounts lifo reserve corporate and other managed working capital annualized prior months sales managed working capital as a of sales capital expenditures for were million  compared to million for and million for in july  we announced a major expansion of our titanium production capabilities 
we intend to invest approximately million through the end of to significantly increase our capacity to produce titanium and titanium alloys used for aero engine rotating parts  airframe applications and in other global markets 
we expect over million of annual revenue growth potential when these projects are fully implemented in we expect to fund these capital expenditures through internal cash flow 
strategic capital projects associated with expanding our titanium production capabilities include upgrading and restarting approximately one half of the capacity of our idled titanium sponge facility in albany  oregon 
we expect an annual production rate of million pounds of titanium sponge from this facility beginning in the first half of titanium sponge is a critical material used to produce titanium mill products 
constructing a third plasma arc melt cold hearth furnace at ati allvac s north carolina operations 
we expect this new furnace to be qualified for production by late plasma arc melting is a superior cold hearth melt process for making alloyed titanium products for aero engine rotating parts and biomedical applications 
expanding high value plate products capacity by  primarily through investments at our plate products facilities in western pennsylvania 
continued upgrading of our flat rolled cold rolling assets used in producing titanium sheet and strip products 
in september  we announced an expansion of our premium melt nickel based alloy  superalloy  and specialty alloy production capabilities 
these investments are aimed at increasing our capacity to produce these high performance alloys used for aero engine rotating parts  airframe applications  oil and gas exploration  extraction and refining  power generation land based turbines and flue gas desulfurization pollution control units 
these incremental capital investments of approximately million through the end of are expected to be funded from internal cash flow 
we expect approximately million of annual revenue from these projects when they are implemented 
major projects of this expansion  which is expected to increase our premium melt capacity by approximately  include upgrading and expanding vacuum induction melt vim capacity 
vim is a melting process designed for premium grades with high alloy content that require more precise chemistry control and lower impurity levels 
installation of two new electro slag re melt esr furnaces and three new vacuum arc re melt var furnaces 
esr and var furnaces are consumable electrode re melting processes used to improve both the cleanliness and metallurgical structure of alloys 
in  we completed our two major strategic capital projects begun in two new electric arc furnaces at our flat rolled products melt shop located in brackenridge  pa  and investments to enhance the capabilities at our high performance metals long products rolling mill facility located in richburg  sc 
the second electric arc furnace in the flat rolled products segment commenced operations in the third quarter  with the first new furnace having commenced production in the fourth quarter 
the high performance metals long products facility commenced operations in the second quarter 
capital expenditures for are expected to approximate million 

table of contents debt total debt outstanding decreased million  to million at december   from million at december  the decrease was primarily related to a payment for the j l asset acquisition and a reduction in our foreign borrowings 
in managing our overall capital structure  one of the measures on which we focus is net debt to total capitalization  which is the percentage of our debt  net of cash on hand  to our total invested and borrowed capital 
in determining this measure  debt and total capitalization are net of cash on hand which may be available to reduce borrowings 
our net debt to total capitalization ratio improved to at december   from at december   and from at the end of the lower ratio in results primarily from an increase in cash on hand and stockholders equity resulting from the improvement in results of operations  plus the reduction in outstanding debt 
the ratio declined in primarily due to an increase in cash on hand and stockholders equity resulting from the common stock offering and the improvement in results of operations  partially offset by an increase in debt due primarily to the seller financing for the j l asset acquisition 
december  december  in millions total debt less cash net debt net debt total stockholders equity total capital net debt to capital ratio on august   we amended our senior secured domestic revolving credit facility to extend the facility term to august from its original maturity date of june  enable us to execute various corporate actions without the prior consent of the lending group  so long as  after giving effect to such corporate action  we maintain a minimum undrawn availability as described in the facility of million  reduce the borrowing costs under the facility  and incorporate a feature that would permit us to increase the size of the facility  assuming we had sufficient collateral  by up to million 
under the amended facility  if undrawn availability as described in the facility were to decline below million  corporate actions that could be undertaken without the prior consent of the lending group  including capital expenditures  acquisitions  sales of assets  dividends  investments in  or loans to  corporations  partnerships  joint ventures and subsidiaries  issuance of unsecured indebtedness  leases  and prepayment of indebtedness  would be limited 
the amended facility contains a financial covenant  which is not measured unless our undrawn availability is less than million 
this financial covenant  when measured  requires us to prospectively maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility to fixed charges of at least to from the date the covenant is measured 
our ability to borrow under the amended secured credit facility in the future could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain the applicable covenants under the agreement governing the facility 
at december   we had the ability to access the entire million undrawn availability under the facility 
interest rate swap contracts are used from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
in  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with respect to a million notional amount related to our notes due notes  which involved the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the contracts without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
these receive fixed  pay floating arrangements were designated as fair value hedges  and effectively converted million of the notes to variable rate debt 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the swap contracts and the notional amount of the underlying fixed rate debt are recognized in the statement of operations 
in  we terminated the majority of these interest rate swap contracts and received million in cash 
subsequent to the interest rate swap terminations  in we entered into new receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap arrangements related to the notes which re established  in total  a million notional amount that effectively converted this portion of the notes to variable rate debt 
in the third quarter in light of the prospect of increasing short term interest rates  we terminated all remaining interest rate swap contracts still outstanding  and realized net cash proceeds of million 
these gains on settlement realized in and remain a component of the reported balance of the notes  and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes  which is approximately six years 
at december   the deferred settlement gain was million 
the result of the receive fixed  pay floating arrangements was a decrease in interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to the fixed interest expense of the ten year notes

retirement benefits as of november   our measurement date for pension accounting  the value of the accumulated pension benefit obligation abo for our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the value of pension investments by approximately million 
a minimum pension liability was recognized in as a result of a severe decline in the equity markets from through  higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in  and a lower assumed discount rate for valuing the pension liabilities 
accounting standards require that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension investments is less than the abo at the annual measurement date 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge against stockholders equity of million  net of deferred taxes  to write off our prepaid pension cost representing the previous overfunded portion of the pension plan  and to record a deferred pension asset for unamortized prior service cost relating to prior benefit enhancements 
in the fourth quarter of  and  our adjustments of the minimum pension liability resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of million for  and increases to stockholders equity of million for and million for these minimum pension liability adjustments are presented as other comprehensive income loss 
the recognition of the minimum pension liability in  and the adjustments of the minimum pension liability in  and do not affect our reported results of operations and do not have a cash impact 
in accordance with current accounting standards  the full charge against stockholders equity would be reversed in subsequent years if the value of pension plan investments returns to a level that exceeds the abo as of a future annual measurement date 
as of the annual measurement date  the value of pension investments was billion and the abo was billion 
based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts  the abo is projected to be approximately billion at the annual measurement date  assuming no changes in the discount rate used to value benefit obligations 

table of contents we were not required to make cash contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan for or during the fourth quarter and the third quarter  we made voluntary contributions to this defined benefit pension plan of million and million  respectively  to improve the plan s funded position 
based on current regulations and actuarial studies  we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan during the next several years 
however  a significant decline in the value of plan investments in the future  or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
depending on the timing and amount  a requirement that we fund our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may elect  depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors  to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future 
we fund certain retiree health care benefits for allegheny ludlum using investments held in a voluntary employee benefit association veba trust 
this allows us to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs 
in accordance with our labor agreements  during  and  we funded million  million and million  respectively  of retiree medical costs using the investments of the veba trust 
we may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in the veba if the value of these investments exceeds million 
the value of the investments held in the veba was approximately million as of november  dividends we paid a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock for each of the quarters of and for the first three quarters of in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors increased the cash dividend paid on our common stock to per share 
the payment of dividends and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our board of directors  such as our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  any limitations imposed by credit agreements or senior securities  and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is recognized when title passes or as services are rendered 
we have no significant unusual sale arrangements with any of our customers 
we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states 
trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each customer s ability to perform its obligations  which are updated periodically 
accounts receivable reserves are based upon an aging of accounts and a review for collectibility of specific accounts 
accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of million at december  and million at december   which represented and  respectively  of total gross accounts receivable 
during  we recognized expense of million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off million of uncollectible accounts  which reduced the reserve 
during  we made no increases for doubtful accounts and wrote off million of uncollectible accounts  which reduced the reserve 
inventories at december   we had net inventory of million 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost last in  first out lifo  first in  first out fifo and average cost methods or market  less progress payments 
costs include direct material  direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead  and other direct costs 
most of our inventory is valued utilizing the lifo costing methodology 
inventory of our non us operations is valued using average cost or fifo methods 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle 
the prices for many of the raw materials we use have been extremely volatile  especially during and when certain raw material prices rose rapidly  compared to the previous year 
since we value most of our inventory utilizing the lifo inventory costing methodology  a rapid rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results 
for example in and in  the effect of the increase in raw material costs on our lifo inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was million and million higher  respectively  than would have been recognized if we utilized the fifo methodology to value our inventory 
in a period of rising prices  
table of contents cost of sales expense recognized under lifo is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold 
conversely  in a period of declining raw material prices  cost of sales recognized under lifo is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold 
we evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value 
the calculation of a resulting reserve  if any  is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified 
at december   no such reserves were required 
it is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months 
in some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products 
asset impairment we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets 
an impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an asset s use including any proceeds from disposition are less than the asset s carrying value  and the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group  and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment  are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment 
future cash flow value may include appraisals for property  plant and equipment  land and improvements  future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets  and other operating considerations 
at december   we had million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
changes in the goodwill balance from are due to foreign currency translation 
of the total  million related to the flat rolled products segment  million related to the high performance metals segment  and million related to the engineered products segment 
goodwill is required to be reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this comparison reflects impairment  then the loss would be measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities 
we perform our annual evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment during the fourth quarter 
our evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each of the reporting units that have goodwill associated with their operations using discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques  plus valuation comparisons to recent public sale transactions of similar businesses  if any 
these valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results  cash flows including changes in working capital and capital expenditures  selling prices  profitability  and the cost of capital 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions used were reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
no goodwill impairment was determined to exist for the years ended december   or income taxes deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes  or differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases 
deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits assets or costs liabilities to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether  based on all available evidence  we believe that our deferred income tax assets will be realizable 
valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is probable more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the evaluation  as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  includes the consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  regarding historical operating results including recent years with reported losses  the estimated timing of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  and potential tax planning strategies which may be employed to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused 
future realization of deferred income tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback  carryforward period available under tax law 
the recognition  or reversal  of a valuation allowance is recorded as a non cash charge or benefit to the income tax provision with an offsetting adjustment against the deferred income tax asset 
contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired  we recognize a loss if the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants  and disposal of wastes  and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or 
table of contents disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations 
we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites 
with respect to proceedings brought under the federal superfund laws  or similar state statutes  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at approximately of such sites  excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability 
our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately of these sites  and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining individual sites is not considered to be material 
we are a party to various cost sharing arrangements with other prps at the sites 
the terms of the cost sharing arrangements are subject to non disclosure agreements as confidential information 
nevertheless  the cost sharing arrangements generally require all prps to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site related costs 
in addition  the federal government  through various agencies  is a party to several such arrangements 
environmental liabilities are recorded when our liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable 
in many cases  we are not able to determine whether we are liable or  if liability is probable  to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss 
estimates of our liability are further subject to additional uncertainties including the nature and extent of site contamination  available remediation alternatives  the extent of corrective actions that may be required  and the participation  number and financial condition of other prps 
we intend to adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate 
future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments 
at december   our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately million 
accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not take into account the effects of inflation  and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the accruals are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect allocations among prps at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites after an assessment is made of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites and after appropriate cost sharing or other agreements are entered 
our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts  present laws and regulations  and current technology 
such estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation  the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities  and the professional judgment of our environmental experts in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the matters with which we are currently associated either individually or in the aggregate will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters  however  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
retirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of our employees 
in the fourth quarter and in third quarter  we made voluntary cash contributions of million and million  respectively  to our us defined benefit pension plan to improve the plan s funded position 
we are not required to make a contribution to the us defined benefit pension plan for  and  based upon current regulations and actuarial analyses  we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to the us defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years 
however  we may elect  depending upon the investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors  to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis  rather than as contributions are made to the plan 
a significant element in determining our pension expense income in accordance with sfas is the expected investment return on plan assets 
in establishing the expected return on plan investments  which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter  we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan investments are invested in  how those investments have performed historically  and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future 
for  in light of the declines in the equity markets in through  which comprise a significant portion of our pension plan investments  we lowered our expected return on pension plan investments to  from a expected return on pension plan investments which was used in we apply this assumed rate to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension expense income for the current year 
the actual return on pension plan assets was for  for  and for while the actual return on pension plan investments has exceeded the expected return on pension plan 
table of contents investments for each of the past three years  our expected return on pension plan investments for remains at 
the effect of increasing  or lowering  the expected return on pension plan investments by results in additional annual income  or expense  of approximately million 
the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods 
the amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year 
us generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years  which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense  or their fair market value at the end of the previous year 
however  the securities and exchange commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology  which is the methodology that we use  to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology 
as a result  our results of operations and those of other companies  including companies with which we compete  may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments 
if we had used the five year average of the fair market values of plan assets to calculate retirement benefit costs  we estimate that retirement benefit expense for would have been approximately million less than the million expense recognized using the fair market value approach 
at the end of november of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to value pension plan liabilities 
in accordance with sfas  the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments 
based on this assessment at the end of november  we established a discount rate of for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of  and for determining the pension expense for we had previously assumed a discount rate of for  which determined the expense  and for  which determined the expense 
the effect of lowering the discount rate to increased pension liabilities by approximately million at year end  and is expected to increase pension expense by approximately million in the effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with sfas accounting standards require a minimum pension liability be recorded when the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo at the annual measurement date 
as of november   our measurement date for pension accounting  the value of the accumulated pension benefit obligation abo exceeded the value of pension investments by approximately million 
in the fourth quarter  as a result of a severe decline in the equity markets in through  higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in  and a lower assumed discount rate for valuing the pension liabilities  we recorded a non cash charge against stockholders equity of million  net of deferred taxes  to write off our prepaid pension cost representing the previous overfunded portion of the pension plan  and to record a deferred pension asset of million for the unamortized prior service cost relating to prior benefit enhancements 
in the fourth quarter of  and  our adjustments of the minimum pension liability resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of million for  and increases to stockholders equity of million for and million for these minimum pension liability adjustments are presented as other comprehensive income loss 
the recognition of the minimum pension liability in  and the adjustments of the minimum pension liability in  and do not affect our reported results of operations and do not have a cash impact 
in accordance with accounting standards  the charge against stockholders equity will be adjusted in the fourth quarter of subsequent years to reflect the value of pension assets compared to the abo as of the end of november 
if the level of pension assets exceeds the abo as of a future measurement date  the full charge against stockholders equity would be reversed 
in the first quarter  the financial accounting standards board fasb announced that they were considering changes to accounting for retirement benefits 
one of the proposals being considered by the fasb would require companies to recognize the minimum pension liability using the projected benefit obligation pbo rather than the abo  the difference being that the pbo includes estimates for future salary increases 
the effect of this proposal  if adopted as described  is not expected to have a material effect on the company s stockholders equity  and would have no effect on reported retirement benefit expense 
we also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees 
these plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees 
under most of the plans  our contributions towards premiums are capped based upon the cost as of a certain date  thereby creating a defined contribution 
for the non collectively bargained plans  we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future 
we account for these benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis  rather than as benefits are paid 
we use actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs  to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for the plans 
the discount rate  which is determined annually at the end of november of each year  is developed based upon rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
at the end of 
table of contents  we determined this rate to be  a reduction from a discount rate in and in the effect of lowering the discount rate to from increased postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately million  and expenses are expected to increase by approximately million 
based upon predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years  the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits for health care plans is for and is assumed to gradually decrease to in the year and remain level thereafter 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act medicare act  was signed into law on december  the medicare act provides for a federal subsidy  with tax free payments commencing in  to sponsors of retiree health care benefits plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the law 
the federal subsidy included in the law resulted in a reduction of our other postretirement benefits obligation of approximately million  and a corresponding reduction in our postretirement benefit expense of approximately million 
this reduction in the other postretirement benefits obligation is recognized in the financial statements over a number of years as an actuarial experience gain 
certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a veba trust 
the expected return on plan investments is a significant element in determining postretirement benefits expenses in accordance with sfas in establishing the expected return on plan investments  which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter  we take into consideration the types of securities the plan investments are invested in  how those investments have performed historically  and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future 
for  our expected return on investments held in the veba trust was 
this assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan investments at the end of the previous year 
this produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year 
while the actual return on investments held in the veba trust was in both and  and for  our expected return on investments in the veba trust remains for the expected return on investments held in the veba trust is expected to exceed the return on pension plan investments due to a higher percentage of private equity investments held by the veba trust 
new accounting pronouncements in the fourth quarter  we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated  even if conditional on a future event 
for existing asset retirement obligations which are determined to be recognizable under fin  the effect of applying fin is recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
our adoption of fin resulted in recognizing a charge of million  net of income taxes  or per share  principally for estimable asset retirement obligations related to remediation costs which would be incurred if we were to cease certain manufacturing activities which utilize what may be categorized as potentially hazardous materials 
in the first quarter  we adopted fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this revised standard  companies may no longer account for share based compensation transactions  such as stock options  restricted stock  and potential payments under programs such as our total shareholder return program tsrp awards  using the intrinsic value method as defined in apb opinion no 
instead  companies are required to account for such equity transactions using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied 
however  compensation expense already recognized is not adjusted if market conditions are not met  such as our total shareholder return performance relative to a peer group under our tsrp awards  or for stock options expiring out of the money 
we adopted the new standard using the modified prospective method  in which the effect of the standard is recognized in the period of adoption and in future periods 
prior periods are not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard at earlier dates 
in  the fasb issued sfas under sfas  obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets  such as landfill and other facility closure costs  are capitalized and amortized to expense over an asset s useful life using a systematic and rational allocation method 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas on january  resulted in a charge of million  net of tax  or per share  which was recognized in our first quarter statement of operations as a cumulative change in accounting principle  primarily for asset retirement obligations related to landfills

we assume no duty to update our forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible 
at december   we had approximately million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
since the interest rate on this debt floats with the short term market rate of interest  we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase 
for example  a hypothetical in rate of interest on million of outstanding floating rate debt would result in increased annual financing costs of million 
approximately million of this floating rate debt is capped at a maximum interest rate 
volatility of energy prices 
energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources 
the prices for and availability of electricity  natural gas  oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control 
increases in energy costs  or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors  have and may continue to adversely affect our profitability 
to the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive  increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we use approximately to million mmbtu s of natural gas annually  depending upon business conditions  in the manufacture of our products 
these purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices 
for example  a hypothetical per mmbtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately to million 
volatility of raw material prices 
we use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs  however  competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms  and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms 
for example  since we generally use in excess of million pounds of nickel each year  a hypothetical change of per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately million 
in addition  we also use in excess of million pounds of ferrous scrap in the production of our products and a hypothetical change of per pound would result in increased costs of approximately million 
while we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations  such as for nickel  we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure 
we believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts  but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials
