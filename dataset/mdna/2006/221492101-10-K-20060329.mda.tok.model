overview we operate mid sized warehouse club style stores in the united states territories  foreign island countries in the pacific and the caribbean  the hawaiian islands and sonora  california 
our primary strategy is to operate in island markets  offering predominately us branded goods 
we currently operate eleven retail stores as follows two stores in each of hawaii and guam  and one store in each of st 
thomas  st 
croix  american samoa  fiji  curacao  st 
maarten and sonora  california 
our stores are patterned after the warehouse club concept  although our stores are smaller averaging approximately  square feet vs 
large format warehouse clubs of approximately  square feet  generally target niche markets  mainly us territories  us island states and foreign island countries  where demographics do not support large format warehouse clubs  carry a wide assortment of local and ethnic food items  and do not charge a membership fee 
although we do not have large seasonal fluctuations in sales  the fourth quarter is typically the highest sales quarter due to additional holiday sales 
during fiscal  we built a new st 
croix store on a parcel of land located closer to the main trade area in the center of the island than our existing store 
this new building expanded the size of our st 
croix store by about to approximately  square feet 
the new store opened on may  until it opened  we operated in our former location under a short term lease with our former landlord 
on december   our two stores on the island of guam suffered damage from supertyphoon pongsona  resulting in the immediate closure of both stores 
our tamuning store lost its generator in the storm  but reopened shortly thereafter on december  our dededo store  however  suffered more significant damage  and had to be closed for reconstruction 
the store was rebuilt and it reopened for business on october  during fiscal we experienced a increase in comparable store sales as adjusted to reflect a week year as compared to a increase in fiscal the increase in comparable store sales for fiscal was due to several factors including general inflationary trends and ongoing merchandising initiatives 
increasing energy prices have impacted our cost of doing business in the form of higher freight charges and store utility costs  however operating margins were maintained due to improved merchandising and reduced expenses in other areas 
store economics we generally report our results based on a week year  however  fiscal was a week year 
the following store economic information has been adjusted for comparability to a week year  by excluding the rd week the last week of december from the same store sales calculations in order to provide a normalized comparison against the corresponding fiscal periods in during fiscal  on a week year basis  our eleven stores generated annual average net sales of approximately million  average net sales per square foot of approximately  average annual per store contribution of approximately million  and average annual per store contribution before depreciation of approximately million 
store contribution is store gross profit less direct store operating expenses 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain consolidated income statement data 
fiscal year ended january  december  december  net sales gross margin operating expenses store general and administrative store opening store closing operating income interest expense  net other income expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal was a week year  all other fiscal years were week years 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for the weeks in fiscal were million  an increase of  as compared to net sales of million for the weeks in fiscal approximately of the increase was due to the benefit of an additional week of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the balance of the increase was due to comparable store sales increases offset by a decline in business to business sales as compared to fiscal we expect the level of business to business activity for fiscal to be similar or slightly less than the levels in comparable store sales stores open for a full months increased during fiscal as adjusted to reflect a week year as compared to fiscal all but one of our stores experienced increased sales as compared to the prior year  primarily due to general inflationary trends  improvements in our assortment of goods and operating improvements including better in stock inventory levels 
gross margin 
gross margin improved to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales resulted primarily from a stronger mix of retail store sales  with typically higher margins  as compared to business to business sales  which generally provide a lower gross margin but are executed at minimal direct expense 
store expenses 
store expenses increased to million  or of sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal approximately of the dollar increase in store expenses was attributable to increased payroll and related costs attributable to the higher volume of sales in fiscal as a percent of store sales  payroll and related costs were of store sales in both fiscal and fiscal increased energy utility expenses  which were higher than the same period in the prior year  accounted for an additional of the dollar increase in store expenses 
we expect energy costs to continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
the remainder of the dollar increase was primarily attributable to an increase of in bankcard fees primarily attributable to higher sales volume  an increase in commercial insurance expense  and increases in depreciation and advertising in fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to lower compensation costs largely resulting from decreased performance based awards pursuant to our incentive bonus program as compared to the same awards in the prior year 
store opening expense 
store opening expenses were million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase in store opening expenses in fiscal primarily related to costs associated with the relocation of our st 
croix store  which opened on may  expenses for both years include costs associated with the evaluation of potential new store locations 
store closing expenses store closing expenses of million in fiscal are due to the costs incurred with closing our former st 
croix location after we relocated our store on may  net interest expense 
interest expense  net  remained flat at million for both fiscal and fiscal  as increased interest costs associated with rising interest rates in fiscal were offset by the capitalization of approximately  in interest related to the construction of our st 
croix store  as compared to  capitalized in the prior year 
other income expense other income expense declined to  for fiscal  as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in fiscal as compared to the prior year  was primarily due to losses exceeding gains on foreign currency transactions and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in foreign countries in fiscal  partially offset by the receipt of a  non recurring insurance reimbursement 
the income and losses on foreign currency in both fiscal years was primarily attributable to appreciation depreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision in fiscal of million  or of pre tax income 
the tax provision primarily represents taxes associated with income generated in the us and us territories 
additionally  during fiscal  due to certain tax planning strategies  we were able to offset a portion of our foreign subsidiary losses against foreign subsidiary income  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate as compared to prior years 
as of january   we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million  some of which  if not utilized  will begin expiring in the year the nols include approximately million related to curacao and st 
maarten which are not subject to expiration time limits 
our ability to utilize the nols is dependent upon generating taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million attributable to the million of tax benefits recorded for net operating loss carryforwards 
net income 
our net income was million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal of million increased  as compared to net sales of million for the comparable period in the prior year 
approximately of the increase was due to the reopening of our store in dededo  guam in october the balance of the increase was due to comparable store sales increases offset by a decline in business to business sales as compared to fiscal comparable store sales stores open for a full months increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal comparable store sales are calculated on stores excluding the guam market as our dededo  guam store was closed during the corresponding periods in the prior year and during those periods our tamuning  guam store benefited from the temporary closure of our dededo store 
all of our other stores experienced increased sales as compared to the prior year  primarily due to improvements in our assortment of food and general merchandise  operating improvements including better in stock inventory levels and improved economic conditions in some of our markets 
gross margin 
gross margin improved to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales resulted primarily from better sourcing  pricing and merchandising of goods in our stores and a stronger mix of retail store sales  with typically higher margins  as compared to business to business sales  which generally provide a lower gross margin but are executed at minimal direct expense 
store expenses 
store expenses increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  but remained flat as a percent of sales at of sales for both fiscal and fiscal approximately of the dollar increase in store expenses was attributable to increased expenses associated with operating eleven stores during all of fiscal as compared to ten stores for ten of the twelve months in fiscal the remainder of the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a increase in commercial insurance expense  a increase in energy utility expense and a increase in rent expense  accelerated depreciation related to the planned relocation of our st 
croix store  and higher volume related expenses such as payroll and bankcard fees 
as a percent of store sales  payroll and related costs declined in to as compared to of store sales in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a increase in compensation costs largely resulting from increased performance based awards pursuant to our incentive bonus program 
additionally  we had a increase in commercial insurance costs  partially offset by non recurring costs incurred in in connection with a million write down of idle fixed assets from previously closed stores and the acceleration of depreciation of leasehold improvements related to our corporate office move  as well as fiscal transaction costs incurred in connection with our discussions with assi  inc regarding a potential strategic business combination that did not occur 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased to in fiscal  as compared to in the corresponding period in the prior year  primarily due to the leveraging of corporate expenses over increased store sales 
store opening expense 
store opening expenses were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal store opening expense in fiscal related to costs associated with the evaluation of potential new store locations and current store relocations 
store opening expenses in fiscal primarily related to the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
net interest expense 
interest expense  net  decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  as borrowings on our line of credit decreased compared to the prior year 
other income expense other income of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to gains on foreign currency transactions and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceeded the permanent investments in those countries 
other income of million in fiscal included a gain of million related to the receipt of insurance reimbursements for damage to inventory and equipment sustained from the supertyphoon in guam and gains of million on foreign currency transactions and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceeded the permanent investments in those countries 
the income on foreign currency in both fiscal years was primarily attributable to appreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision in fiscal of million  or of pre tax income 
the tax provision represents taxes associated with income generated in the us and us territories 
no taxes or tax benefits were provided on foreign pre tax losses in fiscal  as we cannot predict whether we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
as of december   we had foreign nols of approximately million  some of which  if not utilized  begin expiring in the year the nols include approximately million related to curacao and st 
maarten which are not subject to expiration time limits 
our ability to utilize the nols is dependent upon generating taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of million attributable to the million of tax benefits recorded for net operating loss carryforwards 
net income 
our net income was million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our operations with proceeds from various credit facilities and internally generated funds 
although we utilized existing working capital to finance the million used to purchase the land and construct our new st 
croix store  we hope to re finance our st 
croix store  and any future relocations and new stores  either through an operating lease  a sale leaseback arrangement or long term funding from a financial institution 
we intend to continue leasing as many of our store locations as feasible 
in those instances where a lease is not available on acceptable terms  we intend to finance our stores utilizing long term funding from a financial institution as we currently do for our st 
thomas and st 
maarten buildings 
we generated million  million and million of net cash from operations during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operations in as compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of million  partially offset by a decrease in cash used for inventory purchases of million 
the increase in net cash provided by operations in as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in net income of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash used in investing activities during fiscal  was primarily due to costs associated with the construction of the new building in st 
croix where we relocated our st 
croix store on may  the cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to the purchase of land in st 
croix for approximately million and costs associated with the construction of the building on this parcel of land 
the relocated store is closer to the main trade area in the center of the island than the existing store and has now been increased in size by about to  square feet 
the cash used in investing activities in primarily related to the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
the proceeds from insurance settlements received in fiscal and relate to insurance reimbursements received on fixed assets lost in the supertyphoon in guam 
although we currently have no plans to open stores in new markets during fiscal  in july the cayman islands trade and business licensing board granted approval for us to operate a retail and wholesale business in the cayman islands through a controlled subsidiary 
this is the first in a series of steps that we must take before we can open a store operating under the cost u less name in the cayman islands 
we do not have an approximate timing as to when a new store would open in the cayman islands  if at all  but expect that it will take at least twelve to eighteen months once the permitting  governmental approval and lease process is complete 
in the meantime  we are actively working with local architects and engineers to more precisely define the type of building we could construct as a prelude to applying for construction permits 
in addition  we are currently in the process of renovating and expanding the size of our store in st 
thomas by approximately  square feet an increase of approximately 
we anticipate that the cost associated with building construction and updating equipment will be approximately to million 
additionally  we anticipate spending approximately million to remodel our kauai store in order to add retail enhancements such as fresh produce by the pound 
during fiscal  we also plan to replace our current point of sale system with a new and improved version  which we anticipate will cost approximately to million  most of which will be financed with a capital lease 
in addition to these projects  we continue to explore expansion opportunities in selected markets and additional relocation opportunities for stores in existing markets 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to million received on equipment purchased for our st 
croix store and million received from the exercise of common stock options 
net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in the balance on our line of credit and a million decrease in bank checks outstanding  partially offset by million of funds received on the sale leaseback of equipment in guam 
in fiscal  million was used to reduce the balance on our line of credit  which was offset by an increase of million in bank checks outstanding 
foreign currency translation resulted in a gain of  in fiscal and losses of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the foreign currency translation gains and losses are a result of the translation of our subsidiaries operating results and balance sheets from local currencies to u 
s 
dollars 
we have had a line of credit with wells fargo business credit since april  on may   we amended the line of credit to extend the maturity date of the facility from april   to may  additionally  the amendment reduced the interest rate to an annual interest rate equal to the prime rate  reduced the minimum interest charge to not less than  per calendar year  increased the unused line fee to a rate of three eighths of one percent per annum on the average daily unused line  and eliminated the one day interest charge on all payments received on the line of credit 
borrowings continue to be limited to the lesser of million or the amount calculated under the borrowing base 
the borrowing base is equal to the lesser of a million or b the sum of of eligible inventory in the united states of america  plus of eligible inventory in the us virgin islands and guam  less specified reserves 
the line of credit consists of a million committed  secured revolving credit line with a sublimit for letters of credit and bankers acceptances in an amount up to million 
at january   there was million outstanding on the line of credit and million in letters of credit outstanding 
borrowings under the amended line of credit were charged interest at wells fargo s prime rate plus from the beginning of the most recent fiscal year through may   and at the prime rate from may   through january  at january   the rate charged by wells fargo was 
the line of credit contains various covenants  including a requirement that we maintain minimum pre tax income and tangible net worth  as well as limitations on acquisitions  additional debt  changes in control and capital expenditures 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
a significant portion of our cash flow is generated by our operations 
if our operating results deteriorate as a result of a decrease in customer demand  declining economic conditions in the markets in which we have stores  or pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
we believe that amounts available under our various credit facilities  existing cash available for working capital purposes  and cash flow from operations will most likely be sufficient to fund our operations through the next twelve months 
however  if such sources of liquidity are unavailable or insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to issue equity or debt securities  obtain additional credit facilities or consider alternative financing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed  or that any available financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations as of january   our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years long term debt operating leases capital leases total critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of actual physical inventory count results 
long lived assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets  including intangibles  may be impaired  we perform an evaluation of the recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future cash flows 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss by a charge against current operations 
foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for all our locations  except for fiji and netherlands antilles  where the local currency is the functional currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the applicable exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
net sales costs and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
adjustments resulting from this process are reported  net of taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
the cumulative translation adjustment resulting from a net investment in a country is recognized as income or expense in the period we substantially liquidate operations in that country 
income taxes income tax expense includes us and foreign income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we apply judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  and valuation allowances are established when necessary 
our effective tax rate is currently higher than the expected federal statutory rate because valuation allowances have been established against the tax benefits of foreign losses  as we have no assurance that we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
we are developing and implementing certain tax planning strategies  which may affect our ability to recognize some of the deferred tax assets that are currently allowed for and may ultimately change our estimate of the valuation allowance in future periods 
accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement revised  share based payment fas r 
fas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
fas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
fas r replaces fas and supersedes apb as originally issued in  fas established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb  as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
we are required to apply fas r as of the beginning of fiscal we expect to use the modified prospective method effective with our first quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of this new accounting standard will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position  as we have a limited amount of unvested options and options available for issuance in the future 
on november   the fasb issued statement no 
fas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
fas requires that abnormal items be recognized as current period charges  as well as unallocated overheads recognized in the period in which they are incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after june  our adoption of fas in our first quarter of fiscal is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate stores in foreign countries and have market risks associated with foreign currencies 
however  sales are primarily made in us dollars or foreign currencies with minimal trade credit extended and no borrowings exist in foreign currencies 
cash deposited from sales are remitted back to the us bank account routinely 
we record gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in those countries in other income expense 
gains and losses are primarily attributable to appreciation and depreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
we operate in three foreign countries that function under currencies other than the us dollar 
two of the these foreign countries operate under the netherlands antilles guilder that has historically had an exchange rate fixed to the us dollar but there can be no assurance that this will continue 
if the netherlands antilles guilder is allowed to float this would lead to an increase in foreign exchange volatility and risk which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
there is also the possibility these three foreign countries that function under currencies other than the us dollar could devalue their currency against the us dollar at any time and if this was to occur there could be a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have also assessed our vulnerability to interest rate risk associated with our financial instruments  including  cash and cash equivalents  lines of credit and long term debt 
due to the nature of these financial instruments  we believe that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations does not pose a material risk 
our line of credit and long term debt can be expected to vary in the future as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments as of january
