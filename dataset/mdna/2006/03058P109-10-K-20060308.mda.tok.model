in addition  support activities have been centralized to enable the production groups to focus on sales  improve compliance and enhance efficiencies 
expanding the markets served through de novo branching and acquisitions 
americanwest bank intends to expand its presence in the pacific northwest by opening new branches and acquiring other financial institutions 
management considers a variety of criteria in evaluating potential branch expansion  including the demographics and short and long term growth prospects for the location  the management and other resources needed to integrate the branch into the bank s existing operations  the degree to which the branch would enhance the geographic diversity of the bank or would enhance the presence in an existing market  and the estimated cost of opening and operating the branch as compared to the cost of acquiring an existing office and deposit base 
in addition to internal growth  there may be attractive opportunities to grow americanwest bank through carefully selected acquisitions of other financial institutions or their branches within or adjacent to the bank s market area 
recent events 
americanwest bank has recently received regulatory approval for de novo branches in coeur d alene and sandpoint  idaho which are scheduled to open in the first quarter of americanwest bank has also recently received regulatory approval to acquire columbia trust bank in pasco  washington 
columbia trust bank ctb had total assets of million and total deposits of million as of september  ctb has branches located in pasco  kennewick  sunnyside and yakima  washington through which it provides commercial banking services 
the transaction is valued at million and consideration will be paid in shares and cash 
the value of each americanwest bancorporation common stock share to be issued in the merger will depend on the average trading price during a defined day trading period 
the price per columbia trust bancorp share is 
americanwest bank s management projects up to million in transaction expenses  including an estimated market loss on the sale of three of its existing branches as some operations will be consolidated into the ctb branches 
projected cost savings as a result of the transaction are close to which is above million 
exclusive of any revenue enhancement which may occur  the projected accretion during the first full year of combined operations is per share or  excluding transaction expenses 
on february  the ctb shareholders approved of the merger and the merger is expected to close before the end of the first quarter of americanwest bank s ability to make future acquisitions depends on several factors such as the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  necessary regulatory and shareholder approval  compliance with applicable capital requirements and  in the case of cash acquisitions  on its cash assets or ability to acquire cash 
awb may need to obtain additional debt and or equity capital in pursuing an acquisition strategy 
its access to capital markets or the costs of this capital could be impacted by economic  financial  competitive and other conditions beyond its control 
further  acquisition candidates may not be available in the future on favorable terms 
therefore  no assurance can be made that additional acquisitions will occur 
products and services americanwest bank s products and services consist mainly of gathering deposits and providing loans to enable its customers to meet their financial objectives 
the bank offers a variety of accounts designed to attract both short term and long term deposits from its retail and business customers 
these accounts include negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market demand accounts mmda  savings accounts  and time deposits 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by awb management based on competitive market factors and management s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits based on anticipated future funding needs 

table of contents awb s loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans  real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans and installment and other loans 
the majority of the loans held by awb were to borrowers within the bank s principal market areas 
commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate loans primarily consist of loans to purchase  refinance  or construct commercial and multifamily properties 
these loans are secured by real estate  generally mature in five to ten years and can be fixed or adjustable rate 
commercial construction loans may involve additional risks because loan funds are collateralized by the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion 
delays may arise from labor problems  material shortages may be experienced and other unpredictable contingencies may occur 
it is important to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios 
because of these factors  the analysis of prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from the expertise required for other commercial real estate lending 
awb s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each commercial construction loan 
among other things  awb management considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing for the borrower  the reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project  the independent appraisal and review of cost estimates  the pre construction sale and leasing information  and the cash flow projections of the borrower 
commercial and industrial loans 
commercial loans primarily consist of loans to businesses for various purposes  including term loans  revolving lines of credit  equipment financing loans and letters of credit 
these loans generally mature within one to five years  have adjustable rates and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable  or equipment  although certain loans are unsecured 
commercial lending risk results from dependence on income production for future repayment  and in certain circumstances  the lack of tangible collateral 
commercial loans are underwritten based on the financial strength and repayment ability of the borrower  as well as the value of any collateral securing the loans 
commercial lending operations rely on a strong credit culture that combines prudent credit policies and individual lender accountability 
agricultural loans 
agricultural loans primarily consist of farm loans to finance operating expenses 
these loans generally mature within one year  have adjustable rates and are secured by farm real estate  equipment  crops or livestock 
since agricultural loans present certain risks not associated with other types of lending  such as weather  the policy of awb is to make such loans only to agricultural producers that carry crop insurance  thereby mitigating the risk of loss attributable to a crop failure caused by weather factors 
real estate mortgage loans 
mortgage loans include various types of loans for which real property is held as collateral 
these loans include adjustable and fixed rate first mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties  and second mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties 
mortgage loans that are held in portfolio typically mature or reprice in one to five years and require payments on amortization schedules ranging from one year to thirty years 
awb sells most of its fixed rate real estate mortgage loans that mature in fifteen to thirty years 
real estate construction loans 
construction loans are made to individuals and contractors to construct primarily single family residences 
these loans typically have maturities of one year 
interest rates are usually variable  although some fixed rate loans are made 
the bank s policies normally require that a permanent financing commitment be in place before a construction loan is made to an individual borrower 
construction loans have unique risks because loan funds are collateralized by the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion 
delays may arise from labor problems  material shortages  and other unpredictable contingencies that may occur 
it is important to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios 
because of these factors  the analysis of prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from the expertise required for real estate mortgage lending 
construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of collateral risk than long term financing of residential properties 
awb s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each real estate construction loan 
among other things  awb management 
table of contents considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing for the borrower  the reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project  the independent appraisal and review of cost estimates  the pre construction sale and leasing information  and the cash flow projections of the borrower 
installment and other loans 
installment and other loans are primarily automobile  bankcard and personal loans  otherwise known as consumer loans 
these loans generally have maturities of five years or less  and fixed interest rates 
consumer lending may involve special risks  including decreases in the value of collateral and transaction costs associated with foreclosure and repossession 
principal market area americanwest bank s branches are located in the three largest metropolitan areas in eastern and central washington spokane  yakima  and the tri cities area comprised of pasco  kennewick and richland  and in suburban and rural communities in eastern and central washington and northern idaho 
spokane  with its diversified economy of military  manufacturing  government  health care  construction  financial services  natural resources and retail services  has generally been stable and resistant to many of the national economic highs and lows 
spokane county s population grew by an estimated  people from to  or 
estimated median household income in spokane county in was  about higher than the prior year 
spokane county s unemployment rate fell from to in home sales in spokane county increased by to  in the average home sale price in the spokane market saw the highest increase in over years  climbing from  in to  in the tri cities  including benton and franklin counties  has been a fast growing area in washington state as the population grew from to and grew in to  estimated median household income as of the census was  and climbed to  in in the tri cities  average home prices grew by to  in as home sales continued to be strong with growth of from to yakima county s population grew to  from to median household income grew by an estimated over figures to  yakima s unemployment rate fell from to in after remaining at over for the prior three years 
in yakima county  average home prices rose somewhat to  for a increase  while home sales grew 
the company s expansion plans in the northern idaho market are fueled by steady and significant growth projections 
kootenai county had population growth from to  rising to  household incomes in the area climbed to  the unemployment rate fell to a ten year low of 
housing remained very strong with home sales increasing and average sale prices soaring by from  in to  in the company s branches which are located in rural towns in eastern and central washington and northern idaho are in areas with economies that historically have been based on agriculture  timber  mining  education  and tourism industries 
the company believes that these locations generally do not provide significant economic growth but tend to be underserved by the financial industry 
the above and population and income estimates for spokane and yakima counties are from the us census bureau 
the kootenai county and tri cities area information and the population and income are projections from claritas demographics 
competition the company competes primarily with large national and regional banks  as well as credit unions  savings and loans  mortgage companies  and other financial and non financial institutions 
awb management believes there are three key differentiators that distinguish it from its bank competition it is committed to a local  
table of contents community banking model  its smaller size makes it more adaptable  and it puts customer service first 
management also believes that its competitive position has been strengthened by the consolidation of past years in the banking industry  which resulted in many community banks that were previously owned locally becoming part of large national or regional banks 
the bank s strategy  by contrast  is to remain closely tied to a community banking model with strong local connections 
employees as of december   the company had full time equivalent employees no employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
following the mergers and consolidations in the early part of this decade and in its current pending merger with columbia trust bank  awb management has focused on acculturating employees while acknowledging and respecting the heritage of each bank and how it has shaped who the company is today 
all employees now operate under a unified organization  which management believes has been a positive transition 
renewed focus on employee training programs  on internal marketing and communication systems  and on consistent and equitable salary structures will further improve employee relations  which management believes are currently good

the operations of awbc may also be affected by changes in the policies of banking and other government regulators 
awbc cannot accurately predict the nature or extent of the effects on its business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies  or new federal or state laws  may have in the future 
changes in banking laws and regulations 
on november   the president signed into law the financial services modernization act of generally  the act repeals the historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating with securities firms  provides a uniform framework for the activities of banks  savings institutions and their holding companies  broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies  provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumers information and addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day to day operations and long term activities of financial institutions 
bank holding companies are permitted to engage in a wider variety of financial activities than permitted under previous law  particularly with respect to insurance and securities activities 
in addition  in a change from previous law  bank holding companies will be in a position to be owned  controlled or acquired by any company engaged in financially related activities  so long as such company meets certain regulatory requirements 
the act also permits national banks and  in states with wildcard statutes  certain state banks  either directly or through operating subsidiaries  to engage in certain nonbanking financial activities 
awbc does not believe that the act negatively affects the operations of it or its subsidiaries 
however  to the extent the legislation permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
this consolidation could result in a growing number of larger financial institutions that offer a wider variety of financial services than awbc currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the markets currently served by awbc

regulation of management 
federal law sets forth the circumstances under which officers or directors of a financial institution may be removed by the institution s federal supervisory agency  places restraints on lending by an institution to its executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and their related interests  and prohibits management personnel from serving as a director or in other management positions with another financial institution that has assets exceeding a specified amount or that has an office within a specified geographic area 
tie in arrangements 
awbc cannot engage in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  awbc may not condition an extension of credit on either a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by it or an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor 
state law restrictions 
as a washington business corporation  awbc may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions as provided under applicable washington corporate law 
in addition  washington banking law may restrict certain activities of the company

the federal and state laws that apply to awbc s subsidiary bank regulate  among other things  the scope of its business  its investments  its reserves against deposits  the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for loans 
the laws and regulations governing its subsidiary bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and not to protect stockholders of the subsidiary bank or its holding company 

table of contents community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act requires that  in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction  regulators must evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
insider credit transactions 
banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons 
extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons 
a violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer  director  employee  agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank  the imposition of a cease and desist order and other regulatory sanctions 
federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  each federal banking agency has prescribed  by regulation  non capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
these standards cover internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate  and standards for asset quality  earnings and stock valuation 
an institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management of awbc believes that its subsidiary bank meets all such standards and  therefore  does not believe that these regulatory standards materially affect awbc s business operations 
deposit insurance 
the deposits of awb are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through the bank insurance fund bif administered by the fdic 
all insured banks are required to pay semi annual deposit insurance premium assessments to the fdic 
fdicia included provisions to reform the federal deposit insurance system  including the implementation of risk based deposit insurance premiums 
fdicia also permits the fdic to make special assessments on insured depository institutions in amounts determined by the fdic to be necessary to give it adequate assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the us treasury and other sources  or for any other purpose the fdic deems necessary 
the fdic has implemented a risk based insurance premium system under which banks are assessed insurance premiums based on how much risk they present to the bif 
banks with higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of interstate act permits nationwide interstate banking and branching under certain circumstances 
this legislation generally authorizes interstate branching and relaxes federal law restrictions on interstate banking 
currently  bank holding companies may purchase banks in any state  and states may not prohibit such purchases 
additionally  banks are permitted to merge with banks in other states as long as the home state of neither merging bank has opted out 
the interstate act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low income area 
under recent fdic regulations  banks are prohibited from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production 
the fdic has accordingly implemented a loan to deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition 
with regard to interstate bank mergers  washington has opted in to the interstate act and allows in state banks to merge with out of state banks subject to certain aging requirements 
washington law generally 
table of contents authorizes the acquisition of an in state bank by an out of state bank through merger with a washington financial institution that has been in existence for at least five years prior to the acquisition 
with regard to interstate bank branching  out of state banks that do not already operate a branch in washington may not establish de novo branches in washington or establish and operate a branch by acquiring a branch in washington 
privacy

management believes the company is currently in compliance with the privacy rules 
dividends 
the principal source of the parent company s cash revenues is dividends received from its subsidiary bank 
the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation  in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements 
capital adequacy 
federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of banks and bank holding companies 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  the bank or bank holding company may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses or to open new facilities 
the fdic and federal reserve use risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
these are designed to make such capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines are minimums  and the federal reserve has noted that bank holding companies contemplating significant expansion programs should not allow expansion to diminish their capital ratios and should maintain ratios well in excess of the minimum 
the current guidelines require all bank holding companies and federally regulated banks to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio equal to  of which at least must be tier i capital 
tier i capital for bank holding companies includes common shareholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less intangible assets 
the company s regulatory capital ratios are reported in note regulatory matters 
the federal reserve also employs a leverage ratio  which is tier i capital as a percentage of total average assets less intangibles  to be used as a supplement to risk based guidelines 
the principal objective of the leverage ratio is to constrain the maximum degree to which a bank holding company may leverage its equity capital base 
the federal reserve requires a minimum leverage ratio of 
however  for all but the most highly rated bank holding companies and for bank holding companies seeking to expand  the federal reserve expects an additional amount of capital of at least to fdicia created a statutory framework of supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of the individual institution 
under regulations adopted by the fdic  an institution is assigned to one of five capital categories depending on its total risk based capital ratio  tier i risk based capital ratio  and leverage ratio  together with certain subjective factors 
institutions which are deemed to be undercapitalized depending on the category to which they are assigned are subject to certain mandatory supervisory corrective actions 
awbc does not believe that these regulations have any material effect on its operations 

table of contents effects of government monetary policy 
the earnings and growth of awbc are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve can and does implement national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession  but its open market operations in us government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the federal reserve  and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits  influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on awbc and its subsidiary bank cannot be predicted with certainty 
sarbanes oxley disclosure controls and procedures 
the sarbanes oxley act of and related rulemaking by the securities and exchange commission sec  which effect sweeping corporate disclosure and financial reporting reform generally require public companies to focus on their disclosure controls and procedures 
as a result  public companies such as americanwest bancorporation now must have disclosure controls and procedures in place and make certain disclosures about them in their periodic sec reports ie  forms k and q and their chief executive and chief financial officers must certify in these filings that they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and disclose their conclusions about the effectiveness of such controls and procedures based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by the relevant report  among other things 
awbc is monitoring the status of other related ongoing rulemaking by the sec and other regulatory entities 
currently  management believes that awbc is in compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act 
the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act  designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain anonymous access to the us financial system  has significant implications for depository institutions  broker dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money 
the usa patriot act  together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies  required financial institutions  including americanwest bank  to implement additional or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to  among other things  anti money laundering compliance  suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers 
they also permit information sharing for counter terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions  as well as among financial institutions  subject to certain conditions  and require the frb  and other federal banking agencies  to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering applications filed under section of the bhca or the bank merger act 
management believes that awbc and its subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all effective requirements prescribed by the usa patriot act 
item a 
risk factors americanwest bank faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services  which could negatively affect business 
awb is facing strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services  which could negatively affect business 
awb conducts its banking operations primarily in central and eastern washington and northern idaho 
increased competition in that market may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  awb may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the same banking services that awb offers 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
awb also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including without limitation  savings and loan institutions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  awb s competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and atms and conduct extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs 
table of contents of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain deposits  and range and quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
awb also faces competition from out of state financial intermediaries that have opened low end production offices or that solicit deposits in the market areas 
if awb is unable to attract and retain banking customers  awb may be unable to continue to grow the loan and deposit portfolios and the results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected 
changes in economic conditions  in particular an economic slowdown in washington or idaho  could materially and negatively affect business 
awbc s business is directly impacted by factors such as economic  political and market conditions  broad trends in industry and finance  legislative and regulatory changes  and changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
a deterioration in economic conditions  whether caused by national or local concerns  in particular an economic slowdown in washington or idaho  could result in the following consequences  any of which could hurt the business materially loan delinquencies may increase  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for products and services may decrease  low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease  and collateral for loans  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans 
the states of washington and idaho and certain local governments in the market area presently face fiscal challenges of which the long term impact on their economies cannot be predicted 
a downturn in the real estate market could negatively affect business 
a significant downturn in the real estate market  especially in those markets served by awbc  could negatively affect business because a significant portion  approximately as of december   of the existing loans are secured by real estate 
substantially all of the real property collateral is located in central and eastern washington and northern idaho 
real estate values could be affected by  among other things  an economic slowdown  an increase in interest rates  or drought and other natural disasters particular to washington and idaho 
awbc s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and the company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
awbc is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect prospects 
awbc is currently dependent heavily on the services of the president and chief executive officer  robert m 
daugherty  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
daugherty s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 
awbc s success also depends in part on the ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is strong in the banking industry and the company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel required 
awbc is subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect business 
because the banking business is highly regulated  the laws  rules and regulations applicable to the company are subject to regular modification and change 
there are currently proposed laws  rules and regulations that  if adopted  would materially impact operations 
there can be no assurance that these proposed laws  rules and regulations  or any other laws  rules or regulations  will not be adopted in the future  which could make compliance much more difficult or expensive  restrict the ability to originate  broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits  further limit or restrict the amount of commissions  interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold  or otherwise adversely affect business or prospects for business 
awbc is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which title is acquired 
in the ordinary course of business  awbc may own or foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
awbc may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or 
table of contents clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  awbc may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if awbc ever becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities  the financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
only a limited trading market exists for awbc s common stock which could lead to price volatility 
awbc s common stock was designated for quotation on the nasdaq national market in may  under its predecessor s name  united security bancorporation  and trading volumes since that time have been modest 
the holding company s name was changed in to americanwest bancorporation 
the limited trading market for the common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of the common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of the common stock 
in addition  even if a more active market in awbc s common stock develops  awbc cannot assure that such a market will continue or that shareholders will be able to sell their shares 
awb s allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  awb maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance and a reserve for unfunded loan commitments  which when combined is referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses  and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect operating results 
awb s allowance for credit losses is based on prior experience  as well as on an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the bank s control  and these losses may exceed current estimates 
federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review the loans and allowance for credit losses 
while the bank s management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover current losses  awb cannot assure that the allowance for credit losses will not be increased further or that regulators will not require an increase in this allowance 
either of these occurrences could materially adversely affect earnings 
americanwest bank may be unable to integrate the proposed combined operations with columbia trust bank successfully and its business and earnings may be negatively affected as a result 
the merger involves the integration of companies that have previously operated independently 
successful integration will depend primarily on awb s ability to consolidate operations  systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs 
no assurance can be given that awb will be able to integrate its post merger operations without encountering difficulties including  without limitation the loss of key employees and customers  the disruption of its respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies 
estimated cost savings are projected to come from various areas that awb s management has identified through the due diligence and integration planning process 
the elimination of duplicate tasks is projected to result in annual cost savings 
if awb has difficulties with the integration  it might not fully achieve the economic benefits it expects to result from the merger 
in addition  awb may experience greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to the integration of the business of ctb  or may not realize expected cost savings from the merger within the expected time frame 
finally  shares of awbc common stock eligible for future sale  including those that may be issued in the acquisition of columbia trust bancorp and any other offering of awbc common stock for cash  could have a dilutive effect on the market for awbc common stock and could adversely affect its market price

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the reader should read the following discussion together with awbc s consolidated financial statements  related notes and supplementary data of awbc and its subsidiaries  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect plans  estimates and beliefs 
the actual results of awbc could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
awbc is a bank holding company with a single banking subsidiary  awb 
the majority of financial activity occurs as a result of activities of awb 
unless otherwise indicated  reference to awbc shall include its fully owned subsidiary awb 
awbc s management believes that the operation of awbc  based on its mission and core values  provides a competitive advantage through a commitment to helping individuals in eastern and central washington and northern idaho meet their financial goals through a relationship banking approach that includes community involvement 
the company s commitment to community banking extends to the consistent  quality service experience the company s customers benefit from every day 
the company s service goes beyond being friendly 
many organizations talk about providing good service  but what makes awb different is a promise to provide competitive solutions  not always based on being the best price in town  but offering tangible value with solutions that work for its customers 
the company s service is responsive and reliable  personal and honest  relaxed and confident  insightful and intuitive 
awbc derives income primarily from the difference between the interest income it earns on loans and investments and the interest expense it pays on customers deposits and the company s borrowings  commonly known as net interest income 
this is supplemented by noninterest income the company earns 
primarily  the noninterest income is derived from service fees related to deposits and services provided by awbc  broker fees earned through mortgage banking activities  increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of assets 
net interest income is offset by provision for loan losses related to risks and charges associated with its loan portfolio and by operating expenses  including salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  state business and occupation taxes  foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets expense  intangible assets amortization and other expenses 
other expenses may include  but are not limited to  losses on the exchange of bank owned life insurance  professional fees  advertising  travel and training

decreased net interest income due to decreased loan yields and higher costs of funds 
asset quality improvement including a decrease of nonperforming assets of million or 
noninterest income decline of million or due to a reduction in gains on the sale of assets compared to this decline was offset by the sale of the credit card portfolio in the th quarter  resulting in a gain of million 
noninterest expense decline of million or 
this was mainly due to the following items exchange of bank owned life insurance policies which resulted in a million loss and million reversal of a tax reserve in the rd quarter 
reversal of deferred compensation and salary continuation agreements of million related to the unfortunate passing of a former bank executive in the rd quarter 
financial results were shaped by the following loan growth of million or and deposit growth of million or 
additional provision for loan losses and charge offs in the nd and th quarters in the amount of million and million  respectively 
noninterest income increase of million or due mainly to the sale of ione  washington branch and deposits in the nd quarter  resulting in a million gain on sale and a reduction of deposits of million 
in addition  there was million in gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets and other assets 
noninterest expense increase of million or due mainly to foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed asset write downs of million 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased to million in compared to million in results were a increase over results 
the decline in is due mainly to an increase in interest rates which caused the deposit and borrowing costs to increase over the year without a corresponding increase in interest income 
during the year  management of the company focused on decreasing the overall risk profile in the loan portfolio which resulted in originations of new loans at lower interest rates relative to key indexes 
this contributed to the minimal interest income growth related to loans despite the increase in market interest rates 
additionally  the increased competition for loans contributed to lower loan yields 
the interest income on securities has also declined from the current year as compared to this decline is due mainly to a significantly lower average investment balance during the year and no payments of federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb dividends for a majority of the year 
other interest income is higher than in previous years as the company maintained higher overnight interest bearing deposits with other banks during the year 
awbc s net interest margin to average earning assets was in this is a decline from and in and  respectively 
the decline from the prior years is due to the decreasing yield on loans to 
table of contents in from and for and  respectively 
in addition  the cost of funds on deposits has increased to in from and in and  respectively 
the current year increase in deposit rates is due mainly to rising interest rates 
the costs of overnight and other borrowings for have increased over the last two years also due to rising interest rates

securities interest income was lower due mainly to lower average balances 
interest bearing liabilities had an unfavorable impact on net interest income due to higher rates during the year 
during  increases in average balances of loans and securities had a favorable impact on interest income that was partially offset by a decline in yields 
a decline in rates on interest bearing liabilities had a more favorable impact than the unfavorable impact of larger average balances 

table of contents during the year ended december   awbc s management reclassified brokered loan fee income from interest income to noninterest income on the statements of income 
in addition  awbc s management reclassified loans held for sale as a separate line item on the statement of condition

the interest rates on loans vary with the degree of risk and amount of the loan  and are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  the availability of funds and government regulations 
approximately of the loans in the company s portfolio have interest rates that adjust based on a spread to market reference rates 
the market reference rates are based on various indices such as the prime rates of interest charged by money center banks  the fhlb borrowing rates or london interbank offering rates libor 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses decreased to million in from million in and million in in  the provision for loan losses was in line with management s expectations given the significant efforts taken during the past two years to improve the credit quality of the portfolio 
during  the company took two large provisions  one in may and one in december 
the may provision and subsequent charge off of million was related to a single borrowing relationship with a company that provided telecommunications and electricity transmission infrastructure 
the december provision of million was related to deterioration of several large loans and a general loan portfolio review 

table of contents provisions are made to reserve for known and inherent risk characteristics within the loan portfolio 
awbc regularly evaluates the level of provision and the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by considering such factors as current loan grades  historical loss rates  change in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends  current economic factors and estimated impact of current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to pay 
the provision for loan losses is an estimate and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different provision for loan losses 
if negative trends and expectations of management do not materialize  the allowance may be high relative to the actual performance of the asset portfolio 
this would lead to future provisions being less than the current provision 
likewise  if positive trends and expectations of management fail to come to fruition  the provision for loan losses in the current period may be inadequate and future provisions may be larger 
noninterest income 
noninterest income consists of fees and service charges  brokered loan fees  increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance  gains and losses on the sale of assets  and other income 
noninterest income decreased to million in compared to the decrease is due in part to the million gain on sale of the ione  washington branch during the company also recognized million in gains on sale of foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets and other assets during the foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets gains in were minimal 
the decrease in income from the prior year is partially offset by the sale of the company s credit card portfolio in the fourth quarter of this sale resulted in a million gain 
income from fees and service charges remained consistent in and at million 
brokered fee income also remained consistent in and at million 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense decreased by to million in compared to the reason for the decrease was an reduction in foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets expense to million in due to significant asset write downs in the previous year 
the write downs during were minimal 
this decline was partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased to million in compared to during the current year  there was a reversal of a deferred compensation accrual related to the unfortunate passing of a previous executive which offset the salary continuation plan expenses for absent this reversal  the salaries and employee benefits expense would have increased by 
an increase in the full time equivalent employees count from the previous year contributed to this increase 
awb has hired a combination of new production and support staff to drive profitability going forward 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million in due to new facilities being placed into service in late and increased utility and maintenance costs 
in addition  during  the company updated and improved existing technology throughout the organization which resulted in increased expenses for the year 
these expenditures are enabling awb to support growth and expansion initiatives 
other expenses increased to million in due to the exchange of bank owned life insurance policies which resulted in a million loss  higher professional fees of million and increased training  travel and employee development costs of million 
state business and occupation tax of million and intangible assets amortization of million for were similar to the results 
provision for income tax 
provision for income tax for the year ended december  decreased as a percentage of income before income tax to compared to for the year ended december  the slight decrease in the tax rate is due to the reversal of a million tax reserve recorded in for the anticipated surrender of some bank owned life insurance policies 
these policies were exchanged  rather than surrendered  during and this resulted in a million write down of the asset rather than a tax loss

the bank has classified million in loans to a construction company in milton freewater  oregon as nonaccrual due to the borrower s continued inability to demonstrate adequate cash flow to service this debt 
the entity continues to operate  and the borrower is compiling a plan that the bank will evaluate for adequacy in reducing the amount of the loans to match the borrower s debt service capacity 
the bank has acquired title to a residential subdivision in yakima  washington 
it is currently carried in foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets at million 
the company is currently marketing this property both as a bulk product and as individual lots 
the bank has classified million in loans to an assisted living facility operator located in yakima  washington as nonaccrual due to delinquency and an inability to demonstrate cash flow 
subsequent to year end  the loans were paid in full 
the bank has evaluated collateral coverage of the principal balances of the assets that are nonperforming and has provided for specific reserves related to these assets of million  in addition to the company s general reserves 
in january  the bank recognized two related loans totaling million as nonaccrual due to the principal guarantor seeking relief under a chapter bankruptcy filing during the month 
the loans are related to private investments of the guarantor and a casino operation located in western washington that is owned in part by the guarantor 
the casino continues to operate  but has insufficient cash flow to service the associated debt without support from the guarantor 
at this time  the bank has not received schedules from the trustee that would indicate an inability of the guarantor to honor the obligations and awb management believes that it maintains adequate reserves against any potential losses 
the assets are secured in part by stock of unrelated publicly traded companies and the assets of the casino operation 
the company has been named to the creditor s committee  and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on an ongoing basis 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for credit losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses primarily resulting from loans outstanding 
accordingly  all credit losses are charged to the allowance and all recoveries are credited to it 
the provision for credit losses charged to operating expense is based on past credit loss experience and other factors  which in management s judgment deserve current recognition in estimating probable credit losses 
such other factors include growth and composition of the loan portfolio  credit concentrations  trends in portfolio volume  maturities  delinquencies and nonaccruals  the relationship of the allowance for credit losses to outstanding loans  historical loss trends and general economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to base its estimates  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions  particularly in the company s market  differ substantially from the assumptions used 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
awbc utilizes a loan loss reserve methodology and documentation process which it believes is consistent with sec accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues 
additionally  awbc adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
these accounting pronouncements require specific identification of an allowance for loan loss for an impaired or nonperforming loan 
to this end  awbc developed a systematic methodology using a nine grade scale system to determine its allowance for loan losses 
on at least a quarterly basis  the allowance is recalculated using a disciplined approach to determine if the amount allocated is adequate 

table of contents this methodology includes a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio that is performed by competent and well trained personnel who have the skills and experience to perform analyses  estimates  reviews and other loan loss methodology functions 
all loans are considered in the analysis whether on an individual or group basis  using current and reliable data 
loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis  if applicable  and the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
management considers all relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collections  including interest  if applicable 
additionally  the methodology includes consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending 
current collateral values  less costs to sell  are considered in cases where this type of analysis is applicable 
the analysis ensures the loan loss allowance balance and methodology is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
at december   the company had approximately million of loans that were not classified as nonperforming but for which known information about the borrower s financial condition caused management to have concern about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the repayment terms of the loans 
these loans were identified through the loan review process described above that provides for assignment of a risk rating based on a nine grade scale 
based on the evaluation of current market conditions  loan collateral  other secondary sources of repayment and cash flow generation  management does not anticipate any significant losses related to these loans 
these loans are subject to continuing management attention and are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
a decline in the economic conditions in the company s market areas or other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual or transferred to foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets in the future

cash flows from operations contribute significantly to liquidity  as do proceeds from maturities of securities and increasing customer deposits 
in  awbc generated million of net cash flows from its operating activities compared to million in additionally  the company generated million and million in net cash from financing activities in and  respectively 
awb s primary source of funds is its deposits 
in addition  awb has the ability to borrow from various sources  including the federal home loan bank fhlb and correspondent banks that provide fed funds lines 
at december   awb had approximately million of available credit after deducting outstanding borrowings from these sources compared to million at december  during  the fhlb raised awb s line of credit to of assets  subject to collateral requirements  from of assets that was applicable at the prior year end 
awb initiated three new fed funds lines during to bring its total to five correspondent banks 
subsequent to year end  a sixth fed funds line was initiated 
the parent company had cash balances of million as of december  cash received from the exercise of options was more than sufficient to cover its obligations during  including servicing the junior subordinated debentures of million which were issued in september of the parent company did not pay any dividends on its common stock or repurchase any shares in the year ended december  subsequent to december   the parent company has established a million line of credit with one of its correspondent banks for general corporate purposes 
the parent company s ability to incur indebtedness is limited by government regulations and its ability to service borrowings is generally dependent upon the availability of dividends from awb 
the payments of dividends by awb are subject to limitations imposed by law and governmental regulations 
in determining whether the board of directors of awb or awbc will declare a dividend  the boards consider factors including financial condition  anticipated growth  acquisition opportunities  and applicable laws  regulations and regulatory capital requirements 
awbc s total stockholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  at december   stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  at december  and  awbc also held cash and cash equivalent assets of million and million  respectively 
the capital levels of awbc and the awb exceeded applicable regulatory well capitalized guidelines at december  and regulatory capital ratios can be reviewed in note regulatory matters 
effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on awbc s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods 
table of contents and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary

such financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading and are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received 
the following summarizes the amount of commitments per expiration period in thousands less than year years years thereafter total commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written total new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
this statement will be adopted on january  as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be fully predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had awbc adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in addition  the accounting for performance based shares on the balance sheet is modified and will eliminate the unearned compensation line item from equity 
this adjustment will not change the total equity balance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the primary form of market risk to which banks are exposed is interest rate risk 
this is the effect of changes in interest rates on a bank s income  fair values of assets and liabilities  and capital 
any changes in interest rates will impact the bank s net interest income  the spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
awbc has an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of senior managers and a board of directors representative  to monitor interest rate risk 
the alco meets quarterly to review current interest rate sensitivity and plan balance sheet and pricing strategies 
the alco looks at many components of interest rate risk 
repricing risk results from differences between the timing of market rate changes and the timing of cash flows of the bank s assets and liabilities 
basis risk comes from changes in the relationship between different market rates on assets and liabilities and their impact on the bank s earnings 
yield curve risk arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve 
all of these aspects of interest rate risk must be considered by the bank in monitoring its market risk profile 
as is true for any banking services provider  unfavorable changes in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  rising interest rates are generally associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
while an increase in the general level of interest rates may increase our net interest margin and loan yields  it may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers with variable rate loans to make principal and interest payments on their obligations 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume and overall profitability 
net interest income sensitivity to monitor the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income  awbc employs an interest rate simulation model 
the model integrates existing balance sheet maturity and repricing detail with various assumptions including prepayment projections and interest rate spreads over key index rates 
this simulation measures changes in net interest income over one year if market interest rates move in even increments up or down by and basis points  that is  if rates change by and basis points each month over months 
all yield curve shifts are parallel in this simulation  any loans or deposits that prepay or mature are replaced by like instruments to keep the balance sheet constant 
based on the simulation results  shown below as of december  and  awbc s net interest income will increase under rising interest rates and decline under falling interest rates  indicating that awbc is slightly asset sensitive 
percentage change in net interest income over months rate scenario rates increase gradually basis points rates increase gradually basis points not available rates decrease gradually basis points rates decrease gradually basis points not available 
table of contents during  the bank s asset sensitivity is somewhat amplified due to the increased proportions of floating rate loans and noninterest bearing demand deposits in its portfolios 
it should be noted that the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast by awbc and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future operating results 
again  these hypothetical estimates are based on numerous assumptions including but not limited to the nature and timing of interest rate levels  yield curve shape  repayments on loans and securities  and pricing decisions on loans and deposits 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the varying impact on adjustable rate assets of interest rate change caps and floors  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  and depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that the alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  awbc management cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
the company s policy sets limits on allowable change in one year net interest income if rates rise or fall by basis points 
percentage changes noted in the table above are within these limits 
economic value of equity as a further means of quantifying interest rate risk  awbc management looks at the economic perspective by capturing the impact of interest rate changes on the net value of future cash flows  or economic value of equity eve 
to determine the economic value of equity  cash flows projected from the company s current assets and liabilities are discounted based on current market rates 
investment securities are valued using current market prices 
loans are discounted at current awbc pricing spreads to market reference rates 
deposits and borrowings are discounted based on the fhlb yield curve as of the simulation date 
deposit cash flows include federal reserve bank estimates of operating costs for each deposit type 
the table below shows the effect on equity of market value changes of the company s financial assets and liabilities if interest rates change immediately up or down by or basis points as of december  rate scenario percentage change in eve rates increase basis points rates increase basis points rates decrease basis points rates decrease basis points the company s policy sets limits on allowable change in the economic value of equity if rates rise or fall by basis points 
percentage changes noted in the table above are within these limits 
since the market value of the company s equity would increase with rising interest rates  this table again indicates awbc is slightly asset sensitive 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity the table below presents awbc s balance sheet with estimated repricing information as of december  it indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets repricing during the first year 
it should be noted that transaction deposits comprise the major portion of these liabilities  and changes in rates on these deposits often occur after changes to key index rates on loans 
repricing interval in thousands months months years over years non rate sensitive total assets overnight interest bearing deposits with other banks securities loans noninterest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and mmda time deposits fhlb advances other borrowings and capital lease obligations junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate repricing gap cumulative repricing gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets
