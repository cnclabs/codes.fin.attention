item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this annual report 
in  considerable resources in terms of time and funds were invested to position the company for positive future results 
the year was marked by continued restructuring  re shaping and upgrading of the company s processes and business segments 
throughout  company wide action to secure land entitlements for the kapalua mauka project  a planned residential community  was a top priority for management 
kapalua mauka is considered by the company as the single most important project that can fuel the strategic direction that is envisioned for its agricultural and resort operations in the next several years 
the change in zoning process for kapalua mauka ended in pending maui county council approval 
in february  the company received final zoning approval from the maui county council to change kapalua mauka s zoning from agricultural to west maui project district  which allows a mix of up to homes and condominiums  five acres of commercial space  and up to holes of golf 
in february  the company s board of directors approved the investment of million for the construction of a new multi commodity multi client processing facility that would replace the existing pineapple cannery at kahului  maui and the fresh fruit packing facility located in upcountry maui 
in january  modifications to the project scope  rising construction costs and other factors led management and the board of directors to conclude that the company should first focus on completing the new fresh packing facility portion of the project and defer the remainder of the project 
the project as revised includes the expenditure of million for the new fresh packing facility and the deferral of construction of the processed plant portion to the new facility will be constructed on a portion of the present cannery site in kahului and is expected to reduce the company s overall cost structure by automating and integrating much of the fresh and processed fruit grading and packing operations 
the revised project plan also includes the expenditure of million for construction of a new office area for the company s corporate headquarters and support services accounting  information technology and human resources 
this office area will be constructed within an existing warehouse at the kahului cannery and will utilize recycled materials from the kapalua bay hotel  which is scheduled for demolition in april other significant transactions  events and key initiatives that took place in included the company sold approximately acres of upcountry maui land

demolition of the kapalua bay hotel is planned for april and presales of the condominiums will begin in may construction is expected to continue through description of business agriculture maui pineapple company  ltd 
is the operating subsidiary for the company s agriculture segment 
the company owns and operates fully integrated facilities for the production of fresh and processed pineapple 
the company s current strategy is to expand its presence in the fresh pineapple market  while selectively reducing its reliance on the processed pineapple market 
therefore  over recent years  the company has decreased the tonnage of fruit going to the cannery and  in  began to commensurately reduce the number of markets for processed pineapple that it serves 
the company s strategy focuses on marketing only the highest quality fresh pineapple by using the processed pineapple operations to complement the fresh operations 
the company directs fruit to either the processed or the fresh packing facility at the time of harvest based on a variety of factors  including market conditions  fruit size and fruit quality 
in  sales of fresh pineapple represented approximately of net pineapple sales compared to in and in the transition of the company s agriculture operations continues with an emphasis on automating many labor intensive functions and upgrading the workforce through selective training and performance based compensation programs 
planting  harvesting and seasonality the fresh fruit market is a year round business  which requires consistency of supply 
over the past two years  the company has made significant progress in changing its agronomic practices and planting schedules to produce a more consistent and predictable supply of fruit throughout the year 
in addition  the company has made significant progress in implementing improved crop maintenance and agronomic practices that are beginning to improve plant yields tons of fruit per acre and fruit quality 
planting and harvesting take place throughout the year 
two pineapple crops are normally harvested from each new planting 
the first  or plant crop  is harvested approximately to months after planting  the second  or ratoon crop  is harvested to months later 
a third crop  the second ratoon  may be harvested to months later depending on a number of conditions 
the company s processed pineapple operations have historically had a seasonal operating cycle 
the seasonality of the processing operation is not only due to the pineapple s natural tendency to ripen during the summer months  but also because the timing of initial planting and initiation of flowering can promote ripening during the summer 
during the summer months  student labor for the harvesting and processing operations is also more readily available 
as the company shifts its operations towards the fresh fruit market and accordingly adjusts its agronomic practices  the seasonality of the business is becoming less pronounced 
in  the company expects to continue the transition of its pineapple operations with an increased emphasis on the fresh fruit market 
the seasonality of the processing operation does not specifically affect sales or earnings because sales are driven by consumer consumption and resupply orders by customers 
the availability of water for irrigation is critical to the cultivation of pineapple 
the upcountry maui area  in which the company maintains a plantation  is susceptible to drought conditions  which can adversely affect pineapple operations by resulting in poor yields tons per acre and lower recoveries the amount of saleable product per ton of fruit processed 
approximately of the fields in the company s upcountry maui plantation are equipped with drip irrigation systems 
the company is also shifting more of its plantings to its west maui plantation  which is less susceptible to drought conditions 
packing and cannery facilities harvested pineapple is packed for fresh shipment at the company s packing facility located at its upcountry maui plantation 
pineapple that will be canned is processed at the company s cannery in kahului where a range of processed pineapple products are produced  including solid pineapple in various grades and styles  juice and juice concentrates 
the cannery is located in a foreign trade zone and operates most of the year 
the metal containers used in canning pineapple are produced in a company owned can plant at the cannery site 
the metal is imported from manufacturers in japan 
a warehouse is maintained at the cannery site for inventory purposes 
the company is presently constructing a new fresh fruit packing facility that will replace the facility in upcountry maui 
the new facility will be constructed on a portion of the present cannery site in kahului and is expected to reduce the company s overall cost structure by integrating and automating much of the fresh and processed fruit grading and packing operations 
products and distribution the company sells fresh whole pineapple from hawaii to retail and wholesale grocers in hawaii and the continental united states 
beginning in november  the company s fresh premium pineapple is sold under the maui gold and hawaiian goldtm brand names 
the company sells processed pineapple products as store brand pineapple with hawaiian usa stamped on the can lid 
its products are sold principally to large grocery chains  other food processors  wholesale grocers  the united states government and to organizations offering a complete buyers brand program to affiliated chains and wholesalers serving both retail and food service outlets 
a substantial volume of the company s pineapple products is marketed through food brokers  which is administered through the company s sales office in concord  california 
the company sells pineapple juice and pineapple juice blended with orange juice in plastic polyethyleneteraphthalate bottles in various sizes to large grocery chains in the continental united states 
the pineapple juice ingredients are shipped in bulk from the company s cannery on maui to co packers on the mainland that bottle the juice to the company s specifications 
as a service to its customers  the company maintains inventories of its products in six public warehouses in the continental united states 
the number of warehouses was reduced from in to six in the balance of its products is shipped directly from hawaii to its customers 
the company s processed pineapple products are shipped from hawaii by ocean transportation and are then transported by truck or rail to customers or to public warehouses 
fresh whole pineapple is shipped by air or by ocean transportation 
in  approximately united states customers accounted for approximately of the company s processed and fresh pineapple sales 
sales of hawaii grown pineapple to customers located in foreign countries  primarily to japan and canada  amounted to approximately of the company s processed pineapple sales in  and sales to the united states government  mainly the department of agriculture  amounted to approximately  and of processed pineapple sales in  and  respectively 
competition the company sells its products in competition with both foreign and united states companies 
its principal competitors are dole food company  inc  del monte food co  and del monte fresh produce company  each of which produces substantial quantities of fresh and or processed pineapple products  a significant portion of which is produced in central america and southeast asia 
other major sources of competition in the processed pineapple sector are thailand and indonesia 
foreign production has the advantage of lower land  water  labor and regulatory costs 
the company s principal marketing advantages are the high quality of its fresh and processed pineapple  the relative proximity to the united states west coast fresh fruit market  and being the only processor of pineapple in the united states 
the price of the company s products is influenced by supply and demand of pineapple products and other fruits and juices 
in february  del monte fresh produce company announced that it would end its pineapple production in hawaii after the current growing cycle  which will be in resort kapalua land company  ltd

see other assets kapalua bay holdings  llc  note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company must obtain appropriate entitlements for land that it intends to develop 
securing proper land entitlement is a process that requires obtaining county  state and federal approvals  which can take many years to complete and entails a variety of risks 
the entitlement process requires that the company satisfy all conditions and restrictions imposed in connection with such governmental approvals  including among other things  construction of infrastructure improvements  payment of impact fees  restrictions on permitted uses of the land  and provision of affordable housing 
the company actively works with the community  regulatory agencies  and legislative bodies at all levels of government in an effort to obtain necessary entitlements consistent with the needs of the community 
the company has including property owned by bay holdings approximately  acres of land in maui that are at various stages in the land entitlement process as follows number zoned for location of acres planned use kapalua resort yes other kapalua resort and west maui no upcountry no the company began selling phase i in and phase ii in of the honolua ridge subdivision at the kapalua resort

the price and market for luxury real estate on maui has in the past been highly cyclical based upon interest rates  the popularity of hawaii as a vacation destination  the general condition of the economy in the united states and asia  and the relationship of the dollar to foreign currencies

risk factors dependency on certain key personnel 
the company is currently dependent upon the ability and experience of certain key management employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain their services 
the company does not currently carry key man insurance on any of these individuals  and loss of one or more could have a material adverse effect on financial results 
real estate investments are subject to numerous risks 
the company is subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property because it develops and sells real property  primarily for residential use 
also  the company has a ownership interest in kapalua bay holdings llc  which owns and operates the kapalua bay hotel 
when interest rates increase  the cost of acquiring  developing  expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decrease 
similarly  as financing becomes less available  it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property 
under eminent domain laws  governments can take real property 
sometimes this taking is for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  equity real estate investments may be difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to adjust our portfolio of properties quickly in response to economic or other conditions 
if the company is unable to complete land development projects within forecasted timing and budgeting  or at all  financial results may be negatively affected 
the company intends to develop resort and other properties  as suitable opportunities arise  taking into consideration the general economic climate 
new project developments have a number of risks  including risks associated with construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  development costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  fires or other natural disasters that could adversely impact a project  defects in design or construction that may result in additional costs to remedy or require all or a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the situation  ability to raise capital  governmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project or timing of completion  and potential lack of adequate building construction capacity for large development projects 
if any development project is not completed on time or within budget  this could have a materially adverse affect on the company s financial results 
if the company is unable to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonable costs  or at all  its operating results would be adversely affected 
the company s financial results are highly dependant on its community development operating segment 
the financial performance of our community development segment is closely related to the company s success in obtaining land use entitlements for proposed development projects 
obtaining all of the necessary entitlements to develop a parcel of land is often difficult  costly and may take several years  or more  to complete 
in some situations  the company may be unable to obtain the necessary entitlements to proceed with a real estate development or may be required to alter its plans for the development 
delays or failures to obtain these entitlements may have a materially adverse affect on the company s financial results 
the historical price and market for luxury real estate on maui has been highly cyclical and if the market demand for luxury real estate were to decrease  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
the highs and lows in the market cycle can prevail for multiple years at a time 
during low periods of demand  real estate product may remain in inventory for much longer than expected or be sold at lower than expected returns  or even at a loss  which could impair the company s liquidity and ability to proceed with additional land development projects and negatively affect the company s operating results 
if the company is unable to successfully compete with other developers of luxury real estate on maui  its financial results could be materially affected 
the company s real estate product faces competition from other luxury resort real estate properties on maui  and from other luxury resort residential property in hawaii and the mainland united states 
in many cases  the company s competitors are larger than it is and have greater access to capital 
if the company is unable to compete with these larger competitors  its financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
if the company cannot attract and retain skilled workers for its resort operations  its financial results could be negatively impacted 
there is a potential lack of adequate skilled workers on maui for larger development projects 
the company s three golf courses require a large number of course and facility maintenance and operations workers  and the hotel and villas require housekeepers  food and beverage servers  front desk  and other operational and hospitality workers 
overall  the company s resort operations require a large number of workers to maintain the quality and level of service that it strives to provide to its customers 
the company s plans for development projects require that there be adequate labor in all of the construction trades 
the labor market on maui is very competitive  with the labor premium in west maui being even greater than elsewhere on maui 
the cost and insufficient supply of housing and the absence of adequate public services  such as schools  continue to be an impediment to attracting and retaining labor 
if the company and other maui businesses are unable to gain approvals from the government to allow for the expansion of affordable housing and to implement plans to provide a higher level of public services  including schools  further development in west maui could be severely restricted  which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
while the company proposes to pay its fair share for the provision of affordable housing and the construction of infrastructure  there are political factions in the county government who do not want any further development 
the company may be subject to certain environmental regulations under which it may have additional liability and experience additional costs for land development 
various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations regulate the company s properties and could make the company liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in property it currently owns or operates or that it previously owned or operated 
these laws could impose liability without regard to whether the company knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly clean up such substances when present  could jeopardize the company s ability to develop  use  sell or rent the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
if the company arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes  it could be liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up wastes at the disposal or treatment facility  even if it never owned or operated that facility 
certain laws  ordinances and regulations  particularly those governing the management or preservation of wetlands  coastal zones and threatened or endangered species  could limit the company s ability to develop  use  sell or rent its real property 
the company s agriculture operations face significant competition from companies with greater financial resources and from foreign competition with lower cost structures 
the company sells its products in competition with both foreign and united states companies 
its principal competitors are three companies  dole food company  inc  del monte food co  and del monte fresh produce company  each of which produce substantial quantities of pineapple products  a significant portion of which is produced in central america and southeast asia 
other producers of pineapple products in thailand and indonesia also are a major source of competition 
producers of pineapple in foreign countries have substantially lower land  water  labor and regulatory costs than the company 
the company s marketing strategy is to compete based on the premium quality of our fresh pineapple product and being the only company that cans all of its pineapple in the united states 
if it cannot compete effectively with these larger companies and lower cost producers  its financial results could be adversely affected 
weather conditions such as drought  extreme cold and torrential rainfall can have an adverse impact on crop production 
the fresh market requires steady and predictable fruit delivery 
the accelerated movement of processed product inventory has reduced sales stock 
adverse weather conditions may interrupt planting  growing and crop delivery and affect operating results 
the company has diversified growing regions to central and west maui to mitigate some of this weather related risks 
if the company is unable to successfully compete with other producers of fresh and processed pineapple  our financial results could be materially affected 
the fresh and processed pineapple markets are highly competitive 
a decline in the price of pineapple or increases in the price of fuel or packaging materials could adversely affect operating results 
agricultural chemicals used in the past have resulted in contingent liabilities that could result in future claims against the company 
one customer has provided a substantial portion of the company s processed pineapple sales  the loss of this customer may have a material adverse effect on operating results 
the united states government represented approximately  and of the company s processed pineapple sales for  and  respectively 
it is difficult to predict whether the united states government will continue to represent such a significant portion of our processed pineapple sales in the future because the company does not have a long term contract to supply pineapple to the government 
if the company were to lose this customer  operating results would be negatively affected 
because the company is located in hawaii and therefore apart from the mainland united states  it is more sensitive to certain economic factors  which may adversely affect operating results 
the company s community development segment and the resort segment are dependent on attracting visitors to kapalua and to maui and the state of hawaii as a whole 
economic factors that affect the number of visitors  their length of stay or expenditure levels will affect our financial performance 
factors such as the cost of energy  events in the airline industry that affect passenger capacity or traveling cost  and the threat  or perceived threat  of heightened terrorist activity in the united states  could affect a potential visitors choice of vacation destination or second home location 
the company s agriculture operations are dependent on ocean shipment and airfreight to transport processed and fresh pineapple to customers in the united states 
increases in the cost of energy  and other factors that affect the cost and reliability of ocean shipment and airfreight will affect the financial results of the company s agriculture segment

current developments in  considerable resources in terms of time and funds were invested to position the company for positive future results 
the year was marked by continued restructuring  re shaping and upgrading of the company s processes and business segments 
throughout  company wide action to secure land entitlements for the kapalua mauka project  a planned residential community  was a top priority for management 
kapalua mauka is considered by the company as the single most important project that can fuel the strategic direction that is envisioned for its agricultural and resort operations in the next several years 
the change in zoning process for kapalua mauka ended pending maui county council approval 
in february  the company received final zoning approval from the maui county council to change kapalua mauka s zoning from agricultural to west maui project district  which allows a mix of up to homes and condominiums  five acres of commercial space  and up to holes of golf 
in february  the company s board of directors approved the investment of million for the construction of a new multi commodity multi client processing facility that would replace the existing pineapple cannery at kahului  maui and the fresh fruit packing facility located upcountry maui 
in january  modifications to the project scope  rising construction costs and other factors led management and the board of directors to conclude that the company should first focus on completing the new fresh packing facility portion of the project and defer the remainder of the project 
the project as revised includes the expenditure of million for the new fresh packing facility and the deferral of construction of the processed plant portion to the new facility will be constructed on a portion of the present cannery site in kahului and is expected to reduce the company s overall cost structure by automating and integrating the fresh and processed grading and packing operations 
the revised project plan also includes the expenditure of million for construction of a new office area for the company s corporate headquarters and support services accounting  information technology and human resources 
this office area will be constructed within an existing warehouse at the kahului cannery and will utilize recycled materials from the kapalua bay hotel  which is scheduled for demolition in april other significant transactions  events and key initiatives that took place in included the company sold approximately acres of upcountry maui land 
the company will re invest the million net cash sales proceeds from these transactions million pre tax gain to strengthen its agriculture segment operations  reposition the resort operations and to increase investments in its community development segment 
from april through july  the plantation course was closed for regrassing of the greens  renovation of the fairway bunkers and other course improvements 
in june  the newly renovated restaurant at the bay course clubhouse opened under new management 
the sale of the agricultural home sites in honolua ridge phase ii began in august and seven lot sales closed escrow by year end 
construction of the offsite improvements for this lot residential subdivision  ranging in size from to acres  began in august and is expected to be completed in october groundbreaking and a blessing for honolua village phase i was held in september 
construction of this  square foot commercial space in the central resort area is expected to be completed in mid in december  the company received a special management area permit for the construction of new whole and fractional residences on the property that is presently the kapalua bay hotel 
demolition of the kapalua bay hotel is planned for april and presales of the condominiums will begin in may construction is expected to continue through results of operations comparison of years ended december  and consolidated years ended december  change inc dollars in millions  except per share amounts consolidated revenues net income loss earnings per common share the company reported net income of million per share for compared to a net loss of  
per share for consolidated revenues were million for  an increase of from million for the improved results in were primarily attributable to revenues and operating profit from the community development segment as a result of sales of real estate inventories and the sale of other real estate  as further described below 
included in income for are charges of approximately million pre tax related to the restructuring of the company s processes and operations 
general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses increased by to million compared to million for the major components of the difference in general and administrative expenses were as follows years ended december  inc dec dollars in millions salaries and wages depreciation and asset write offs professional and other outside services medical insurance premiums employee incentives and stock compensation employee severance expense other net total the increase in salaries and wages is primarily the result of additional employees in the community development segment in expansion of the community development staff was necessary in order to accomplish the projects and initiatives for this segment 
the increase in employee incentives and stock compensation expense was principally the result of accruals for performance based incentives  reflecting the company s increased emphasis on performance based pay plans 
the decrease in medical insurance premiums in largely reflects the reduction in the work force in the agriculture segment that occurred in and in employee severance expense was lower in because of management changes at the corporate level in in addition  employee severance charges  arising from reduction in the work force in the agriculture segment  were approximately million in  compared to  in the increase in depreciation and asset write offs charged to general and administrative expenses primarily relate to acceleration of depreciation charges on certain assets from the current cannery  can plant and fresh fruit processing facility  acceleration of depreciation charges on the company s integrated accounting system  write off of assets related to the company s payroll and human resource accounting system  and the write off of other assets that the company has ceased to use 
the company is currently constructing a processing facility to replace its fresh fruit packing plant  and has plans to begin construction of a multi commodity multi client processing facility to replace its cannery and can plant in in  the company began to evaluate the agriculture segment assets and record depreciation charges related to the change in estimated useful life of these assets 
the company estimated that agriculture segment assets with a net book value of approximately million will be expensed over the month period ending december  this resulted in additional depreciation charges of million in in  as the company evaluated its businesses  operations and processes it became evident that the accounting systems currently in use are not able to meet the company s needs 
the company s payroll and human resource accounting functions were outsourced to a third party provider at the end of and the net book value of the related in house systems was written off 
in the fourth quarter of  the company concluded plans to replace the other primary accounting systems that it is using and began to accelerate the depreciation of the existing accounting systems 
current plans are to conclude the implementation of new accounting systems in evaluation of the company s fixed assets in also resulted in the identification of assets that the company will no longer use because of changes in plans and operations 
in  the company expensed million for these asset write offs and acceleration of depreciation for accounting systems 
the increase in professional services in reflects the cost of outside consultants primarily to assist the company in documenting its internal controls and processes required  in part  by the requirements section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in professional services also reflects charges incurred in for modifications and adjustments to the company s integrated accounting system and additional training of the company s employees on use of the system 
reduction in staffing and staff turnover  particularly in the agriculture segment  necessitated re training of the staff 
general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the operating segments 
such allocations are consistent with management s evaluation of the operating segments 
interest expense interest expense of  for was lower by compared to the decrease in interest expense was due to lower average borrowings and to a higher amount of capitalized interest in see liquidity and capital resources  debt position 
capitalized interest was  for compared to  for  primarily as a result of construction activities at the kapalua resort 
the company s average interest rate on borrowings was in compared to in  due to higher borrowing rates from financial institutions 
agriculture years ended december  change dec dollars in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment produced an operating loss from continuing operations of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues for of million were lower than lower agriculture segment revenues in was due to a reduced sales volume of processed pineapple  which was partially offset by increased fresh pineapple sales volume and higher average prices for both processed and fresh pineapple in non recurring items the operating loss for includes million for asset write offs and additional depreciation charges for assets where the estimated useful lives were reduced because of changes in the operations of the agriculture segment  as mentioned in general and administrative above 
the operating loss for included million of asset write offs related to the restructuring of the agriculture segment operations 
revenues for include million received from the u 
s 
customs service compared to million received from this program in these cash distributions were made pursuant to the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of  or the cdsoa  which allows for distribution of antidumping duties to injured domestic producers 
the distributions are recorded as other income in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
anti dumping duties have been in effect on processed pineapple fruit imported from thailand since in late  the antidumping duty order on several thailand exporters of processed pineapple  which together accounted for more than of the thailand exports to the united states  was revoked 
as a result  these thailand exporters no longer have antidumping duties assessed on their exports to the united states 
these revocations have had  and will continue to have  an effect on the amount of funds collected and distributed to the company under the cdsoa 
fresh and processed operations the case volume of fresh pineapple sales increased by in compared to revenues from fresh pineapple sales were approximately and of the agriculture segment net sales for and  respectively 
the company s average revenue per box of fresh pineapple sales increased by approximately in compared to primarily reflecting the improved quality of its products and related marketing efforts 
the case volume of processed pineapple sales decreased by for compared to  primarily reflecting the company s strategy to sharply reduce supply to selected retail market segments 
this market refinement has resulted in the average sales prices for the company s processed pineapple products to increase by approximately for compared to the company implemented price increases for its processed product lines in march  june and august of  and in august processed pineapple sold to the u 
s 
government  primarily to the department of agriculture  comprised approximately of the company s case volume of processed pineapple sales in compared to approximately in the increase in the percentage of processed pineapple sales to the u 
s 
government is a result of lower overall processed pineapple sales and an increase in the company s participation in government programs that purchase pineapple for school lunches  needy families and other government programs 
the agriculture segment cost of sales was lower by for as compared to  primarily reflecting lower sales volume of processed pineapple 
the average per unit cost of sales was higher in compared to because the impact of a liquidation of inventory based on the lifo last in  first out method of accounting for inventories was higher in than in cost of sales in and would have been higher by million and million  respectively  based on current costs 
agriculture shipping and marketing cost decreased by million in  compared to  largely reflecting the lower sales volume of processed pineapple  partially offset by increased ocean and airfreight shipping costs per unit 
increased use of surface shipment  instead of the higher cost air shipment  was also responsible for the lower cost in the company s changes in cultivation practices  harvesting methods  and post harvest handling have extended the shelf life of fresh fruit products enabling the company to increase its reliance on surface transport to reach north american markets 
in  the company shipped approximately of its maui gold fresh pineapple by surface  rather than by air  compared to about in reductions in the work force at the company s sales and marketing office and an increase in shipments directly to the company s customers as opposed to interim storage of inventory in public warehouses  also contributed to lower shipping and marketing costs in outlook the company plans to complete the new fresh fruit packing facility by mid and expects that significant processing efficiencies will be gained when the new facility is in use 
the agriculture segment intends to continue planning and costing for the cannery and can plant aspects of the new processing facility  but does not expect to commence for that portion of the project until the segment will continue to refine its agronomic practices to produce a consistently premium product and continue its marketing efforts to obtain a larger percentage of direct customers 
resort years ended december  change inc dec dollars in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the resort segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for resort revenues of million for were higher than hotel and condominium room occupancies at the kapalua resort  and to a somewhat lesser extent for maui in general  largely drive the increase in resort activity as reflected by increased golf play  merchandise sales and lease revenues 
hotel and condominium room occupancies at kapalua resort increased by in compared to occupancies for the island of maui increased by and for the state of hawaii  occupancies increased by in compared to the closure of the plantation golf course as of april  for extended green and fairway bunker renovations was the single largest contributor to the increased operating losses in the renovations were completed on schedule and the course reopened on july  higher operating expenses at the kapalua resort were attributable to increases in staffing at the kapalua villas  and higher fuel and utility costs  repairs and maintenance costs  kapalua resort association dues  and increased costs for outside consultants 
marketing expenses were higher in compared to the prior year because of increased staffing and events reflecting greater emphasis on marketing the kapalua resort 
golf  merchandise and villas revenues from golf operations increased by in compared to lost revenues from the closure of the plantation course were offset by higher average green fees 
overall  paid rounds of golf decreased by for compared to average green and cart fees increased by in compared to the closure of the plantation course from april  through july  also negatively affected the kapalua resort s merchandise sales  which decreased by approximately for compared to increased sales at kapalua resort s other retail outlets  in part attributed to higher room occupancies  partially offset the effect of the plantation course closure 
gross revenues from the kapalua villas increased by approximately for compared to  reflecting both higher average room rates and occupancies 
outlook the company considers the upgrading of the kapalua resort with the current and planned projects and initiatives  key to sustained and increased revenues streams from the resort segment 
the company expects to assist owners in the renovation of up to kapalua gold villa units in in  demolition of the kapalua bay hotel  construction of the new residences at the kapalua bay hotel site and honolua village in the central resort  as well as the various other construction projects that will be taking place at kapalua resort may detract from the guest experience and thereby negatively affect the company s financial results 
however  the company believes that the risk of not moving forward with these projects to upgrade and add amenities to the kapalua resort facilities is far greater to the long term success of kapalua resort and the company as a whole 
community development years ended december  change inc dollars in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating profit the community development segment reported an operating profit of million for compared to million for revenues from this operating segment were million for compared to million for operating profit for includes  of losses from the company s equity interest in kapalua bay holdings  llc  compared to losses of  for real estate sales revenues for include million from the sale of approximately acres of land in upcountry maui  which resulted in operating profit of million

revenues for also include million from the march sale of a acre parcel at kapalua and  from the may sale of a custom home at pineapple hill estates that the company constructed as part of a joint venture 
real estate development and sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors 
results for one period are therefore  not necessarily indicative of future performance trends for this segment 
realty and leasing kapalua realty s commission income from the resale of residential units in the kapalua resort was lower in compared to  primarily because of fewer transactions  partially offset by higher average resale prices in revenues from leasing activities decreased by about for compared to the decrease primarily reflects the absence of lease revenues from the kapalua shops retail leases and from the kapalua bay hotel ground lease  which were contributed to kapalua bay llc in august comparison of years ended december  and consolidated years ended december  change inc dec dollars in millions  except per share amounts consolidated revenues net income loss earnings per common share the company reported a net loss for of  per share compared to net income of million per share for the sale of honolua ridge agricultural lots began in july  and contributed million to operating profit for the community development segment 
contributions to operating profit from honolua ridge lot sales were largely offset by operating losses from the company s agriculture and resort segments 
general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased by million in to million from million in the major components of the difference in general and administrative expenses were as follows years ended december  inc dec dollars in millions salaries and wages depreciation and asset write offs professional and other outside services medical insurance premiums employee incentives and stock compensation employee severance expense other net total the reduction in salaries in is primarily due to reductions in force in the agriculture segment 
the decrease in professional services largely reflects expenses incurred in for legal fees and consultant costs related to lawsuits in the agriculture segment  partially offset by increased costs in for outside consultants primarily related to the company s restructuring efforts and new business initiatives 
the agriculture segment lawsuits were settled in the company began stock compensation incentives for certain of its key managers and executives in the fourth quarter of the write off of assets relates primarily to the agriculture segment 
in  the company evaluated the fixed assets used in its agriculture operations in an effort to determine the most efficient usage of its assets based on the planned reduction in processed pineapple production  the shift in planting for the fresh fruit market  and changes in agronomic practices 
in september  the company decided to abandon certain assets because they were in excess of the agriculture division s current needs 
in october  the company ceased production of its fresh cut pineapple products and abandoned that product line 
fixed assets  inventory and supplies related to the fresh cut production totaling million were written off in the fourth quarter of general administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the business segment level 
in october  the company began to allocate all corporate general and administrative expenses to its business segments and prior year amounts were restated for comparability 
such allocations are consistent with management s evaluation of the business segments 
interest expense consolidated interest expense decreased by to million in compared to million in primarily because of lower average borrowings and a higher amount of interest capitalized in in  interest was capitalized on expenditures for construction of the infrastructure improvements for the honolua ridge subdivision 
the company s average interest rates on borrowings were 
higher in than in agriculture years ended december  change dec dollars in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment incurred an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for agriculture segment revenues for decreased by million to million compared to million for the decline in results was partially due to lower sales volumes and higher costs as described further in the paragraphs that follow 
the following non recurring gains reduced the operating loss from continuing operations in and nonrecurring items in december the company received million from the us customs service compared to million from this program in these cash distributions were made pursuant to the cdsoa  which allows for distribution of antidumping duties to injured domestic producers

see discontinued operations  note to the consolidated financial statements 
processed and fresh pineapple operations the volume of processed pineapple sales decreased by for as compared to  in large part reflecting the company s strategy to sharply reduce supply to selected market segments 
this market refinement has resulted in the average sales prices for the company s processed pineapple products to increase by approximately in compared to the company implemented price increases for its processed product lines in march  june and august increased sales to the us government partially offset the reduction in sales volume to other sectors of the market 
sales to the us government represented approximately of net processed pineapple sales in  compared to approximately in the sale of fresh pineapple represented approximately of net pineapple sales in compared to in the volume of fresh pineapple sales increased by in compared to although the average sales prices for fresh pineapple in were about lower than in  the company s net return after shipping cost on fresh pineapple sales was about higher in reflecting a decrease in the cost of shipping due to a change by the company in the mode of transportation to deliver product as described further below 
the decrease in fresh fruit sales prices in reflect the over supply market conditions in july and august due to precocious fruiting  particularly in costa rica  and highly competitive market conditions during the holiday season 
natural fruit differentiation  more commonly known as precocious fruiting  is a weather related phenomenon experienced in commercial pineapple production 
the effect is that pineapple plants begin to fruit naturally  usually during the summer  rather than under inducement 
during the summer of  precocious fruiting impacted nearly all fresh pineapple growing regions  including maui  thus creating over supply in all markets 
agriculture cost of sales decreased by in compared to primarily because of the reduction in processed pineapple case sales volume 
the company s pineapple inventories are maintained on a last in  first out  or lifo method of accounting 
therefore  in periods of rising prices  current production costs are higher than the average per unit values in inventory 
in  there was a partial liquidation of lifo inventories resulting in lower production costs from prior years being included in cost of sales 
cost of sales would have been higher by million based on production costs 
the average per unit cost of sales is higher in than because of increased costs incurred at the plantations and higher per unit cannery costs 
in  the company increased the total number of acres planted  with emphasis on hawaiian gold and organic pineapple 
in  the company expended approximately million more than twice the average of the prior two years for field preparation  crop maintenance  seed development and other expenditures in order to accomplish the agriculture segment production goals  which were to improve the quality and consistency of its products  improve yields and mitigate the precursor conditions of precocious fruiting 
these costs were included in cost of sales for because  under the company s accounting method  all pineapple production costs incurred at the plantation are charged to the cost of crops harvested for the year 
in addition  higher cost was incurred to harvest because of the precocious fruiting that occurred in the summer of rainfall at the company s pineapple plantations  particularly in the first months of  increased by as much as as compared to the average for the last five years 
this resulted in a delay of the company s pineapple planting schedule and increased costs as the plantations caught up with the planned planting schedules 
the agriculture segment shipping and marketing costs decreased by million in compared to the reduction in these costs is due to the streamlining of processed pineapple sales distribution  resulting in a lower average per unit shipping cost 
the reduction in fresh pineapple shipping costs in versus was due to greater use of surface shipment to the west coast of the united states for the company s fresh pineapple 
in  the company shipped approximately of its whole fresh pineapple by surface rather than by air 
airfreight was used in to mitigate the reduced shelf life of precocious fruit and to avoid the unloading delays at the harbor serving southern california 
in  the company shipped about of its fresh whole pineapple by surface 
the increased use of surface shipment in  which is substantially less costly  was possible partially because of the extended shelf life of the fruit resulting from improved post harvest practices 
the increased use of surface shipment reduced the average per unit fresh fruit shipping cost in by approximately compared to resort years ended december  change inc dec dollars in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss in  responsibility for the real estate leasing activity that was accounted for in the resort segment was transferred to the community development segment and amounts for and were restated for comparability 
remaining in the resort segment are the operations of three championship golf courses  a tennis facility  ten retail outlets  a vacation rental program the kapalua villas  and public utilities commission regulated water and sewage transmission operations at the kapalua resort 
the resort segment produced an operating loss of million for  compared to an operating loss of million for revenues from the resort segment increased by million to million in compared to million for operating profit for from the resort s golf and merchandise operations exceeded improved results from these operations were partially offset by lower lease revenues and lower results from the villas rental operations 
the resort also had higher operating and general and administrative expenses in because of costs for previously deferred maintenance of facilities  expenses incurred to enforce and protect the kapalua trade name  and increased fuel and energy cost 
rainfall at the kapalua resort through the first five months of was up to higher than the average for the prior five years and negatively affected the resort segment s operating results

promotional programs in to increase golf play and kapalua villa occupancies reduced the average green fees for most of increased revenues from the golf operations were partially offset by higher expenses due to new union contracts for the golf maintenance employees as of june and for the golf services employees as of march merchandise sales increased by in compared to due primarily to the increased number of visitors to kapalua and to additional retail floor space with the opening of the kapalua collections store at the end of the first quarter of revenues from the kapalua villas increased by in compared to  primarily reflecting increased occupancies 
the average daily room rates in were about lower than occupancy at the kapalua villas increased by approximately in compared to contribution to operating profit from the villas was approximately  lower in compared to lower results from the villas operations were largely due to maintenance and other expenditures to upgrade and improve the facilities  and the level of service provided by the kapalua villas
