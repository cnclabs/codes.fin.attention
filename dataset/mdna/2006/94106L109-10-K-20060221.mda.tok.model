item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december  this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item a  risk factors 
the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
overview waste management is the leading provider of comprehensive waste services in north america 
throughout  we continued to build a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality  reliable service  safety and environmental protection 
by continuing to cultivate this reputation and focusing on quality customer service  we accomplished our main financial objectives for of strong earnings growth  margin expansion and improved cash flow 
we believe that our pricing initiatives  which allowed us to grow our revenues by increasing our prices while maintaining solid volumes  were largely responsible for our improved financial performance 
significant financial achievements during the year ended december  include net cash provided by operating activities increased to billion and free cash flow increased to billion  increases of and  respectively  when compared with  internal revenue growth of for the fourth quarter of and for the full year  driven by increases in base business yield  which is the highest it has been in five years  improvements in our costs as a percentage of revenues  particularly in the second half of the year  despite margin pressure created by continued increases in the cost of fuel  and million in stock repurchases and million of dividends paid pursuant to our capital allocation plan 
cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap measure of financial performance that we include in our disclosures because we believe the production of free cash flow is an important measure of our liquidity and performance and because we believe our investors are interested in the cash we produce from non financing activities that is available for our acquisition program  share repurchase program  scheduled debt reduction and the payment of dividends 
the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities 
we calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from divestitures of businesses  net of cash divested  and other sales of assets free cash flow the growth in our operating and free cash flow reflects the current year improvements in our operating results  particularly those contributed by our increase in revenue from price  which is discussed below 
internal revenue growth internal revenue growth  or irg  is the change in our revenues from base business yield  commodities  electricity  fuel surcharges and fees  and volumes 
irg is an important indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase revenues from our existing operations 
our irg for the year was and consisted primarily of improvement in base business yield and an increase in revenues related to our fuel surcharge program 
revenue growth from yield on base business is the combined effects on our revenues from the pricing activities of our collection  transfer  disposal and waste to energy 
table of contents operations  exclusive of volume changes 
our revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price increases  but also includes i price decreases to retain customers  ii changes in average price from new and lost business  and iii certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services  which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided 
our revenue growth from base business yield for was  which is an increase of percentage points from the prior year 
in addition  our fuel surcharge program contributed million  or  to revenue growth in compared with million  or in the revenues generated by the program in substantially recovered the increase in our operating costs attributable to fuel 
margin improvement we use our net income as a percentage of revenues and income from operations as a percentage of revenues to gauge performance for employee incentive awards and to determine the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and strategies 
our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as a percentage of revenues increased in to from in this increase is largely due to a tax benefit resulting from tax audit settlements 
our income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in on an increase of million in revenue 
the decrease was caused primarily by million of additional expenses in when compared with related to asset impairments and unusual items and restructuring 
excluding asset impairments and unusual items and restructuring charges for both periods  our income from operations as a percentage of revenues improved by percentage points 
this improvement in our income from operations as a percentage of revenues is primarily a result of our increased revenue on essentially flat volumes 
we experienced a million increase in our operating expenses from the prior year  but as a percentage of revenue  the measure increased by only percentage points  to  as compared with during the second half of  our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by percentage points when compared with the comparable prior year period 
with the increased prices of fuel and other higher variable operating costs  we believe that these are positive results brought about primarily by our focus on implementing programs to recover our own higher costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses in increased by million  but as a percentage of revenue actually decreased by percentage points to 
we achieved our goal of reducing selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue to below as a result of both our revenue growth and our restructuring to streamline our business 
as a result of higher revenues on relatively flat volumes  our depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by percentage points as compared with the prior period 
although there remains work to be done  we believe our operating margins demonstrate our pricing progress as well as our continued efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations 
outlook for as part of our continuing efforts to improve our operations  we have developed a program to divest under performing and non strategic operations 
in the third quarter of  we identified operations with annual gross revenues of over million for potential divestiture under this program 
we recently announced that we have identified additional assets  representing over million in annual gross revenues  that may also be sold as part of the divestiture program 
while it is too early to assess the financial impact of the divestitures  and whether there may be any material asset impairments as a result of the program  we remain confident that our fix or seek an exit strategy approach to any under performing operations will benefit our financial results in the long term 
additionally  we are continuing our focus on acquisitions and other investments 
we intend to make investments in those locations and lines of businesses that offer superior margins and return on capital 
our company is proud of the accomplishments made in we are focused on building on the momentum that we experienced this year to continue to expand our operating margins  increase our return on invested capital and generate strong cash flows 

table of contents basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following reclassifications have been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year financial information with the current period presentation 
cash balances during  we began making investments in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes  which are debt instruments with long term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates 
through december   we included these investments in cash and cash equivalents 
as a result of guidance issued in early associated with these types of securities  we determined that these investments were more appropriately classified as short term investments  which are a component of current other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
accordingly  in our accompanying consolidated financial statements we have decreased our cash and cash equivalents and increased our current other assets by million at december  gross purchases and sales of these investments are presented within cash flows from investing activities in our statements of cash flows 
additionally  in our and consolidated statements of cash flows  relatively insignificant purchases and sales of other short term investments were included on a net basis within cash flows from investing activities other 
this additional activity is now reflected within purchases and sales of short term investments in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
segments as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of  we eliminated our canadian group office  and the management of our canadian operations was allocated among our eastern  midwest and western groups 
we have allocated the operating results of our canadian operations to the eastern  midwest and western groups for  and the first half of to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our operations 
this reorganization also resulted in the centralization of certain group office functions 
the administrative costs associated with these functions were included in the measurement of income from operations for our reportable segments through august  when the integration of these functions with our existing centralized processes was completed 
beginning in september  these administrative costs have been included in the income from operations of our corporate organization 
the reallocation of these costs has not significantly affected the operating results of our reportable segments for the periods presented 
certain other reclassifications have also been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year information with the current period presentation 
the supplementary financial information included in this section has been updated to reflect these changes 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements  we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses 
we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
the most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills  environmental remediation liabilities  asset impairments and self insurance reserves and recoveries  as described below 
landfills the cost estimates for final capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs  pursuant to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and post closure activities 
because 
table of contents landfill final capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
landfill costs we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity 
this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  landfill gas collection systems  environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas  directly related engineering  capitalized interest  and on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs 
additionally  landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property 
the projection of these landfill costs is dependent  in part  on future events 
the remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs 
final capping costs we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events 
they then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill 
we review these costs annually  or more often if significant facts change 
changes in estimates  such as timing or cost of construction  for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset 
however  as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset  the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense 
closure and post closure costs we base our estimates for closure and post closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post closure maintenance and monitoring 
the estimates for landfill closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain 
available airspace our engineers  in consultation with third party engineering consultants and surveyors  are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills 
the available airspace is determined by an annual survey  which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the final landfill topography 
once the remaining airspace is determined  an airspace utilization factor auf is established to calculate the remaining capacity in tons 
the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement 
the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type  initial and projected waste density  estimated number of years of life remaining  depth of underlying waste  and anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate 
in addition  the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multi level review by our engineering group 
our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements 
expansion airspace we include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances 
first  to include airspace associated with an expansion effort  we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year  and the final expansion permit to be received within five years 
second  we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely  considering the following criteria personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local  state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill  it is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located  
table of contents either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan  there are no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion  financial analysis has been completed  and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact  and airspace and related costs  including additional closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on conceptual design 
these criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
however  our policy provides that  based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill  if these criteria are not met  inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed 
in these circumstances  inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
of the landfill sites with expansions at december   landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace 
thirteen of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because legal  community or other issues could impede the expansion process 
the remaining three landfills required approval primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one or five year requirements  generally due to state specific permitting procedures 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
after determining the costs at our landfills  we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill amortization 
we look at factors such as the waste stream  geography and rate of compaction  among others  to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available  permitted and likely expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities 
we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons  giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill 
we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 
these rates per ton are updated annually  or more often  as significant facts change 
it is possible that actual results  including the amount of costs incurred  the timing of final capping  closure and post closure activities  our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts  could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher final capping  closure or post closure rates  or higher expenses  or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs 
most significantly  if our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset  we may be required to recognize an asset impairment 
if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities under current laws and regulations  we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations  or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site 
remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business 
these costs include potentially responsible party prp investigation  settlement  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation  considering whether we were an owner  operator  transporter  or generator at the site  the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site 
next  we review the same information 
table of contents with respect to other named and unnamed prps 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
internally developed estimates are based on management s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other prps who may be liable for remediation of a specific site  and the typical allocation of costs among prps 
asset impairments our long lived assets  including landfills and landfill expansions  are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
however  accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired 
if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset  we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value 
fair value is determined by either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group or an actual third party valuation 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 
typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if any of these or other indicators occur  we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment 
several of these indicators are beyond our control  and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur 
additionally  estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill  as described below 
landfills certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects 
for example  a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted 
in addition  management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace 
therefore  certain events could occur in the ordinary course of our business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry 

table of contents goodwill at least annually  we assess whether goodwill is impaired 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of our reporting unit s group s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances  such as those listed above  that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired 
self insurance reserves and recoveries we have retained a portion of the risks related to our automobile  general liability and workers compensation insurance programs 
our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data 
our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume 
estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable

table of contents operating revenues our operating revenues in were billion  compared with billion in and billion in we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern  midwest  southern  western  wheelabrator which includes our waste to energy facilities and independent power production plants  or ipps and recycling groups 
these six operating groups are our reportable segments 
shown below in millions is the contribution to revenues during each year from our six operating groups and our other waste services years ended december  eastern midwest southern western wheelabrator recycling other intercompany total our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection  disposal  transfer  wheelabrator and recycling services 
some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance  a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided 
revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees  which are generally based on the weight  volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly 
fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited  taking into account our cost of loading  transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site  and are normally billed monthly 
our wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our waste to energy facilities and ipps and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam 
recycling revenue  which is generated by our recycling group as well as our four geographic operating groups  generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees 
intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions years ended december  collection landfill transfer wheelabrator recycling and other intercompany total

vs 
average yield base business commodity electricity ipps fuel surcharges and fees total volume internal growth acquisitions divestitures foreign currency translation base business in  base business yield improvements were driven by our collection operations  where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating group 
the significant base business yield improvements in the collection line of business are primarily the result of our continued focus on pricing initiatives as a means of increasing our margins  cash flows and return on capital and  to a lesser extent  the adoption of a environmental cost recovery fee  which increased revenues by million during our transfer business in the east and municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the south have also provided significant revenue growth from base business yield improvements throughout the year 
during the second half of  we received substantial yield contributions to revenues from our waste to energy facilities 
these revenue improvements were largely due to significant increases in the rates charged for electricity under our long term contracts with electric utilities 
these rates are generally indexed to natural gas prices  which increased significantly in as a result of hurricane related production disruptions  increased demand and increases in crude oil prices 
the revenue improvements attributable to yield have been partially offset by a general decline in yield in special waste landfill disposal operations  noted principally in our midwest and southern groups 
in  base business yield improvements contributed to increased revenues in our collection  transfer and waste to energy operations 
in our collection business  the most substantial yield improvements during were in our industrial and residential operations  where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements 
although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout was positive  it was affected by increased price competition  particularly in the midwest  and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the south 
the base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout were almost exclusively attributable to the eastern portion of the united states 
base business yield increases during were partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations 
this decline was primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste  particularly in the south and midwest  which was partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal 
commodity our revenues in declined due to price decreases in recycling commodities 
average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by during the year  from per ton in to per ton in average prices for old newsprint were also down by about  from per ton in to per ton in conversely  our revenues in were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process 

table of contents a significant portion of revenues attributable to commodities is rebated to our suppliers of recyclable materials 
accordingly  changes in our revenues due to fluctuations in commodity prices have a corresponding impact on our cost of goods sold 
fuel surcharges and fees fuel surcharges increased revenues year over year by million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges 
the substantial current year increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be attributed to i increases in market prices for fuel  ii an increase in the number of customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program  and iii the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter of to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors 
during the year ended december   increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices  which are included within both operating expenses subcontractor costs and operating expenses fuel  were substantially recovered by our fuel surcharge program 
volume volume related revenues are relatively flat when comparing with this is generally because of the combined impacts of i a decline in revenues associated with hurricanes  ii increases in recycling and landfill disposal volumes  and iii lower revenue from residential  commercial and industrial collection volumes  particularly in the east and midwest  which can generally be attributed to our focus on improving our margins by increasing yield 
our volume related revenues generated from hurricane related services were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the million decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain of our operations in the gulf coast region during as a result of the severe destruction caused by hurricane katrina 
in addition  much of our hurricane related revenues were associated with subcontracted services  which generated comparatively lower margins 
in  we generally elected not to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not support the required services with internal resources 
when excluding the impacts of the hurricanes  revenue due to volume increased million  or during current year volume related revenue increases have largely been due to i increased recycling volumes provided by several new brokerage contracts  ii increased landfill disposal volumes in the midwest  west and south  iii increased transfer station volumes in the west and the south  and iv increased residential collection volumes in the west 
also included as a component of volume related revenue growth is revenue generated from our construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a municipality in our midwest group 
the revenue generated by this project was low margin and largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold 
these revenue increases were largely offset by volume declines experienced in each line of business in the eastern portion of the united states and significant volume declines in our collection business in the midwest 
we believe volume declines in our collection and transfer businesses in the east and midwest can generally be attributed to our focus on improving base business yield and the price competition typical in these regions 
during  we experienced significant volume related revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses 
a substantial portion of volume related revenue growth was due to the volume increases experienced in industrial collection operations for each of our operating groups 
in the southern and western portions of the united states  our residential collection  transfer  construction and demolition disposal and special waste landfill disposal operations also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout acquisitions and divestitures during the year ended december   acquisitions contributed million of additional revenues offset by a decline in revenue of million during the year as a result of divestitures 
we expect the decrease in revenues attributable to divestitures to increase in future periods as a result of our plan to divest under performing or non strategic operations 
in  the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from allied waste industries  inc in the third and fourth quarters of other acquisitions of recycling  transfer and waste to energy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of also provided increases in revenues during 
table of contents operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below  which include salaries and wages  related payroll taxes  insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor  ii transfer and disposal costs  which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations  iii maintenance and repairs relating to equipment  vehicles and facilities and related labor costs  iv subcontractor costs  which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities  v costs of goods sold  which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities  vi fuel costs  which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment  vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes  which include landfill taxes  municipal franchise fees  host community fees and royalties  viii landfill operating costs  which include landfill remediation costs  leachate and methane collection and treatment  other landfill site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement obligations  ix risk management costs  which include workers compensation and insurance and claim costs and x other operating costs  which include  among other costs  equipment and facility rent and property taxes 
the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses  including the impact of foreign currency translation  for the year ended december for the respective periods in millions period to period period to period change change labor and related benefits transfer and disposal costs maintenance and repairs subcontractor costs cost of goods sold fuel disposal and franchise fees and taxes landfill operating costs risk management other labor and related benefits when comparing with  these costs have increased due to i salary and wage increases as a result of annual merit increases  ii a general increase in employee health care and benefit costs  iii an increase in the costs attributable to contract labor used at our material recovery facilities due to acquisitions  and iv increased payroll taxes 
in  the year over year increase in costs was generally due to higher salary costs and higher hourly wage and overtime costs 
for purposes of the above disclosure  the presentation of prior years has been conformed to our current year presentation that excludes labor costs related to fleet and container maintenance facilities as well as workers compensation costs 
labor costs attributable principally to our fleet and container maintenance facilities of million for and million for have been reclassified as a component of the caption maintenance and repairs  and workers compensation costs of million for and million for have been included as a component of the caption risk management 
transfer and disposal costs in  the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at third party transfer stations or landfills declined due to our focus on improving internalization 
these costs significantly increased in as compared with due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions 
maintenance and repairs increases in these costs are attributable to i higher parts and supplies costs  which were driven by changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our waste to energy facilities and 
table of contents increased volumes in our southern and western groups  ii increases in the cost of lubes and oils  and iii increases in the labor costs associated with our maintenance and repairs 
subcontractor costs throughout and we have experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices  which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to third party subcontractors 
subcontractor cost increases attributable to higher fuel costs were significantly offset by the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program  which is reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues 
additionally  in we incurred additional transportation costs due to increased volumes in subcontracted work  particularly in our national accounts organization and western group 
the current year cost increases were partially offset by a year over year decline in the utilization of subcontractors to assist in providing hurricane related services 
in addition to the significant increase in subcontractor costs related to hurricane related services during  we also experienced increases due to i the impact of acquisitions  ii increased third party transportation costs in our western group due to the service requirements of certain event work  and iii additional transportation costs in our eastern group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills 
cost of goods sold these costs are primarily for rebates paid to our suppliers  which are driven by the market prices of recyclable commodities 
in  we experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities than in prior years 
this decrease in pricing was more than offset by increased recycling volumes in due to several new brokerage contracts and recent acquisitions 
in  the increase in cost of goods sold was also partially due to costs incurred to construct an integrated waste facility for a municipality in the midwest group 
the increase in over is directly related to the year over year increase in market prices of recyclable commodities 
fuel we experienced an average increase of per gallon for as compared with and in we experienced an average increase of per gallon for over while we recover a significant portion of the cost increases incurred as a result of higher fuel prices through our fuel surcharge program  increased fuel costs continue to negatively affect our operating margins 
revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel yield increases within operating revenues 
disposal and franchise fees and taxes these cost increases are the result of increased volumes and increased rates for mandated fees and taxes 
certain of these cost increases are passed through to our customers  and have been reflected as fee yield increases within operating revenues 
landfill operating costs these cost increases have generally been related to higher site maintenance  leachate collection  monitoring and testing  and closure and post closure expenses 
risk management over the last two years  we have been successful in maintaining these costs at a consistent level largely due to reduced workers compensation costs  which can partially be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates 
other operating expenses the increase in these costs since can be attributed to i hurricane katrina related support costs  particularly in louisiana  where we built camp waste management to house and feed hundreds of our employees who worked in the new orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts  ii a year over year decrease in the realization of gains on sales of assets  iii costs incurred during attributable to labor strikes in new jersey and canada  and iv an increase in costs generated by a surety bonding company we have consolidated since the third quarter of under the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the primary reason for the decrease during as compared with is the december  consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities  from which we lease three waste to energy facilities 
the consolidation of these entities is as a result of our fin implementation 
prior to the consolidation of these entities  we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases 
the consolidation of these entities  therefore  resulted in a decline in rental expense in  which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation  interest expense and minority interest expense 

table of contents selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs  which include salaries  related insurance and benefits  contract labor  payroll taxes and equity based compensation  ii professional fees  which include fees for consulting  legal  audit and tax services  iii provision for bad debts  which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees  and iv other general and administrative expenses  which include  among other costs  facility related expenses  voice and data telecommunications  advertising  travel and entertainment  rentals  postage and printing 
the following table summarizes the major components of our selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december for the respective periods in millions period to period period to period change change labor and related benefits professional fees provision for bad debts other labor and related benefits throughout we experienced increases in i non cash compensation costs associated with recent changes in equity based compensation provided for by our long term incentive plan and ii group insurance costs largely due to general health care cost increases 
in both and  these costs increased year over year due to higher salaries and hourly wages driven by annual merit raises as well as higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance on a year over year basis 
also contributing to the increase in labor costs in when compared with was an increase in commissions paid to our sales personnel 
declines in our use of contract labor  particularly for corporate support functions  partially offset these cost increases for both and additionally  during the second half of we began to realize the benefits of our july reorganization  which simplified our management structure to increase the accountability and responsibility of our market areas 
our ability to streamline our organization in this manner can be attributed to our continued focus on creating efficiencies with our key personnel 
our and restructurings have been a result of identifying the most effective utilization of our resources  and are discussed in the restructuring section below 
professional fees in  we experienced an increase in professional fees as a result of higher litigation and defense costs as well as consulting fees that were largely due to our implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of the decline in our litigation and defense costs in the current year is due to several cases winding down and either being settled or moving into the settlement stages 
consulting costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance have also decreased as we move from the implementation phase to continued monitoring and testing 
in  an increase in consulting fees related to our pricing initiatives and an increase in our computer support costs have partially offset these reductions 
provision for bad debts as a percentage of revenue  these costs have continued to decline largely due to improved collection efforts 
the increase in these costs in was generally attributable to a year over year increase in third party collection costs 
other selling  general and administrative costs although we did not see a significant fluctuation in these costs when comparing with  increased sales and marketing costs related to our national advertising campaign did result in a notable increase in these expenses in the current year 
the recognition of favorable settlements for legal disputes during drove the increase in these costs from to depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation of property and equipment  including assets recorded due to capital leases  on a straight line basis from three to years  ii amortization of landfill costs  
table of contents including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development  construction  closure and post closure  on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site  iii amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event  and iv amortization of intangible assets with a definite life  either using a declining balance approach or a straight line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements  which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million during the year ended december  this increase is largely attributable to a million charge to landfill amortization recorded to adjust the amortization periods of nine of our landfills 
these adjustments reflect cumulative corrections resulting from reducing the amortization periods of the landfills and were necessary to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations 
we determined that the impact of these adjustments was not material to or prior periods results of operations 
our landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization also increased when compared with as a result of the comparative impact of landfill amortization reductions recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
during the years ended december  and  landfill amortization expense was reduced by million and million  respectively  with the majority of the reduced expense resulting from revised estimates associated with final capping changes 
similar adjustments did not significantly affect our landfill amortization expense in depreciation and amortization expense increased by million during the year ended december  as compared with the increase in depreciation and amortization in was primarily related to i an increase in our landfill amortization rate  net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs  of per ton  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes  ii increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprise wide software systems into service during the latter half of  and iii increased depreciation expense for our wheelabrator group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities 
restructuring management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure 
these reviews have highlighted efficiencies and cost savings we could capture by restructuring 
the most significant cost savings we have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following summarizes the organizational changes that have occurred during the last three years to reach our current structure 
in february  we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization 
as a result  we incurred million in one time employee severance and benefit costs 
the operational efficiencies provided by the february organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in june we recorded an additional million of pre tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during in  we recorded a million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with the workforce reductions 
during the third quarter of  we reorganized and simplified our organizational structure by eliminating certain support functions performed at the group or corporate office 
we also eliminated the canadian group office  which reduced the number of our operating groups from seven to six 
this reorganization has reduced costs at the group and corporate offices and increased the accountability of our market areas 
we recorded million of pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure  principally for employee severance and benefit costs 

table of contents asset impairments and unusual items the following table summarizes the major components of asset impairments and unusual items for the year ended december for the respective periods in millions years ended december  asset impairments net gains on divestitures other the significant transactions and events resulting in asset impairments  net gains on divestitures and other financial statement impacts within asset impairments and unusual items in our consolidated statements of operations during the three years ended december  are discussed below year ended december  asset impairments during the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the pottstown landfill located in west pottsgrove township  pennsylvania 
we determined that an impairment was necessary after the pennsylvania environmental hearing board upheld a denial by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection of a permit application for a vertical expansion at the landfill 
after the denial was upheld  the company reviewed the options available at the pottstown landfill and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options 
after such evaluation and considering the length of time required for the appeal process and the permit application review  we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial 
this decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the permitting delays  which would hinder our ability to fully utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill s required closure in we continued to operate the pottstown landfill using existing permitted airspace through the landfill s permit expiration date of october the pottstown landfill had not been a significant contributor to our recent earnings nor do we expect the expansion denial to have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows 
through june   our property and equipment had included approximately million of accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system 
approximately million of these costs were specifically associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use  while the remaining costs were associated with the general efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our existing applications and hardware 
the development efforts associated with our revenue management system were suspended in since that time  there have been changes in the viable software alternatives available to address our current needs 
during the third quarter of  we concluded our assessment of potential revenue management system options 
as a result  we entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the license  implementation and maintenance of certain of its applications software  including waste and recycling functionality 
we believe that these newly licensed applications  when fully implemented  will provide substantially better capabilities and functionality than the software we were developing 
our plan to implement this newly licensed software resulted in a million charge in the third quarter of for the software that had been under development and capitalized costs associated with the development efforts specific to that software 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an million charge for asset impairments 
this charge was primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our eastern group  as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions  and the impairment of capitalized software costs related to two applications we decided not to develop further 
net gains on divestitures during the first quarter of  we recognized a million gain as a result of the divestiture of a landfill in ontario  canada  which was required as a result of a divestiture order from the canadian competition bureau 
during the remainder of  we recognized a total of million in 
table of contents gains as a result of the divestiture of operations 
with the exception of our divestiture of the ontario  canada landfill  our divestitures during were generally part of our plan to review under performing or non strategic operations and to either improve their performance or dispose of the operations 
total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended december  were million  of which million was received in cash  million was in the form of a note receivable and million was in the form of non monetary assets 
we do not believe that these divestitures are material either individually or in the aggregate and we do not expect these divestitures to materially affect our consolidated financial position or future results of operations or cash flows 
other during the first quarter of  we recognized a charge of approximately million for the impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of stockholders that opted not to participate in the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to and activity 
during the third quarter of  we settled our ongoing defense costs and any future indemnity obligations for four former officers of wm holdings related to legacy litigation brought by the sec against such former officers 
as a result  we recorded a million charge for the funding of the court ordered distribution to our shareholders for the former officers settlement of the litigation 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  this settlement agreement resulted in a distribution of million to wmi shareholders of record as of august  these charges were partially offset by the recognition of a million net benefit recorded during the year ended december   which was primarily for adjustments to our receivables and estimated obligations for non solid waste operations divested in and year ended december  for  the significant items included within asset impairments and unusual items were i million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs  ii million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain port o let operations  and iii million in miscellaneous net gains  which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated obligations associated with non solid waste services  which were divested in and year ended december  for  the significant items included within asset impairments and unusual items were million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to divested operations in the western group 
income from operations by reportable segment the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended december for each respective period and provides explanations of factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments operating results in millions period to period period to period change change eastern midwest southern western wheelabrator recycling other corporate total 
table of contents eastern operating income was relatively flat when comparing with current year operating income has been favorably affected by base business yield improvement  particularly in the collection and transfer lines of business and recent tuck in acquisitions 
these operational improvements were offset by i the recognition of a net charge of million to asset impairments and unusual items  which was driven by the impairment of the pottstown landfill  and ii additional operating costs of million attributable to a seven week labor strike in new jersey in the first quarter of in addition  our focus on improving base business yield has resulted in partially offsetting volume declines during  which reflects the competitive nature of the region and our decision to concentrate on higher margin revenues 
the improvement in operating income from to was driven primarily by i revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business  partially offset by volume declines in transfer  residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year  ii higher operating expenses incurred in as compared with due to the first quarter s harsh weather conditions  and iii acquisitions 
these earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste  higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill 
midwest the current year increase in income from operations was primarily due to revenue growth associated with increased base business yield for the collection line of business  which was driven principally by residential collection operations 
also positively affecting results compared with the prior year was a decline in landfill amortization expense generally as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
however  our focus on improving base business yield has resulted in partially offsetting volume declines during operating income between and was relatively flat 
the slight increase in operating income in can largely be attributed to higher operating expenses incurred in the first quarter of due to harsh winter weather conditions 
southern strong internal revenue growth contributed significantly to the increase in income from operations during the most significant revenue growth was associated with base business yield improvements in the collection line of business and volume related revenue growth in the transfer and landfill disposal lines of business 
in addition  million of the increase in income from operations was attributable to gains recognized on the divestiture of operations during these increases were partially offset by i a decline in earnings related to hurricanes  largely due to the temporary suspension of operations in the areas affected by hurricane katrina  ii the effects of higher landfill amortization costs  generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations  iii higher landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping  closure and post closure obligations  and iv increases in salaries and wages 
operating income in was favorably affected by i positive internal revenue growth  largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations  ii acquisitions  iii increased revenue during the second half of as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter  iv favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of  largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout  and v various operating and administrative cost reductions 
these improvements were partially offset by a charge to asset impairments and unusual items for the write off of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of western the significant increase in income from operations in can partially be attributed to internal revenue growth  which was driven by yield improvements in commercial and industrial collection operations and volume growth in residential collection and transfer operations 
in addition  during  we recognized million of gains associated with the divestiture of operations  an increase of approximately million from these earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs  particularly for labor and related benefits 
the increase in operating income between and was primarily attributable to revenue growth  which was largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and 
table of contents average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations 
these gains were partially offset by i increased labor costs  ii higher fuel costs not passed on to customers  and iii increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs 
wheelabrator the electric rates we charge to our customers at our waste to energy facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of as a result of higher market prices for natural gas  which increased significantly as a result of hurricane related production disruptions  increased demand and increases in crude oil prices 
this increase in rates was the principal reason for the current year increase in wheelabrator s income from operations 
the favorable impact of market prices for natural gas was partially offset by higher costs of goods sold and higher repair and maintenance costs due to the scope and timing of work performed in as compared with the increase in operating income was due in large part to i positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on long term disposal contracts and ii the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december   which increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs  partially offset by increases in depreciation expense the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense 
wheelabrator s operating results were favorably affected by an million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement  which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented 
recycling the decrease in income from operations in our recycling group during when compared with the prior year can generally be attributed to i an increase in the rebates paid to our suppliers as a result of increased competition  ii costs related to the deployment of new software  and iii higher subcontractor costs primarily related to increased distances traveled by third party truckers 
the comparability of operating results for the recycling group for all of the periods presented above has been affected by variances in the market prices for recyclable commodities 
during the three years ended december   year over year changes in the quarterly average market prices of occ and onp have ranged from a decrease of as much as to an increase of as much as 
in  our operating revenues were favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for these commodities 
improvements in the market prices for recycable commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers 
other the increase in income from operations from prior years is due to a pre tax gain of million resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in ontario  canada during the first quarter of this impact is included in asset impairments and unusual items within our consolidated statement of operations 
as this landfill had been divested at the time of our reorganization  historical financial information associated with its operations has not been allocated to our remaining reportable segments 
accordingly  these impacts have been included in other 
partially offsetting this gain are certain year end adjustments related to the reportable segments that are not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed 
corporate the higher expenses in the current year were driven primarily by impairment charges of million associated with capitalized software costs and million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters 
these items are discussed in the asset impairments and unusual items section above 
also contributing to the increase in expenses during were i an increase in non cash employee compensation costs associated with current year changes in equity based compensation  ii increases in employee health care costs  iii salary and wage increases attributable to annual merit raises  iv increased sales and marketing costs attributed to a national advertising campaign and consulting fees related to our pricing initiatives  and v costs at corporate associated with our july restructuring charge and organizational changes  which were partially offset by associated savings at corporate 
higher professional fees contributed to the increase in expenses as compared with 
table of contents other components of income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles the following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december for each respective period in millions period to period to period change period change interest expense  net equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities minority interest other  net provision for benefit from income taxes percentage change not meaningful 
refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased by million from to due to a million increase in interest expense and a million decline in interest income 
the increase in interest expense in is generally related to a decline in the benefit of our interest rate swaps 
for all periods  we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts  which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in net interest expense reductions of million for  million for and million for the significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our interest rate swap agreements in is largely attributable to the increase in short term market interest rates 
our periodic interest obligations under our interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from the three month libor  which has increased from at december  to at december  included in the million in net reductions to interest expense realized in for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is million related to the amortization of terminated swaps 
our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by million in  million in and million in the current year decrease in interest income is due primarily to interest income of million realized during on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits 
the comparability of net interest expense for and was also significantly affected by this increase in interest income in equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities in the first and second quarters of  we acquired an equity interest in two coal based synthetic fuel production facilities 
our equity interest in these facilities drives our equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 
the year over year increase in these losses is due to the timing of our initial investments in these equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for income taxes 
if  for any reason  the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under section of the internal revenue code  we could unwind the related investment in the period that determination is made and not incur these equity losses in future periods 
additional information related to these investments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest on december   we consolidated two special purpose type variable interest entities as a result of our implementation of fin our minority interest expense for and is primarily related to the 
table of contents other members equity interest in the earnings of these entities 
the increase in minority interest expense as a result of the consolidation of these entities has been more than offset by related increases in our consolidated income from operations 
the increase in minority interest expense in when compared with was largely due to the improved operating results of the surety bonding company that we began consolidating in additional information related to these investments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other  net our other income and expense is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation on our canadian operations 
provision for income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in compared to a provision for income taxes of million for and million for for both and  the effective income tax rates of and  respectively  are significantly less than the effective income tax rate of partially due to the resolution of significant tax audits within those years 
the settlement of tax audits resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of million in  million in and million in excluding the impact of tax audit settlements  the effective tax rate for and would be and 
for and  the decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate from is also attributable to our investments in two coal based synthetic fuel production facilities that we obtained in the first half of the decrease in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in these coal based synthetic fuel production facilities of million in and million in more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities 
these tax credits  as well as our non conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills  are available through pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  but may be phased out if the price of oil exceeds a threshold annual average price determined by the irs 
for all periods  a portion of the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes is due to state and local income taxes 
in  we reduced our estimated effective state tax rate  causing us to realize a benefit of million related to the reduction of accumulated deferred taxes that was offset in part by additional income tax expense of million to increase the accrued deferred tax as a result of a change in the provincial tax rate in quebec 
in  our overall tax benefit has been partially offset by the accrual of million of taxes associated with our repatriation of million of accumulated earnings and capital from certain of our canadian subsidiaries under the american jobs creation act of  which is discussed further within the liquidity and capital resources section below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles on march   we recorded a credit of million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by fin see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in the first and fourth quarters of  we recorded net of tax charges of million and million  respectively  to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below 
through december   we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste to energy facilities and independent power production plants 
effective january   we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred 
we recorded million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 

table of contents through december   we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues 
effective january   we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as incurred 
we recorded million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded million  including tax benefit  or per diluted share  in the first quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping  closure and post closure costs 
in connection with the application of fin to special purpose type variable interest entities  we recorded million  including tax benefit  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
for a discussion of these variable interest entities see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources general as an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs  our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations 
however  we operate in a capital intensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive 
based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives  we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future 
these factors include the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base  our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment  our liquidity profile  our asset base  and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation 
we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows  our liquidity and our capital resources  enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities 
in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations  we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills  ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet  iii refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy and materials recovery facilities  iv the container and equipment needs of our operations  and v capping  closure and post closure activities at our landfills 
we are also committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for up to billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during  and we also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act became law 
a provision of the act allowed us companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during our chief executive officer and board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated million of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in the repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings

table of contents summary of cash  short term investments  restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations the following is a summary of our cash  short term investments available for use  restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december  and december  in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments available for use total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available for use restricted trust and escrow accounts tax exempt bond funds closure  post closure and remediation funds debt service funds other total restricted trust and escrow accounts debt current portion long term portion total debt increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit  certificates of deposit  money market accounts  and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
for discussion regarding the december  reclassification of cash  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements and the basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information section above 
short term investments available for use these investments include auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes  which are debt instruments with long term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates 
the interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic marketing of the underlying securities through an auction process 
due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the short term nature of our investment in these securities  they have been classified as current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
restricted trust and escrow accounts restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations  funds deposited in connection with landfill closure  post closure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits 
these balances are primarily included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets

table of contents debt revolving credit and letter of credit facilities the table below summarizes the credit capacity  maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility  principal letter of credit facilities and other credit arrangements as of december  in millions outstanding total credit letters of facility capacity maturity credit five year revolving credit facility a  october  five year letter of credit and term loan agreement b june five year letter of credit facility b december seven year letter of credit and term loan agreement b june ten year letter of credit and term loan agreement b june other c various total a this facility provides us with credit capacity that could be used for either cash borrowings or letters of credit 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility  and we had unused and available credit capacity of million 
b these facilities have been established to provide us with letter of credit capacity 
in the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit  the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining term under the respective agreement or facility 
through december  we had not experienced any unreimbursed draws on our letters of credit 
c we have letters of credit outstanding under various arrangements that do not provide for a committed capacity 
accordingly  the total credit capacity of these arrangements has been noted as zero 
we have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs  certain tax exempt bond issuances  municipal and governmental waste management contracts  closure and post closure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits 
these facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit 
we expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future  and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs 
canadian credit facility in november  waste management of canada corporation  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  entered into a three year credit facility agreement 
the agreement was entered into to facilitate wmi s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its canadian subsidiaries as discussed above 
the agreement  which matures november   allowed waste management of canada corporation to borrow up to canadian million at any time on or before december  any unused portion of the available credit was subject to immediate cancellation 
as of december   the entire credit capacity of the facility had been advanced resulting in proceeds of us million 
the advances do not accrue interest during their terms 
accordingly  the proceeds we received were for the principal amount of us million net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the advance 
the advances have a weighted average effective interest rate of and mature either three months or twelve months from the date of issuance 
however  the terms of the credit facility allow waste management of canada corporation to elect to renew the advances 
as of december   we expect to repay us million of outstanding advances with available cash and renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility 
accordingly  million of debt associated with these borrowings is classified as current in our december  consolidated balance sheet and the remaining borrowings have been classified as long term 
senior notes as of december   we had billion of outstanding senior notes 
the notes have various maturities ranging from october to may  and interest rates ranging from to 
on may   million of senior notes and million of senior notes matured and were repaid with cash on hand 
we have million of senior notes that mature in october that we currently expect to repay with available cash 

table of contents tax exempt bonds we actively issue tax exempt bonds as a means of accessing low cost financing for capital expenditures 
as of december   we had billion of outstanding tax exempt bonds 
we issued million of tax exempt bonds during the proceeds from these debt issuances were deposited directly into a trust fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised  which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services 
accordingly  the restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not been included in new borrowings in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  as we spend monies on the specific projects being financed  we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds 
as discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above  we have million held in trust for future spending as of december  during  we received million from these funds for approved capital expenditures 
as of december   million of our tax exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield 
if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds  then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us 
these bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our billion  five year revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us 
accordingly  these obligations have been classified as long term in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  we have million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months  which is prior to their scheduled maturities 
if the re offering of the bonds is unsuccessful  then the bonds can be put to us  requiring immediate repayment 
these bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re offering and are  therefore  considered a current obligation 
however  these bonds have been classified as long term in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the classification of these obligations as long term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long term financings in the event of a failed re offering and our ability  in the event other sources of long term financing are not available  to use our five year revolving credit facility 
tax exempt project bonds as of december   we had million of outstanding tax exempt project bonds 
these debt instruments are primarily used by our wheelabrator group to finance the development of waste to energy facilities 
the bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments 
as of december  million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield 
if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds  then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us 
repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our five year revolving credit facility 
accordingly  these obligations have been classified as long term in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
approximately million of our tax exempt project bonds will be repaid with available cash within the next twelve months 
convertible subordinated notes we had million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid  with cash on hand  upon maturity on january  interest rate swaps we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt 
as of december   the interest payments on billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates  allowing us to maintain approximately of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately at variable interest rates 
fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by million as of december  and million at december  
table of contents summary of cash flow activity the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december for each respective period in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities we generated  million in cash flows from our operating activities during the year ended december  compared with  million in  an increase of million 
in general  our current year operating cash flow was favorably affected by growth in our operating income and comparative changes in our trade and other receivables 
as of december   our trade receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  have increased million from december  compared with a million increase in trade receivables during the increase in our receivables in both periods was primarily related to increased revenues  however  the significant change year over year can partially be attributed to receivable balances associated with significant revenues generated from hurricane related services provided in the second half of the relative change in our receivables can also be attributed to overall improvements in our collection efforts  which have contributed to a reduction in our days sales outstanding 
our and income taxes have been significantly affected by tax audit settlements 
the increases in our net income associated with these tax benefits resulted in offsetting reductions in our accrued liability balances 
therefore  the significant variances in our income taxes during  and have had an insignificant impact on each respective period s cash flows from operations 
cash generated from operations during was negatively affected by a million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit  which was agreed to in this amount included i a final net cash settlement payment  net of insurance proceeds of million plus accrued interest  ii a total tax benefit of approximately million and iii related net settlement recoveries of approximately million 
this net cash outflow was partially offset by million of cash we received from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities 
after adjusting for the unusual items mentioned above  our cash flows from operations increased million over our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships were the primary contributors of this increase 
net cash used in investing activities we used  million of our cash resources for investing activities during  an increase of million as compared with this increase is primarily due to a million change in net cash flows associated with purchases and sales of short term investments 
net purchases of short term investments during were million compared with net purchases of million during we increased our utilization of short term investments in the first quarter of  which resulted in this activity being relatively insignificant in the increase in our short term investments available for use as of december  can generally be attributed to an increase in our available cash  which we plan to use to fund  among other things  a million accelerated share repurchase agreement that became effective in january and our first quarter dividend that will be paid in march our share repurchases and dividends are discussed in our net cash used in financing activities section below 
the current year increase in net cash outflows from investing activities as a result of our short term investments was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets  which were million in  million in and million in the million increase from to is largely attributable to the sale of one of our landfills in ontario  canada  as required by a divestiture order from the canadian competition tribunal 
as we continue to focus on our plan to divest of 
table of contents certain under performing and non strategic operations  we expect proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales to make even greater contributions to our cash flows 
our cash used for capital expenditures and acquisition spending has also caused significant changes in our net cash used for investing activities for the three year period 
due to the capital intensive nature of our business  we have invested between billion and billion in property and equipment during each of the last three years 
capital expenditures for were  million  which is million and million less than we invested in capital in and  respectively 
cash used for acquisitions was million in  million in and million in in recent years  our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuck in acquisitions  which are relatively small  accretive businesses that will easily integrate with  and provide value to  our existing operations 
however  our acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuck in acquisitions  particularly in our recycling line of business 
our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets  which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins 
net cash used in financing activities the most significant changes in our financing cash flows during the three years ended december  are related to i variances in our net debt repayments  which can generally be attributed to scheduled maturities  ii increases in our dividend payments  and iii changes in cash paid for our repurchases of common stock 
cash paid for these financing activities are discussed below 
net debt repayments were million in  million in and million in the following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year we received million for new borrowings during the year  primarily related to our canadian credit facility that was entered into to facilitate wmi s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its canadian subsidiaries 
the terms of these borrowings are discussed above 
we also repaid million of debt  including million of senior notes  million of tax exempt project bonds  million of convertible subordinated notes and million associated with capital leases and other debt 
we received proceeds of approximately million from the march issuance of million of senior notes  repaid million of senior notes that matured in april  million of senior notes that matured in may and million of senior notes that matured in october in addition  we borrowed million  which was primarily for a short term note that was repaid in  and repaid million of tax exempt bonds and million of tax exempt project bonds and made million of payments for capital leases and other debt 
our borrowings were primarily related to tax exempt bonds and other debt 
we repaid million of senior notes that matured in december  million of tax exempt project bonds and million of capital lease obligations and other debt 
in august  our board of directors approved our quarterly dividend program  which began in the first quarter of under this program  we declared and paid a dividend of per share in each quarter of and of per share in each quarter of the payment of our quarterly dividends resulted in cash dividends of million in and million in before this program was implemented  we paid an annual per share dividend  which resulted in a million dividend payment in in october  the board of directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be per share 
on december   the board declared our first quarterly dividend for of per share  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors  and depend on various factors  including our net earnings  financial condition  cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant 
we paid million for share repurchases in as compared with million paid during and million paid in our stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a board approved capital allocation program providing for the authorization of up to billion for these activities 
table of contents during each of  and since the inception of our repurchase program in february  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately billion 
we currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above  and in january repurchased approximately million shares for million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement 
future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management  and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the board in making dividend declarations 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions thereafter total recorded obligations expected environmental liabilities a final capping  closure and post closure environmental remediation debt payments b  c  d cash dividend payment e unrecorded obligations f non cancelable operating lease obligations estimated unconditional purchase obligations g anticipated liquidity impact as of december  a environmental liabilities include final capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
the amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  without the impact of discounting and inflation 
our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills 
b our debt obligations as of december  include million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds subject to re pricing within the next twelve months  which is prior to their scheduled maturities 
if the re offering of the bonds is unsuccessful  then the bonds can be put to us  requiring immediate repayment 
these bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re offering and are  therefore  considered a current obligation 
however  these bonds have been classified as long term in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the classification of these obligations as long term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long term financings in the event of a failed re offering and our ability  in the event other sources of long term financing are not available  to use our billion  five year revolving credit facility 
c we have classified approximately million of our debt obligations with contractual maturities on or before december  as long term in our consolidated balance sheet at december  because we have the intent and ability to refinance these obligations with long term debt instruments 
d our recorded debt obligations include non cash adjustments associated with discounts  premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities 
these amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods 
in addition  million of our future debt payments and related interest obligations will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as other assets within our december  consolidated balance sheet 
e on december   we declared our first quarterly cash dividend for the dividend is per share and is payable march  to stockholders of record on march  based on shares outstanding on december   the dividend declaration will result in a payment of million 
our dividend declarations are under a board of directors approved capital allocation program that provides for up to billion for stock repurchases and dividend payments in  and all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board and depend on various factors  including our net earnings  financial condition  cash required for future prospects and other relevant factors 
f our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods 
we have also made certain guarantees  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
g our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business 
certain of our obligations are quantity driven 
for these contracts  we have estimated our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations 

table of contents we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely 
as a result  the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
our third party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december  nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
seasonal trends and inflation our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months  primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste 
the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months 
our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 
additionally  certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected 
however  for several reasons  including significant start up costs  such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins 
certain weather conditions may actually result in the temporary suspension of our operations  which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions 
the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months  when electrical demand is generally lower  to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste to energy facilities 
while inflationary increases in costs  including the cost of fuel  have affected our operating margins in recent periods  we believe that inflation generally has not had  and in the near future is not expected to have  any material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  management s estimates associated with inflation have had  and will continue to have  an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements through december   we accounted for equity based compensation in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended 
under apb no 
 companies were required to recognize compensation expense based on the intrinsic value of the award at the date of grant 
for stock options  which were the primary form of awards we granted through december   this meant that we recognized no compensation expense in connection with the grants  as the exercise price of the options was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of share based payments on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   which is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive plans  effective december  the decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the non cash compensation expense that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
we estimate that the acceleration eliminated approximately million of pre tax compensation charges that would have been recognized over the next three years as the stock options continued to vest 
we recognized a million pre tax charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of as a result of the acceleration  but will not be required to recognize future compensation 
table of contents expense for the accelerated options under sfas no 
r unless further modifications are made to the options  which is not anticipated 
additionally  as a result of the changes in accounting under sfas no 
r and a desire to design our long term incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to operating and market performance  our board of directors approved a substantial change in the form of awards that we grant 
beginning in  annual stock options grants  as well as stock option grants in connection with new hires and promotions  were replaced with either i grants of restricted stock units and performance share units or ii an enhanced cash incentive compensation award 
the restricted stock units granted in vest over four years and the performance share units cliff vest based on the achievement of certain performance targets after a three year performance period 
using apb no 
 we generally have recognized compensation expense for these awards over their respective vesting periods 
compensation expense included in reported net income associated with restricted stock shares of which were granted to a limited number of employees in each of the last three years  restricted stock units and performance share units was million  or million net of tax  for the year ended december  the amount of compensation expense recognized would not have been significantly different had we accounted for them under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
as a result of our board of directors decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding options and replace stock options with restricted stock units and performance share units  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to significantly affect our accounting for equity based compensation since the resulting compensation expense for our new share based payment awards is not significantly different than under apb no 
however  we do expect compensation expense to increase over the next three to four years because of the incremental expense that will be recognized each year as our board of directors grants additional awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices 
from time to time  we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
as of december   all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by our derivative counterparties 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
these analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations  which are primarily denominated in us dollars 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations  which directly impacts variability in interest costs 
an instantaneous  one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately million at december  and million at december  this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings  nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have million and million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of long term other assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure  post closure and remedial activities at our disposal 
table of contents facilities and are  therefore  invested in high quality  liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities 
because of the short terms to maturity of these investments  we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 
currency rate exposure 
from time to time  we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany canadian currency denominated debt transactions 
at december  and we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding 
commodities price exposure 
we market recycled products such as wastepaper  aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities 
we enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales 
under the swap agreements  we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time 
with regard to our option agreements  we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors put options and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings call options 
additionally  we have entered into collars combination of a put and call option with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling 
we record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings  as required 
all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy  which governs the type of instruments that may be used 
the fair value position of our commodity derivatives would decrease by approximately million at december  and by approximately million at december  if there were an instantaneous increase across all commodities and applicable yield curves 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments
