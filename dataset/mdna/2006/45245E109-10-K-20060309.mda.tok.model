item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d critical accounting policies cont d revenue recognition cont d sales and sales type leases of theater systems cont d the company monitors the performance of the theaters to which it has leased equipment 
when facts and circumstances indicate that it may need to change the terms of a lease  which had previously been recorded as a sales type lease  the company evaluates the likely outcome of such negotiations using the criteria under fas a provision is recorded against the net investment in leases if the company believes that it is probable that the negotiation will result in a reduction in the minimum lease payments such that the lease will be reclassified as an operating lease 
the provision is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the net investment in lease over the fair value of the equipment 
any adjustments which result from a change in classification from a sales type lease to an operating lease are reported as a charge to income during the period the change occurs 
in the normal course of its business  the company will from time to time determine that a provision it had previously taken against the net investment in leases in connection with a customer s lease agreement should be reversed due to a change in the circumstances that led to the original provision 
the company generally enters into multi year system lease agreements with customers that typically contain customer payment obligations prior to the scheduled installation of the system 
during the period of time between lease signing and system installation  certain customers each year generally are unable  or elect not  to proceed with system installation for a number of reasons including business considerations  or the inability to obtain certain consents  approvals or financing 
once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation  the customer and the company may enter into a consensual lease buyout  whereby the parties are released from all their future obligations under the lease and the geographic territory granted to the customer reverts to the company 
once an agreement is reached by both parties  the initial lease payments that the customer previously made to the company are typically recognized as revenue 
for this reason  the company has a high degree of certainty of collecting a substantial value of a signed contract  either through the installation of a theater system or a consensual lease buyout 
in addition  since the introduction of its new imax mpx theater system in  the company has agreed with several customers to terminate their existing lease agreements  which were in the company s backlog  and sign new mpx system agreements 
where these agreements have multiple elements meeting the criteria for treatment as separate units of accounting  the total consideration to be received in these situations generally is allocated to each individual element based on the relative fair values of each element 
each element is then accounted for based on applicable revenue recognition criteria 
operating leases of theater systems leases that do not transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the customer are classified as operating leases 
for these leases  initial rental fees and minimum lease payments are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term 
additional rentals in excess of minimum annual amounts are recognized as revenue when reported by theater operators  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d critical accounting policies cont d short term investments the company has short term investments  which generally have maturities of more than three months and less than one year from the date of purchase 
the short term investments are classified as held to maturity based on the company s positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
the company invests primarily in canadian and us government securities and commercial paper rated a by standard poor s and these investments are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
income related to these securities is reported as a component of interest income 
at december   the company had million invested in us government securities and million in canadian government securities 
accounts receivable and financing receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and provision against the financing receivables are based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances and the underlying asset value of the equipment under lease where applicable 
if there is a deterioration in a customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults under the terms of the leases are higher than the company s historical experience  the company s estimates of recoverability for these assets could be adversely affected 
the evaluation of collectibility of customer accounts is typically done on an individual account basis 
if  based on an evaluation of accounts  the company concludes that it is probable that a customer will not be able to pay all amounts due  the company estimates the expected loss 
in developing the estimates for an allowance  the company considers general and industry economic and market conditions as well as other credit information available for the customer 
the company only records recoveries of provisions when objective verifiable evidence supports the change in the original provision 
inventories in establishing the appropriate provisions for theater systems inventory  management must make estimates of future events and conditions including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts  potential future signings  general economic conditions  technology factors  growth prospects within the customers ultimate marketplace and the market acceptance of the company s current and pending projection systems and film library 
if management estimates of these events and conditions prove to be incorrect  it could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be adequate as at the balance sheet date 
film assets estimates of ultimate revenues are prepared on a title by title basis and reviewed regularly by management and revised where necessary to reflect the most current information 
ultimate revenue for films includes estimates of revenues over a period not to exceed years following the date of initial release 
goodwill the company performs an impairment test on at least an annual basis and additionally  whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flows approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
any impairment loss would be expensed in the statement of operations 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d critical accounting policies cont d fixed assets management reviews the carrying values of its fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
in performing its review for recoverability  management estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of impairment losses is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if the actual future cash flows are less than the company s estimates  future earnings could be adversely affected 
pension plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
a critical assumption  the discount rate  is an important element of expense and or liability measurement 
the company evaluates this critical assumption annually 
other assumptions include factors such as expected retirement  mortality  rate of compensation increase  and estimates of inflation 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the company s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves 
tax asset valuation as at december   the company had net deferred income tax assets of million  comprised of tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  which can be utilized to reduce either taxable income or taxes otherwise payable in future years 
the company s management assesses realization of these net deferred income tax assets based on all available evidence and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
positive evidence includes  but is not limited to  the company s historical earnings  projected future earnings  contracted sales backlog at december   and the ability to realize certain deferred income tax assets through loss and tax credit carryback strategies 
if and when the company s operations in some jurisdictions were to reach a requisite level of profitability or where the company s future profitability estimates increase due to changes in positive evidence  the company would reduce all or a portion of the applicable valuation allowance in the period when such determination is made 
this would result in an increase to reported earnings and a decrease to the company s effective tax rate in such period 
however  if the company s projected future earnings do not materialize  or if the company operates at a loss in certain jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in actual effective tax rates or time period within which the company s underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the company s deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase to the company s effective tax rate for the period of the change and a material adverse impact on its operating results for the period 
the company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the company may incur additional tax expense based upon the outcomes of such matters 
in addition  when applicable  the company adjusts tax expense to reflect both favorable and unfavorable examination results 
the company s ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of examinations and related tax positions require judgement and can materially increase or decrease its effective rate as well as impact operating results
