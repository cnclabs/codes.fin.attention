the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research  development and commercialization of novel biological products for the treatment and control of cancer 
proposed merger with micromet ag on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with micromet ag  or micromet  a privately held german company  that contains the terms and conditions of our proposed merger with that company 
the merger agreement provides that our wholly owned subsidiary  carlsbad acquisition corporation  will merge with and into micromet  inc  or micromet parent  a newly created parent corporation of micromet 
micromet parent will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and will be the surviving corporation of the merger 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  we will issue to micromet stockholders shares of our common stock and will assume all of the stock options  stock warrants and restricted stock of micromet outstanding as of the merger closing date  such that the micromet stockholders  option holders  warrant holders and note holders will own approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and our stockholders  option holders and warrant holders will own approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis 
the merger is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval by our stockholders 
we anticipate the merger will be completed in the second quarter of we filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february  a registration statement on form s that will be amended and includes a preliminary proxy statement prospectus and other relevant documents in connection with the proposed merger 
discontinuation of canvaxin clinical trials and development and manufacturing activities on october   we and serono technologies  sa  our canvaxin collaboration partner  announced the discontinuation of our phase clinical trial of our leading product candidate  canvaxin  in patients with stage iii melanoma  based on the recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring board  or dsmb  which completed its planned  third  interim analysis of data from this study on september  in april  we announced the discontinuation of our phase clinical trial of canvaxin in patients with stage iv melanoma based upon a similar recommendation of the independent dsmb 
the dsmb concluded  based on its planned  interim analysis of the data from these studies  that the data were unlikely to provide significant evidence of a survival benefit for canvaxin treated patients versus those receiving placebo 
there were no significant safety issues identified with either of the phase clinical trials of canvaxin  and the recommendations to close the studies were not made because of any potential safety concerns 
as a result of the discontinuation of the canvaxin phase clinical trials  in october we and serono announced the discontinuation of all further development and manufacturing activities with respect to canvaxin 
in october  we announced that our board of directors had approved a restructuring plan designed to realign resources in light of the decision to discontinue our phase clinical trial of canvaxin in patients with stage iii melanoma  as well as all further development of canvaxin and manufacturing activities at our canvaxin manufacturing facilities 
under the restructuring plan  in we reduced our workforce from to employees at december  and closed our biologics manufacturing facility and our warehouse facility 
we are actively seeking to sublease all three of our principal facilities 
in  we recorded a non recurring charge associated with our restructuring activities of million 
this non recurring restructuring charge includes million of employee severance costs  the substantial majority of 
table of contents which were cash expenditures that were paid in the fourth quarter of  and million of leased facility exit costs  representing the estimated future costs to be incurred under the operating leases for our biologics manufacturing facility and our warehouse facility  net of estimated sublease rentals 
in  we also recorded a non recurring charge for contract termination costs of million  which is included in research and development expenses 
in connection with our restructuring activities  we also recorded a non recurring  non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets of million in to write down the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
in january  we implemented additional restructuring measures which  when fully implemented  will result in the further reduction of our workforce to approximately employees by the completion of our proposed merger with micromet 
in connection with this workforce reduction  in we anticipate incurring approximately million of additional employee severance costs 
we also anticipate incurring additional leased facility exit costs in  primarily related to our corporate headquarters and research and development facility 
at this time  we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected amount of such additional leased facility exit costs  although our remaining obligations under the operating lease for our corporate headquarters and research and development facility aggregated million as of december  we may also incur additional contract termination and other restructuring costs 
we anticipate that our restructuring efforts will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of ongoing business activities we have other product candidates in research and preclinical development  including four humanized  anti angiogenic monoclonal antibodies and several peptides that may be useful for the treatment of patients with various solid tumors 
in february  we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  with the us food and drug administration to initiate a phase clinical trial for d  our leading humanized  anti angiogenic monoclonal antibody  in patients with solid tumors 
we also have rights to three product candidates targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  signaling pathway for the treatment of cancer  and we plan to actively seek sublicensing opportunities for these product candidates 
our efforts to identify  develop and commercialize and  in the case of the three product candidates that target the egfr signaling pathway  to sublicense  these product candidates are in an early stage and  therefore  these efforts are subject to a high risk of failure 
we were incorporated in delaware in june and have incurred net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we advance our preclinical anti angiogenesis product candidates into clinical development  expand our research and development programs  and in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our own 
we have a limited history of operations 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities as well as bank financing to fund certain equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in developing our early stage product candidates  the regulatory approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  our ability to manufacture our product candidates  competition from other products  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights  with maintaining our licenses related to our product candidates  obtaining the capital necessary to fund our ongoing operations and establishing and maintaining strategic collaborations to fund our product development efforts 

table of contents research and development through december   our research and development expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical development of canvaxin  including costs associated with the phase clinical trials of canvaxin  production of canvaxin for use in these clinical trials and manufacturing process  quality systems and analytical development for canvaxin  including compensation and other personnel expenses  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  facility costs  license fees and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million associated with the research and development of canvaxin  representing over of our total research and development expenses 
under our collaboration agreement with serono  we were entitled to receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales based objectives related to canvaxin 
as a result of the discontinuation of all further development and manufacturing activities with respect to canvaxin  we do not anticipate receiving any of these milestone payments  but we will continue to share equally with serono certain costs associated with the discontinuation of the canvaxin development program and manufacturing operations  as contemplated under the collaboration agreement 
serono may terminate the collaboration agreement for convenience upon days prior notice 
either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party 
in the event of a termination of the agreement  rights to canvaxin will revert to us 
following the discontinuation of all further canvaxin development and manufacturing activities  our research and development activities will primarily be focused on the development of product candidates based on our proprietary anti angiogenesis technology 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our other product candidates 
however  we expect our research and development costs associated with these product candidates to increase as we continue to develop new indications and move these product candidates through preclinical and clinical trials 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an on going basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
the costs and timing for developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the expenditure of substantial resources will be required for the lengthy process of clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals as well as to comply with applicable regulations 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets and restructuring activities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
table of contents on form k 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  revenue is recognized once all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
any amounts received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets 
collaborative research and development revenues  representing the portion of our pre commercialization expenses incurred under collaboration agreements that are shared with our partners  are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred  assuming that collectibility is reasonably assured and the amount is reasonably estimable 
nonrefundable up front license fees where we have continuing involvement in research and development and or other performance obligations are initially deferred and recognized as license fee revenue over the estimated period until completion of our performance obligations 
our estimates of the period over which we recognize revenue are based on the contractual terms of the underlying arrangement  the level of effort required for us to fulfill our obligations and the anticipated timing of the fulfillment of our obligations 
as our product candidates move through the clinical development and regulatory approval process  our estimates of the period over which we recognize revenue from nonrefundable up front license fees and milestone payments  if any  may change 
the effect of changes in our estimates of the revenue recognition period will be recognized prospectively over the remaining estimated period 
we regularly review our estimates of the period over which we have ongoing performance obligations 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
conditions that would necessitate a goodwill impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales and other sources  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to measure the impairment loss 
our goodwill had a carrying value of million at december  and and resulted from our acquisition of cell matrix  inc in january we have assigned the goodwill to our cell matrix reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was recoverable 
in determining the fair value of the cell matrix reporting unit  we considered internal risk adjusted cash flow projections which utilize several key assumptions  including estimated timing and costs 
table of contents to complete development of the anti angiogenesis technology and estimated future cash inflows from anticipated future collaborations and projected product sales 
our analysis of the fair value of the cell matrix reporting unit assumes the timely and successful completion of development of the anti angiogenesis technology 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development of the anti angiogenesis technology include the risk that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and the risk that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development will materialize as estimated 
subsequent to the completion of our annual goodwill impairment assessment for  as a result of our proposed merger with micromet  we performed an additional impairment assessment of our goodwill 
in determining the fair value of our cell matrix reporting unit for this goodwill impairment assessment  we assumed that the rights to the technology acquired from cell matrix would be sublicensed to third parties in exchange for certain up front  milestone and product sale royalty payments  and we would have no further involvement in the ongoing development and commercialization of the technology 
the estimated future net cash flows resulting from the sublicensing of the technology were risk adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the development process and discounted to their net present value 
based on the goodwill impairment assessment performed  we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was recoverable 
we cannot assure you that our future reviews of goodwill impairment will not result in a material charge 
impairment of long lived assets and restructuring activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used  including property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset or asset group  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
the determination of the undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals and estimating future cash inflows from product sales and other sources 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
as a result of our decision to discontinue all further development and manufacturing activities with respect to canvaxin and our proposed merger with micromet  in we performed a recoverability test of our long lived assets  including property and equipment and patents  in accordance with sfas no 
our ability to recover the carrying value of our property and equipment is based on the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the disposition of our property and equipment  including the estimated future cash inflows from anticipated sales of property and equipment  net of estimated asset disposition costs 
our estimate of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the disposition of our property and equipment considered the physical condition of the assets  quoted market prices for similar assets and the period of time in which we intend to dispose of the assets 
our ability to recover the carrying value of our patents is based on the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from our sublicensing of the rights to the patents and underlying technology  including the estimated future cash inflows from up front  milestone and product sale royalty payments  net of estimated ongoing development costs 
our estimate of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the disposition of our patents considered the technology s stage of development and market potential 

table of contents based on the recoverability analysis performed  management does not believe that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the disposition of certain of our long lived assets are sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets 
accordingly  in we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets of million to write down the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
under the restructuring plan approved by our board of directors in october  we reduced our workforce from to employees at december  and closed our biologics manufacturing facility and our warehouse facility 
we are actively seeking to sublease all three of our principal facilities 
in  we recorded a non recurring charge associated with our restructuring activities of million 
the non recurring restructuring charge includes million of employee severance costs  the substantial majority of which were cash expenditures that were paid in the fourth quarter of  and million of leased facility exit costs  representing the estimated future costs to be incurred under the operating leases for our biologics manufacturing facility and our warehouse facility  net of estimated sublease rentals 
in  we also recorded a non recurring charge for contract termination costs of million  which is included in research and development expenses 
in january  we implemented additional restructuring measures which  when fully implemented  will result in the further reduction of our workforce to approximately employees by the completion of our proposed merger with micromet 
in connection with this workforce reduction  in we anticipate incurring approximately million of additional employee severance costs 
we also anticipate incurring additional leased facility exit costs in  primarily related to our corporate headquarters and research and development facility 
at this time  we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected amount of such additional leased facility exit costs  although our remaining obligations under the operating lease for our corporate headquarters and research and development facility aggregated million as of december  we may also incur additional contract termination and other restructuring costs 
the timing and amounts of these restructuring costs will be based on  among other things  our ability to sublease our facilities  the timing of such subleases and the sublease rental rates obtained and the estimated termination dates of our employees and contracts 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate the amounts of these restructuring costs will materialize as estimated 
differences between our estimates and the actual timing of subleases and the sublease rates obtained and the actual timing and amounts paid for employee and contract terminations may result in additional restructuring costs 
we anticipate that our restructuring efforts will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenues for the years ended december  and consisted of license fee revenues of million and million  respectively  and collaborative research and development revenues of million and million  respectively  from our collaboration agreement with serono 
license fee revenues represent the portion of the million up front license fee received from serono in january recognized as revenue 
as a result of the discontinuation of canvaxin development and manufacturing activities  we have no further substantive performance obligations to serono under the collaboration agreement related to the ongoing development and commercialization of canvaxin 
accordingly  we recognized the remaining deferred up front license fee as revenue in collaborative research and development revenues represent serono s share of our canvaxin pre commercialization expenses under the agreement  which were incurred by us after the effective date of the collaboration agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in research and development expenses was due to decreased personnel expenses 
table of contents resulting from the reduction in our workforce in connection with our restructuring activities  decreased clinical trial expenses due to the discontinuation of the phase clinical trials of canvaxin in and million of technology access and transfer fees under our agreements with cimab  sa and ym biosciences  inc  which were recognized as research and development expenses in  as compared to million of technology access and transfer fees recognized in the decrease in research and development expenses was offset by increased facilities expenses associated with our warehouse facility leased in august  contract manufacturing and laboratory services expenses associated with d and our share of canvaxin pre commercialization expenses incurred by serono under the collaboration agreement 
non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from research and development expenses and reported under a separate caption 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased personnel expenses resulting from the reduction in our workforce in connection with our restructuring activities and decreased outside legal fees  offset by our share of canvaxin pre commercialization expenses incurred by serono under the collaboration agreement 
non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from general and administrative expenses and reported under a separate caption 
amortization of employee stock based compensation 
employee stock based compensation results from stock options granted to our employees and directors prior to our initial public offering with exercise prices that were deemed to be below the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the option grant date as well as stock awards with performance based vesting provisions granted to employees in we recorded the spread between the exercise price of the stock option or purchase price of the restricted stock and the fair value of the underlying common stock as deferred employee stock based compensation 
we amortize the deferred employee stock based compensation as a non cash charge to operations on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the award 
amortization of deferred employee stock based compensation was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
restructuring charges 
under the restructuring plan approved by our board of directors in october  we reduced our workforce from to employees at december  and closed our biologics manufacturing facility and our warehouse facility 
in  we recorded a non recurring charge associated with our restructuring activities of million  consisting of million of employee severance costs and million of leased facility exit costs 
impairment of long lived assets 
as a result of the discontinuation of all further canvaxin development and manufacturing activities  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets of million in to write down the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets to their estimated fair value in accordance with sfas no 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in interest income was primarily due to higher rates of interest on invested balances in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to the capitalization of interest expense on our million bank credit facility in related to the expansion of our biologics manufacturing facility 

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to no revenues for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  consisted of license fee revenues of million and collaborative research and development revenues of million from our collaboration agreement with serono 
the million up front license fee received from serono was being recognized as license fee revenue on a straight line basis over approximately years  which primarily represented the estimated period until regulatory approval and commercialization of canvaxin in patients with stage iv melanoma in the united states 
collaborative research and development revenues represent serono s share of our pre commercialization expenses under the agreement  which were incurred by us after the effective date of the collaboration agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in research and development expenses primarily reflects additional investment in personnel in the manufacturing  quality and research and development departments  increased clinical trial expenses associated with increased patient enrollment in our phase clinical trials of our lead product candidate  canvaxin  including costs associated with the production of canvaxin for use in these clinical trials  million of technology access and transfer fees under our agreements with cimab and ym biosciences  which were recognized as research and development expenses in  and payments totaling million made under our sublicense agreement with semaco  inc  which were recognized as research and development expenses 
non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from research and development expenses and reported under a separate caption 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects additional investment in personnel in the finance and marketing and business development departments  increased directors and officers insurance premiums and other expenses associated with our becoming a publicly traded company  increased legal fees and other expenses related to business development activities and increased expenses associated with marketing activities 
non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from general and administrative expenses and reported under a separate caption 
amortization of employee stock based compensation 
during the initial public offering process  we re evaluated the historical estimated fair value of our common stock considering the anticipated initial public offering price 
as a result  the exercise price of certain stock options that were previously granted to our employees and directors was deemed to be below the revised estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the option grant date 
we recorded this spread between the exercise price and the revised estimated fair value as deferred employee stock based compensation 
we amortize the deferred employee stock based compensation as a non cash charge to operations on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the options 
amortization of deferred employee stock based compensation was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances in resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our series c preferred stock and our initial public offering of common stock in the second half of interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to lower long term debt balances in due to the full repayment in january of the notes 
table of contents payable that were assumed in the january acquisition of cell matrix  offset by the interest expense associated with the prepayment in full of certain equipment and tenant improvement loans in december liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to the use of cash to fund ongoing operations  million of payments for employee severance benefits and million of net purchases of property and equipment  offset by payments aggregating million received from serono under the collaboration agreement and million of proceeds from long term debt 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to payments aggregating million received from serono under the collaboration agreement  including the million up front license fee received from serono in january net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  significant components of cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december  included a million net decrease in our securities available for sale portfolio and million of net purchases of property and equipment 
significant components of cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december  included a million net increase in our securities available for sale portfolio  million of purchases of property and equipment and a million decrease in restricted cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of proceeds from borrowings on our million bank credit facility 
significant components of cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  included the million proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to serono in december and net payments on long term debt of million 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following our ability to rapidly and cost effectively complete the closure activities associated with our clinical trials and development and manufacturing activities for canvaxin  and to sublease our manufacturing and warehouse facilities associated with canvaxin on satisfactory terms  our ability to sublease our corporate headquarters and research and development facility  the costs involved in the research and preclinical and clinical development of d and our other anti angiogenesis product candidates  the costs involved in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the scope  prioritization and number of programs we pursue  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property claims  the manufacturing costs associated with our product candidates  our ability to enter into corporate collaborations and the terms and success of these collaborations  our acquisition and development of new technologies and product candidates  
table of contents the risk of product liability claims inherent in the manufacturing  testing and marketing of therapies for treating people with cancer or other diseases  and competing technological and market developments 
under our merger agreement with micromet  either party may be obligated to pay a termination fee of million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances 
additionally  we anticipate incurring an aggregate of approximately million of expenses associated with the merger  of which we have incurred approximately million through december  under the restructuring plan approved by our board of directors in october  we reduced our workforce from to employees at december  and closed our biologics manufacturing facility and our warehouse facility 
we are actively seeking to sublease all three of our principal facilities 
in january  we implemented additional restructuring measures which  when fully implemented  will result in the further reduction of our workforce to approximately employees by the completion of our proposed merger with micromet 
in connection with this workforce reduction  in we anticipate incurring approximately million of additional employee severance costs 
we also anticipate incurring additional leased facility exit costs in  primarily related to our corporate headquarters and research and development facility 
at this time  we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected amount of such additional leased facility exit costs  although our remaining obligations under the operating lease for our corporate headquarters and research and development facility aggregated million as of december  we may also incur additional contract termination and other restructuring costs 
we anticipate that our restructuring efforts will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of in december  we entered into an million loan and security agreement with a financing institution 
as of december   we have borrowed the full million available under the credit facility  of which million was used to repay our outstanding borrowings under a credit facility secured in and the remaining borrowings were used to finance certain capital expenditures 
at our election  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to the greater of the bank s prime rate or 
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility was as of december  through december   we made interest only payments on the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
commencing january  we are also required to make principal payments due in monthly installments 
all borrowings under the credit facility must be paid in full by december  we have granted the financing institution a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  excluding our intellectual property 
in addition to various customary affirmative and negative covenants  the loan and security agreement requires us to maintain  as of the last day of each calendar quarter  aggregate cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale in an amount at least equal to the greater of i our quarterly cash burn multiplied by or ii the then outstanding principal amount of the obligations under such agreement multiplied by in the event that we breach this financial covenant  we are obligated to pledge and deliver to the bank a certificate of deposit in an amount equal to the then outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  the loan and security agreement contains certain customary events of default  including  among other things  non payment of principal and interest  violation of covenants  the occurrence of a material adverse change in our ability to satisfy our obligations under the loan agreement or with respect to the lender s security interest in our assets and in the event we are involved in certain insolvency proceedings 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lender may be entitled to  among other things  accelerate all of our obligations and sell our assets to satisfy our obligations under the loan agreement 
in addition  in an event of default  our outstanding obligations may be subject to increased rates of interest 
the terms of the loan and security agreement also require that it be repaid in full upon the occurrence of a change in control event  such as the consummation of our proposed merger with micromet ag see note 
accordingly  as management believes it is probable that the proposed merger with micromet will be consummated in 
table of contents  we have classified the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as current as of december  to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities as well as through equipment and leasehold improvement financing 
through december   we have received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
in addition  through december   we have borrowed an aggregate of approximately million under certain credit facilities primarily to finance the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
our remaining obligation under these credit facilities as of december  consists solely of borrowings under our million bank credit facility 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue for at least the next several years 
absent our proposed merger with micromet  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale as of december  and the remaining cost sharing payments from serono associated with the costs of the discontinuation of the canvaxin development program and manufacturing operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements until september  we will need to raise additional funds to meet future working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we have filed a shelf registration statement  declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on december   under which we may raise up to million through the sale of our common stock 
we may also raise additional funds through additional debt financing or through additional strategic collaboration agreements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  our financial instruments consisted principally of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and us government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
additionally  we do not invest in foreign currencies or other foreign investments 
borrowings under our million bank credit facility secured in december bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to the greater of the bank s prime rate or as of december  and therefore expose us to interest rate risk 
based on the outstanding borrowings under our million bank credit facility at december  of million  a hypothetical increase in the prime rate would result in an approximately million increase in our annual interest expense
