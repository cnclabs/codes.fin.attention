item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included at item overview we are a leading global provider of technology products and services for the tracking and recovery of valuable mobile assets 
our proprietary technology  wireless network and unique integration with law enforcement agencies provide an effective means for tracking and recovery of stolen vehicles and construction equipment 
in the first quarter of  we expanded the use of our technology to motorcycles 
in october  we acquired boomerang  the dominant marketer and provider of stolen vehicle recovery technology in canada 
we have three separately managed and reported business segments domestic  international and boomerang 
domestic segment we develop and market the lojack system  a unique  patented system designed to assist law enforcement personnel in locating  tracking and recovering stolen vehicles 
we also offer lojack early warning as an option to the lojack system which provides early notification to a vehicle owner in the event an unauthorized user is operating the vehicle 
our revenues in the united states are derived primarily from the sale of lojack units and related products  lojack early warning and extended products  and non recovery warranties to consumers 
approximately of domestic sales are made through a distribution network consisting of dealers of new and used automobiles 
we have strong consumer brand awareness in the united states and in many areas around the world 
we continue to expand our installation capacity and increase efficiencies by adopting alternative installation methods through contracting with certified dealers and other third parties to perform the installation of the lojack unit 
we monitor the quality of these alternative installations through the use of an expanded quality control process and we maintain full warranty service of lojack units  both for the convenience of dealers through which the lojack units are marketed and to maintain a high degree of quality control and security over our technology 
we also offer an extended warranty at the point of sale to new customers and through direct sales efforts to existing customers 
we record additions to deferred revenue for our lojack early warning product and certain warranty products for which we have been deemed to be the primary obligor of the underlying contract 
we receive full payment typically within days of the transaction  but recognition of the deferred revenue is spread over the estimated life of the product or service 
these payments are a significant component of our cash flow from operations 
additions of these components of deferred revenue were  for the year ended december   compared to additions of  for the same period a year ago 
international segment internationally  our licensed stolen vehicle recovery technology is operational in countries and territories around the world 
we have a licensed presence in latin and south america  europe and africa  and the asia pacific rim 
we derive an increasing percentage of our consolidated revenues from international licensees 
these revenues consist of product sales  royalties and license fees 
revenues from the international segment comprised approximately of consolidated revenues for the year ended december   up from in and in we record additions to deferred revenue for international license fees and recognize the revenue over the term of the license generally ten years 
royalty revenues are recognized when earned 
boomerang segment revenues from our boomerang segment are derived primarily from the sale of boomerang  boomerang and boomerangxpress units  related products  and service contracts 
revenues from the boomerang segment comprised 
table of contents approximately of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  approximately of revenues are derived from the sale of boomerang  boomerang and boomerangxpress units through auto accessory retailers and automobile dealers 
approximately of revenues are derived from service contracts 
more than insurance companies based in quebec and ontario offer rebates to customers who install a boomerang unit in their high priced or high risk of theft vehicles  and in many instances  require installation of a boomerang unit 
purchasers of boomerang units are required to also purchase a service contract 
the terms of service contracts offered range from to months and are payable in full upon activation of the related unit or renewal of a previous service contract 
as of december   there was approximately  of deferred revenue resulting from approximately  active service contracts 
recent developments and trends many companies in the vehicle security market have stated that they offer stolen vehicle recovery solutions and many automobile manufacturers are installing gps products at the factory 
these factors have not had a material adverse impact on our revenues  unit sales or penetration rates thus far 
while the long term impact of these trends is hard to predict  we are evaluating the effectiveness of additional complementary technology combining gps and or cellular based communications with our time tested rf based stolen vehicle recovery technology 
we are deriving an increasing percentage of our revenues from outside of the united states  increasing to of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  from which included boomerang s results for two months of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  and of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  we expect the trend of increasing revenues and profits generated by operations outside the united states as a percentage of consolidated results to continue in the percentage of domestic units installed by third parties increased significantly during the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier  decreasing average direct installation labor cost per unit due to productivity improvements and the shift of expenses from fixed to variable 
we expect that the percentage of business through third party installers and distributors to moderate in but continue to have a positive impact on unit volumes and gross margin percentages 
key factors of our business key factors and areas of focus by our senior management across all segments include focusing on increasing penetration rates through our existing automobile dealer channel and markets  sharing best practices among our international licensees and analyzing those practices which have been successful  including the effectiveness of strategic relationships with distributors  insurance companies and original equipment manufacturers  and the success of different pricing models such as those that include recurring payments  continuing to reduce domestic and international manufactured product costs  continuing to transition from a fixed to variable domestic installation cost structure by increasing the percentage of lojack units installed by third parties  continuing to develop improved technology and products  increasing the sales of our commercial offerings and the geographic expansion of our motorcycle product  and continuing to develop relationships with insurance companies to help drive demand  where applicable 
we evaluate our financial condition and operating performance based on the progress in achieving the key factors listed above 
boomerang acquisition on october   we completed our acquisition of boomerang for consideration of approximately  the acquisition extended our capabilities in stolen vehicle recovery technology to canada 
boomerang generated sales of  for the year ended december  and  for the two months ended december  boomerang s operations  beginning from the date of acquisition  are reported within our results from operations as a separate segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements include lojack and the accounts of our subsidiaries  most of which are wholly owned 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation 
management is required  in certain instances  to use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the actual results could differ from those estimates 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the significant 
table of contents accounting policies and estimates  which we believe to be the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial position and results of operations  include revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
we earn revenues primarily from the domestic sale and installation of lojack units and lojack early warning  the sale of products and components to international licensees  the receipt of international license fees and royalties  the sale of extended and enhanced warranty programs  the sale of boomerang  boomerang and boomerangxpress units  related products  and service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue on domestic and canadian sales of lojack units and boomerang units and related products upon installation  or upon shipment to our installation partners and distributors 
revenues relating to the sale of lojack early warning are recognized over the period of the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which management estimates is approximately five years 
as of december  and  we had deferred recognition of revenue of approximately  and  respectively  related to this product 
if the estimated life of vehicle ownership proves to vary materially from the estimates we use  we would be required to change our estimates  which could result in material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period 
historically  there have not been any changes to our five year estimate 
revenues relating to the sale of service contracts by our boomerang segment are recognized over the life of the contract 
the term of service contracts offered ranges from to months and are payable in full upon activation of the related unit or renewal of a previous service contract 
we sell several types of extended warranties 
for those warranties to which a third party  and not us  is the primary obligor  we recognize payments for these insurance contracts  net of related costs  in revenues at the time of sale 
revenues related to extended warranties  for which a third party is the primary obligor  aggregated approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the laws of jurisdictions change so that we are determined to be the primary obligor  revenues may have to be deferred under such circumstances 
we believe that these jurisdictional changes are possible and should they occur  reported revenues could be adversely impacted 
for those warranties for which we are the primary obligor  revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated term of the warranties  determined to be equivalent to the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which is five years 
such revenues recognized from extended warranties previously deferred aggregated approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the estimated life of vehicle ownership varies significantly from the estimates we use  material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period could result 
incremental costs directly related to the provision of such warranties are deferred and charged to expense proportionately as the revenues are recognized 
any remaining warranty costs relating to actual claims made are recognized when incurred 
we believe the likelihood of material changes to the average estimated life of vehicle ownership is low 
accounts receivable 
domestic accounts receivable are due principally from automobile dealers that are geographically dispersed 
if the creditworthiness or the financial strength of the dealers were to decline  there could be an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
the terms under which we generally sell products and components of the lojack system to international licensees include cash prepayments  purchased private trade credit insurance or  most commonly  established payment terms 
should geopolitical situations change in the countries where our international licensees operate  there could be additional credit risks 
accounts receivable related to our boomerang segment consist of payments due from our automotive dealers and accessory retailers 
in the normal course of business  we monitor the financial condition of our customers 
our management does not believe that we have significant exposure to any individual customer 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts that corresponds to the creditworthiness of our customers  historical trends and economic circumstances 
changes to these estimates are possible and could result in a material effect on our balance sheet and reported results of operations 
valuation of cost investments 
periodically  we have made investments in our international licensees 
as of december   investments in international licensees  totaling  included a equity interest  with a carrying value of  in our mexican licensee and a equity interest  with a carrying value of  in our french licensee 
we do not exercise significant control over these licensees  and as such we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments made 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed 
based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows  market conditions  legal factors  market potential  operational performance  and in some cases  independent appraisals  we have concluded that there are no impairments to the fair value of these investments that should be viewed as other than temporary 
the international 
table of contents licensees in which we have made investments are in the early stages of operations and continue to develop their business models 
we may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period if a licensee requires additional capital and is unable to raise sufficient capital to continue operations  a licensee raises sufficient capital  but at a lower stock price than currently valued and or the operations and future cash flows of the licensee vary significantly from current projections  adversely affecting the viability of the business 
we have not recorded any gains or losses on these investments through december  while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in operating in these international markets could materially affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of these investments 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item valuation of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill 
as part of the october acquisition of boomerang  we recorded certain identifiable assets and goodwill see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually  in the fourth quarter  in the case of goodwill 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and or goodwill might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
no such impairment charges have been recorded to date 
at december  and  there was  and  respectively of intangible assets  of which  and  respectively  represented goodwill 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill could result in a material  non cash expense in the consolidated statement of income 
income taxes and deferred taxes 
we file income tax returns in canada  brazil and italy as well as many states and localities within the united states 
we must estimate our income tax expense after considering  among other factors  differing tax rates between jurisdictions  allocation factors  tax credits  nondeductible items and changes in enacted tax rates 
a change in our effective income tax rate would have the effect of changing net income by approximately  or per diluted share after tax 
deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting  known as temporary differences 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets generally result in tax deductions or credits subsequent to the period in which the related item was recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
in  we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately  related to lojack italia s net operating losses 
a valuation allowance has been established against lojack italia s losses because we determined that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized because of the lack of historical evidence 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate future taxable income in lojack italia becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  which may result in income tax benefits in our consolidated statement of income 
it is anticipated that we will book additional valuation allowances for lojack italia in the next two to three year period as it is expected to generate additional net operating losses 
deferred tax liabilities typically reflect a current tax deduction for which the related item has not yet been recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets assumes that there will be sufficient future taxable income generated in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with little need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein at item  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states

year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   domestic segment revenues increased by  or  as compared to the same period one year ago  primarily due to an increase in revenue of  or  primarily resulting from a increase in the number of lojack units sold during the period  partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per unit sold 
the decreased average revenue per unit sold reflects the increasing percentage of units sold through our third party installers and distributors as well as increased volume discounts and incentives earned by customers during units sold through third parties yield lower per unit sales prices because the installation is performed by the third party  not us  an increase of  or  in revenue recognized from the sale of warranty products  an increase of  or  relating to lojack early warning as the number of installed units continues to grow 
revenue for this product is initially deferred and then recognized over years  the estimated life of vehicle ownership  and introduction of our new motorcycle product in which generated  in incremental revenue 
for the year ended december   international segment revenues increased by  or  as compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to an increase in revenues of  or  resulting mainly from additional shipments of lojack units to our licensees in latin and south america  which experienced a significant increase in demand developed through their partnerships with insurance companies and other channel partners  and increased royalty revenues of  or  from our international licensees as the number of units installed in the licensees customer base  which positively impacts the royalty calculation  continues to increase 
revenues from our boomerang segment totaled  compared to  in this was due to the fact that boomerang s results were reflected in our operations for an entire year in  as opposed to only two months in throughout the year there has been a decline of units sold at boomerang which has had a negative impact on the segment s revenue in we have taken several steps throughout the year to reverse this trend 
we introduced a new product boomerangxpress to serve the mid price auto market  improved the quality of our installations  developed a stronger quality control process and introduced the lojack business model to the toronto marketplace 
we believe these actions will result in a stronger revenue performance in the boomerang segment in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period one year ago 
domestic cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period a year ago  reflecting continuing initiatives to reduce the overall installed cost of the product  including various distribution and installation programs to more cost effectively sell and install lojack units by utilizing third parties 
while domestic unit sales increased by in as compared to the same period a year ago  total installation expense for the same period increased by only 
the distribution and installation programs contributed to the average direct installation labor cost per unit decrease of 
we expect that the percentage of business conducted through third party installers and distributors will continue to increase during  though at a more moderate pace  and will result in 
table of contents a continued positive impact on reducing installation cost per unit sold 
international cost of goods sold for the year ended december  decreased to of revenues  from of revenues for the same period a year ago 
this decrease was largely due to the impact of foreign exchange rates on inventory manufactured and sold in brazil 
boomerang cost of goods sold for the year ended december  increased to of revenues  from of revenues for the same period a year ago 
historically boomerang s gross margins have not been subject to much fluctuation 
product development product development expenses increased by  or  in as compared to the same period a year earlier 
domestic and international product development expenses were  less than last year as there was a shift in spending from third party development providers to internally developed technology 
in our engineering focus was spent on providing engineering capability to support new products and infrastructure equipment 
in  the company had relied significantly on a third party vendor to develop and make ready for manufacturing the next generation lojack unit 
in these units were manufactured and began to be installed in vehicles 
the domestic and international product development savings were offset by  in product development expenses at our boomerang segment 
this increase reflects a full year of product development expenditures as opposed to only two months in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased  or  in as compared to the same period one year ago 
thirty five percent  or  of the increase reflects the full year impact of boomerang s sales and marketing expenses in our operations 
the remaining  of the increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to a  increase in compensation expense for our domestic direct and indirect sales force as a result of our improved sales performance over the prior year  a  increase in dealer support and development expenses  a  increase in bad debt expense due to the increase in sales volume  a  of increase in media and advertising costs and a  increase in our law enforcement liaison costs primarily in compensation and travel expense due to our domestic expansion in we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales to increase in to support our planned investment in personnel  advertising  and other marketing initiatives relating to the launch of new products  the full year impact of entering new domestic markets and our expected commercial launch in italy in mid general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by  or  as compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to increased compensation and personnel related expenses of  for domestic and international administrative personnel necessary to support growth  increased consulting and accounting related costs of  primarily spent for identifying partners to license our technology and products in china and italy and for tax support in structuring our international expansion  an increase of  in legal expenses relating to the litigation primarily for the clare litigation  initiating patent and trademark protection for our boomerang products in the united states and legal costs in supporting the our international expansion  and an increase of  in expenses relating to boomerang which was included in our results for the entire year in as opposed to only two months in general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in with a significant portion of the increase coming in the form of non cash compensation as the company adopted fas r  effective january  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for increased by  or over the increase is primarily related to  of depreciation and amortization expense related to our boomerang segment  of which  is amortization of intangibles derived from our acquisition in october the remaining  of the depreciation and amortization expense increase reflects higher fixed asset balances in our domestic segment 

table of contents other income other income for the year decreased by  or when compared to this decrease is attributable to the following interest income increased by  due to the significant increase in our invested cash balances during due to positive cash flow from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
interest expense in increased  due to months of interest expense on debt incurred as a result of the boomerang acquisition as compared to months in other income  besides interest  decreased by  in as compared to in   of other income was attributable to i a  dividend relating to our investment in our mexican licensee and ii  of foreign exchange gains relating to several united states dollar denominated loans payable from lojack do brasil 
this is compared to where other income was primarily attributable to a gain of  resulting from the settlement of a foreign exchange contract entered into in august  which matured in october  to hedge our canadian dollar commitment to acquire boomerang 
interest income may not be comparable in as we continue to evaluate alternative uses of our cash balances such as investing in international expansion  potential acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock 
we will continue to monitor our foreign currency exposure and will implement a hedging strategy if we feel that we are materially at risk and that the hedge is cost effective 
interest expense in will continue to be comprised of the interest associated with the debt incurred with the boomerang acquisition but  absent any new debt  will decline as principal payments reduce the outstanding amount of the borrowings 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by  in  as compared to the same period one year ago 
the increase was a result of  in additional taxable income in  as compared to the same period in our effective combined federal and state tax rate for was as compared to in three percent of the decrease in the effective rate was due to a favorable audit settlement with the commonwealth of massachusetts resulting in the reversal of a previously provided tax contingency and percent of the decrease was due to a lower effective tax rate for our international subsidiaries 
net income and earnings per share as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by  to  in  from  in during  we experienced dilution in earnings per share due to increased weighted average diluted shares as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increases in weighted average diluted common shares outstanding reflects i the exercise of existing stock options  ii new shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan and iii a larger number of stock options being included in the dilution calculations because the market price of our common stock increased to a point where the stock options exercise prices were less than the average market price of the common stock 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  in october  we acquired boomerang as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item the assets  liabilities and stockholders equity of boomerang are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and boomerang s results for the two months ended december  are included in the statement of income for the year ended december  the table below presents the boomerang results for the two months ended december  and the results for lojack for the years ended december  and in thousands

in addition  the increase also includes increased royalty revenues from a licensee  as certain royalty payments relating to previous quarters that were in dispute were collected in the second quarter of offset by  
table of contents a decrease of  in license fees resulting primarily from the termination of contracts with certain licensees and certain revenue recognized in in connection with the resolution of previously existing contingencies under the related licensee agreement  and a decrease of  or  in infrastructure component sales to our licensees

net income and earnings per share as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by  to  in  from  in during  we experienced dilution in earnings per share due to increased weighted average diluted shares as compared to the same period one year earlier 
the increases in weighted average diluted common shares outstanding reflects i new shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan  ii the exercise of existing stock options and iii a larger number of stock options being included in the dilution calculations because the market price of our common stock increased to a point where the stock options exercise prices were less than the average market price of the common stock 
in addition  in connection with our acquisition of boomerang   shares of our common shares and  exchangeable shares of exchangeco were issued in october liquidity and capital resources in october  we entered into a multicurrency credit agreement  to provide debt financing for the acquisition of boomerang and to replace a prior revolving line of credit facility 
the multicurrency credit agreement is comprised of an unsecured  revolving line of credit  or the line of credit  and a term loan 
the outstanding borrowings under the term loan used for the boomerang acquisition totaled cad  us dollar equivalent of  as of december  borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate  adjustable quarterly  at our option  at either the canadian base rate or a euro currency denominated rate canadian libor 
the canadian base rate is defined as the greater of the canadian prime rate at december  or the canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptance rate plus totaling at december  
the canadian libor rate at december  was 
the term loan requires that we make quarterly principal payments of cad  per quarter from march through october  when all outstanding balances become due 
during the second quarter of we elected to pay an additional voluntary principal payment of cad  we may continue to make additional voluntary principal payments in the future depending on future cash flows 
in january  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement relating to the term loan 
in accordance with the interest rate cap agreement  we are entitled to proceeds equal to the amount by which the canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptance rate exceeds multiplied by the notional amount of the hedge outstanding 
as of december   the canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptance rate was and the notional value of the interest rate cap was cad  borrowings under the  line of credit facility must be denominated in us dollars 
no borrowings under the line of credit were outstanding at december  the multicurrency credit agreement generally contains limitations on certain investments  acquisitions and or mergers  and prohibits disposition of assets other than in the normal course of business 
additionally  we are required to maintain certain financial performance measures including minimum leverage and ebitda ratios  minimum net worth levels and maximum capital expenditures 
the payment of dividends is permitted under the multicurrency credit agreement and is limited only to the extent such payments affect our ability to meet certain financial performance measures 
failure to maintain compliance with covenants could impair the availability of the facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the multicurrency credit agreement 
in july  we executed two amendments to the existing multicurrency credit agreement 
the first amendment eliminated a restriction that limited our ability to repurchase shares of our capital stock 
the second amendment added a cad  revolving line of credit facility for our boomerang segment 
borrowings under this canadian dollar denominated line of credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate  at our option  based either on the canadian base rate or a euro currency denominated rate 
any amounts outstanding under the line of credit may be repaid and then can be reborrowed until october   the line of credit termination date when all outstanding balances become due 
along with 
table of contents the addition of the line of credit facility  the second amendment increased the amounts allowed under the financial covenant for capital expenditures 
in may  we entered into an agreement with our lender for cad  in overdraft protection for our boomerang segment 
interest on this overdraft protection will be based on the lender s prime rate plus basis points 
in september  the multicurrency agreement was amended to redefine the criteria whereby we may repurchase capital stock 
the third amendment allows us to initiate a capital stock repurchase plan at any time as long no default or event of default exists 
we also have a  revolving credit note  or the demand line 
outstanding borrowings under the demand line bear interest  payable monthly  at the bank s base rate at december   or if converted at our option  based upon the libor rate plus basis points totaling at december  
as of december   we had two irrevocable letters of credit in the aggregate amount of  outstanding 
these letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow under this demand line 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the demand line 
we generate positive cash flows from our operations and expect this trend to continue in both the short and long term 
this liquidity is contingent on continued customer demand for our products and services and continuing our existing relationships with automobile dealers and insurance companies  international licensees and certain law enforcement agencies 
we expect to continue these relationships 
we believe that we will be able to keep pace with required technological changes in our products and expect that our sales and marketing initiatives will continue to drive demand 
additional uses of cash will be based on rate of return analyses  but may include possible acquisitions  repurchase of our common stock  investments in new technologies  products and or international licensees or markets  which may require substantial investments of capital 
on february   our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan  or the repurchase plan 
the repurchase plan authorizes us to purchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock over the next two years 
we plan to continue to improve and expand our infrastructure and explore opportunities in international markets  including the potential for strategic partnerships or acquisitions  alliances and or equity investments 
in october  we implemented an initiative in italy to be the majority owner and operator of the lojack stolen vehicle recovery network 
majority ownership of the italian network is part of our strategy to own a controlling interest in select international markets that present a significant opportunity 
this ownership will result in cash outlays of approximately  over the next three years and we expect to commercially launch the italian operation by mid this includes a capital investment to implement the lojack network and recognition of the italian subsidiary s operating losses 
we anticipate that the long term profitability generated by the italian operation after the investment period and the value that will be created as a result of the recurring fee structure will provide us with an adequate return on this investment 
domestically  we intend to continue to develop new technologies and may introduce new products that leverage our brand recognition  proven technology and knowledge of the process of stolen vehicle recovery 
in july  we announced a strategic direction that will enable us to establish nationwide coverage for our tracking and recovery system through an upgrade and expansion of our network 
we are presently seeking federal government approval for our plan to move to nationwide coverage as well as to track and recover a variety of valuable mobile assets and we are also in the process of complying with fcc regulations to change our network from wideband to narrowband 
the federal government s move from wide to narrowband channels requires us to make changes to our existing infrastructure that also will accelerate the timetable for the transition to a nationwide mobile asset recovery system 
in  we expanded our domestic operations to include north carolina  ohio and oregon 
because we have reduced the capital and operating costs required to enter new markets  we expect to shorten the period of time for these three markets to become profitable 
we will expand into additional markets as they become economically feasible 
in march  we expanded into south carolina and plan to expand our lojack system to or additional states in we expect the initiative to own and operate the italian stolen vehicle recovery network coupled with our longer term international investment requirements and domestic expansion to be funded using existing cash  cash flows from operations and  if needed  our borrowing facilities 
we expect capital expenditures for to total as much as  which we will fund out of our existing working capital  which was  as of december  if we pursue significant opportunities in international markets  we may be required to find additional sources of capital 
we believe the sources available to us will be adequate for our present and anticipated needs 
we plan to fund our existing operations  including capital expenditures  using existing cash  cash flows from operations and  if needed  the existing line of credit and demand facilities discussed above
