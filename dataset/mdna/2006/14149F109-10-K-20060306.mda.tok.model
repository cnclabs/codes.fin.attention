item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of our operations for the years ended december   and the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
caution about forward looking statements we make certain forward looking statements in this form k that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include statements regarding our profitability  liquidity  allowance for loan losses  interest rate sensitivity  market risk  growth strategy  and financial and other goals 
the words believes  expects  may  will  should  projects  contemplates  anticipates  forecasts  intends  or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies if we are unable to identify attractive markets  locations or opportunities to expand in the future  changes in interest rates and the successful management of interest rate risk  risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values  maintaining cost controls and asset quality as we open or acquire new branches  maintaining capital levels adequate to support our growth  reliance on our management team  including our ability to attract and retain key personnel  competition with other banks and financial institutions  and companies outside of the banking industry  including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources  changes in general economic and business conditions in our market area  demand  development and acceptance of new products and services  problems with technology utilized by us  changing trends in customer profiles and behavior  changes in banking  other laws and regulations applicable to us  and other factors discussed in risk factors in item a above 
because of these uncertainties  our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
overview we are a locally managed financial holding company headquartered in tysons corner  virginia  committed to providing superior customer service  a diversified mix of financial products and services  and convenient banking to our retail and business consumers 
we own cardinal bank the bank  a virginia state chartered community bank  cardinal wealth services  inc cws  an investment services subsidiary  and wilson bennett capital management  inc wilson bennett  an alexandria  virginia based asset management firm acquired in june through these three subsidiaries and george mason mortgage  llc george mason  a mortgage banking subsidiary of the bank  we offer a wide range of traditional banking products and services to both our commercial and retail customers 
our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors  commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals  such as physicians  accountants and attorneys 
we have twenty two branch office locations  nine mortgage banking office locations and provide competitive products and services 
we complement our core banking operations by offering a full range of investment products and services to our customers through our third party brokerage relationship with raymond james financial services  inc and asset management services through wilson bennett 
on june   we acquired wilson bennett for a total consideration of million  which consisted of a payment of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of our common stock  which we valued at million 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase and wilson bennett s assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the purchase date 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
we believe that the wilson bennett acquisition furthers our strategies of enhancing fee income and diversifying our revenue stream and the services we deliver to our customers 
wilson bennett uses a value oriented approach that focuses on large capitalization stocks 
wilson bennett s primary source of revenue is management fees earned on the assets it manages for its customers 
these management fees are generally based upon the market value of assets under management and  accordingly  revenues from wilson bennett will  assuming a consistent base  be more when appropriate indices  such as the s p  are higher and lower when such indices are depressed 
when we acquired wilson bennett  it had approximately million of assets under management 
at december   assets under management by wilson bennett were approximately million 
while we anticipated an initial decline in the assets under management at the time of the acquisition  significant further declines in the assets managed by wilson bennett may result in an impairment condition  which would require an impairment charge if we determine the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets is greater than their fair value 
on july   we acquired george mason in a cash transaction for million 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and million of amortizable intangible assets 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and george mason s assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the purchase date  and its operating results are included in our consolidated results since the date of the acquisition 
george mason  based in fairfax  virginia  engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through nine branches located throughout the metropolitan washington  dc region 
george mason has approximately employees and does business in eight states  primarily virginia  maryland  and the district of columbia 
george mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater washington metropolitan area  generating originations of approximately billion of loans in  excluding advances on construction loans and including loans purchased from other mortgage banking companies which are owned by local home builders but managed by george mason and billion of loans in  which includes managed company originations and loans originated of billion prior to our acquisition of george mason 
george mason s primary sources of revenue include net interest income earned on loans held for sale  gains on sales of loans and contractual management fees earned relating to services provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders 
loans are made pursuant to purchase commitments and are sold servicing released 
george mason also offers a construction to permanent loan program 
this program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences 
once the home has been completed  the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market 
these construction to permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for george mason and are classified as loans held for sale 
george mason s business is both cyclical and seasonal 
the cyclical nature of its business is influenced by  among other factors  the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates  national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy 
historically  george mason has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year 
in july  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cardinal statutory trust i  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are due in and pay interest at a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus  which adjusts quarterly 
these securities are redeemable at a premium through march and at par thereafter 
the interest rate on this debt was at december  we have guaranteed payment of these securities 
the million payable by us to cardinal statutory trust i is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since cardinal statutory trust i is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the bank 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize  and concurrently stabilize  net interest income 
we do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it entirely 
in addition to management of interest rate risk  we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk 
loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit 
in addition to net interest income  non interest income is an increasingly important source of revenue for us and includes  among other things  service charges on deposits and loans  investment fee income and gains and losses on sales of investment securities available for sale  gains on sales of loans and management fee income 
our acquisition of george mason in july has resulted in non interest income becoming a larger component of our total revenues  and the acquisition of wilson bennett in june has further contributed to this trend 
net interest income and non interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue for the three years ended december  net interest income non interest income non interest income is a larger percentage of our total revenue in than primarily because we owned george mason for a full year in compared to approximately a half year in our business strategy is to grow through geographic expansion  while maintaining strong asset quality and achieving increased profitability 
we completed a secondary common stock offering that raised million in capital during the second quarter of this capital is being used to support our continuing expansion and balance sheet growth 
as a result of this increased capital and retained earnings  we increased our legal lending limit to million as of december   which allows us to expand our commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
financial developments the year ended december  was our first full year of profitability 
we had net income available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share in  primarily as a result of an income tax benefit of million attributable to the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to cumulative losses since our inception  as we determined that it was more likely than not that these assets would be realized 
the pretax profit to common shareholders in was million 
the year ended december  was our second year of profitability 
for that year  net income was million 
george mason was included in our operating results since july  and contributed approximately million to consolidated net income during the decrease in net income from the prior year was the result of the previously described tax benefit being recognized in total assets increased by million in  from million at december   to billion at december  total loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs  increased to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
total deposits increased by million in  from million at december   to million at december  the year ended december  was our third consecutive year of profitability 
for the year  we reported net income of million 
george mason was included in our operating results for the full year and contributed million to consolidated net income during wilson bennett is included in our operating results since june   the date of its acquisition  and contributed  of pretax income 
total assets increased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  total loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs  increased to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
total deposits increased by million in  from million at december   to billion at december  critical accounting policies general us generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting  and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions  judgments  and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such judgments  assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
actual results  in fact  could differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for economic hedging activities  and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
accounting for business combinations we account for acquisitions of other businesses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
this statement mandates the use of purchase accounting and  accordingly  assets and liabilities  including previously unrecorded assets and liabilities  are recorded at fair values as of the acquisition date 
we utilize a variety of valuation methods to estimate fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
these methodologies are often based upon assumptions and estimates which may change at a future date and require that the carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired be adjusted 
to reduce the possibility of future adjustments  we have utilized independent consultants to identify and value identifiable purchased intangibles 
the difference between the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and any other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested on at least an annual basis for impairment 
to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of the individual borrowers 
unusual and infrequently occurring events  such as hurricanes and other weather related disasters  may impact our assessment of possible credit losses 
as a part of our analysis  we use comparative peer group data and qualitative factors  such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of loans exhibiting similar risk profiles to support our estimates 
for purposes of our analysis  we categorize our loans into one of five categories commercial and industrial  commercial real estate including construction  home equity lines of credit  residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
in the absence of meaningful historical loss factors  peer group loss factors are applied and are adjusted by the qualitative factors mentioned above 
the indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied to each of the five categories of loans 
in addition  we individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes  as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent 
since we have limited historical data on which to base loss factors for classified loans  we apply  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  a loss factor to all loans classified as special mention  a loss factor to all loans classified as substandard and a loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged off 
credit losses are an inherent part of our business and  although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are adequate  it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment 
additional provisions for such losses  if necessary  would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segment  as appropriate  and would negatively impact earnings 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we account for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended  which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the statement of condition at their fair values 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including rate lock commitments  to finance residential mortgage loans 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments  we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts 
during the rate lock commitment period  these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
 as amended 
changes in the fair values of loan commitments and changes in the fair values of forward sales contracts generally move in opposite directions and the net impact of the changes of these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential 
at the closing of the loan  the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract 
loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
prior to october   the changes in value of the forward loan sales contracts from the date the loan closed to the date it was sold to an investor were marked to market through earnings 
on october   we began designating our forward sales contracts as hedges to mitigate the variability in cash flow to be received from the sale of mortgage loans 
we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness 
we designate each forward loan sale agreement as a cash flow hedge of a specific loan held for sale 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the fair value adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income except for the ineffective portion which is recorded through the income statement 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in anticipated cash flows of the loans held for sale 
in situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable an anticipated loan sale will not occur  we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes 
new financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments an amendment of fasb statements and fas r 
this statement requires that companies recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 
it is required to be applied by us beginning january  this statement requires that stock awards be classified as either an equity award or a liability award 
equity classified awards are valued as of the grant date using either an observable market price or a valuation methodology 
liability classified awards are valued at fair value at each reporting date 
we will adopt fas r using the modified prospective application method which requires  among other things  that we recognize compensation cost for all awards outstanding at january  for which the requisite service has not been rendered 
we estimate that this new standard will result in an increase in pretax expense of approximately  in based on current stock options outstanding 
additional expense would be recorded for any future stock option grants 
on october   our board of directors authorized that any existing outstanding options that were or became underwater ie  their per share exercise price is greater than the market price before december  be amended to become fully vested 
this modification resulted in the immediate vesting of  stock options which were held by our employees 
the options that vested had exercise prices ranging from to 
on october   the market value of our common stock was 
this modification did not result in the recognition of expense in because the options had no intrinsic value at the grant date or on the date of modification 
vesting of these options was accelerated to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining fair value compensation expense associated with these options following the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the amount of compensation expense related to these options that would have been recognized in the financial statements after our implementation of sfas no

statements of operations net interest income margin net interest income is our primary source of revenue  representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
the level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates 
at the end of  the prime lending rate was at  its lowest level in over forty years 
during  as economic activity increased  the federal reserve raised the key federal funds rate six times to by year end 
the federal reserve continued this policy in  increasing the federal funds rate seven times to by year end 
the prime lending rate increased from at the end of to at the end of to at the end of see interest rate sensitivity for further information 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in net interest income was primarily a result of increases in the average volume of loans held for sale and loans receivable  net of the impact of increased funding costs during  compared with the increase in funding costs was primarily attributable to an increase in rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities 
net increases in loans held for sale and loans receivable were funded through the increases in total deposits and other borrowed funds 
our net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively  primarily as a result of a basis point increase in the rate earned on average interest earning assets partially offset by an increased cost of average interest bearing liabilities of basis points 
the average yield on interest earning assets increased to in from in  and our cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to in from in the cost of other borrowed funds  which generally are shorter term fundings and which we utilized in to help fund our balance sheet growth  increased basis points to in from in the cost of deposit liabilities increased basis points to in from for total earning assets increased by to billion at december   compared to billion at december  this resulted primarily from a million increase in loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs 
this increase was funded by deposit growth of million  or 
other borrowed funds decreased by million during to million at december   from million at december  average loans receivable increased million to million during from million in average balances of nonperforming assets  which consist of non accrual loans  are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in and additional interest income of approximately  for and  for would have been realized had all nonperforming assets performed as originally expected 
nonperforming assets exclude loans that are both past due days or more and still accruing interest due to an assessment of collectibility 
average total deposits increased million to million in from million in the largest increase in average deposit balances was experienced in certificates of deposit  which increased million compared to  a result of our branch expansion and increased advertising of our rates 
during  to assist in the funding of george mason s loans held for sale  we began using the brokered certificates of deposit market 
at december   we had million of brokered certificates of deposit 
at december   our brokered certificates of deposit decreased million to million 
as maturities in our brokered certificates of deposit portfolio occurred  we were able to replace that funding with increases in our core deposit products 
our utilization of the brokered certificates of deposit market averaged million in  a decrease of million from an average of million in net interest income was million for the year ended december   up million or from the increase was due primarily to an increase in average volumes of investment securities  loans held for sale and loans receivable  net of the impact of decreased yields during compared to these increases were funded through the increases in total deposits and other borrowed funds 
our net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin was a result of earning asset yields declining more quickly than the cost of interest bearing liabilities in the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to in from in  and our cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to in from in the yield on other borrowed funds  which are generally shorter term fundings and which we utilized to a greater extent in than as a result of the george mason acquisition  increased basis points to in december  compared to for total earning assets increased by to billion at december   compared to million at december  this resulted primarily from a million increase in loans held for sale as a result of our george mason acquisition and a million increase in loans receivable 
these increases were funded by deposit growth of million  or  and other borrowed funds and warehouse financing growth of million over december  balances 
in addition  other borrowed funds increased by million during to million at december   compared to million at december  average loans receivable increased million to million in from million in average balances of nonperforming assets are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in and additional interest income of approximately  in and  in would have been realized had all nonperforming assets performed as originally expected

interest income on non accruing loans was not material for the years presented 
we do not have investments that have tax benefit attributes  therefore  there are no tax equivalent adjustments to our net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk 
our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk 
management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain 
we manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee alco 
alco is responsible for managing the interest rate risk for the company in conjunction with liquidity and capital management 
in managing interest rate sensitivity  the alco committee until the third quarter of primarily used gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to determine the volume of interest sensitive assets less interest sensitive liabilities in various time intervals 
the difference is the interest sensitivity gap which indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
a negative gap  or liability sensitive position  exists when we have more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time frame than interest sensitive assets 
beginning with the interest rate sensitivity analysis for the third quarter of  and continuing through  we hired an independent consulting firm to model the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
instead of gap analysis  we began using a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity 
many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as now  money market  savings accounts and no penalty certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the current balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged 
this is considered the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were asset sensitive 
asset sensitive means that we had more assets maturing and repricing than liabilities 
we have a significant portion of our assets as floating rate assets and we have taken a significant amount of term funding through fixed rate  fixed term  certificates of deposit 
in a rising rate environment  net interest income should grow for an asset sensitive bank 
in the up basis point scenario  net interest income improves by not more than for the one year period compared to the base case and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
being asset sensitive  net interest income declines compared to the base case in the down basis point scenario 
at december   net interest income has a negative variance to the base case of less than for the one year period and a negative variance of less than over the cumulative two year period 
provision expense and allowance for loan losses our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million compared to million at december  our allowance for loan loss ratio at december  was compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is primarily reflective of a shift in the loan mix in our portfolio with a greater percentage of the overall loan portfolio comprised of lower risk residential real estate loans and an improvement in overall loan quality 
we continued to experience strong loan quality with annualized net charged off loans equal to to average loans receivable for the year ended december   and non performing loans equal to of total loans as of december  in and  the company purchased loan participations of approximately million from a bank in new orleans  louisiana  which represented approximately loans 
at december   the total remaining balances on these participations were approximately million and represented approximately loans secured by various types of recreational vehicles

hurricane and other weather related problems have disrupted the operations of the new orleans bank  temporarily curtailed mail delivery and other communications in the area and caused widespread destruction in the gulf coast region

business segment operations in  we operated and reported in two business segments  commercial banking and investment services 
as of july   we began operating in a third business segment  mortgage banking  with the completion of its acquisition of george mason 
the commercial banking segment includes both commercial and consumer lending and provides customers such products as commercial loans  real estate loans  and other business financing and consumer loans 
in addition  this segment also provides customers with various deposit products including demand deposit accounts  savings accounts and certificates of deposit 
the mortgage banking segment engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis

our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence 
regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution

we must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non cash items to cash 
the objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient liquid resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position 
we believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations  personal service and pricing 
in addition to deposits  we have access to the different wholesale funding markets 
these markets include the brokered cd market  the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market 
we maintain secured lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding 
cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers 
we have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management 
for our liquidity management program  we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet 
in this forecast  we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion 
we also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios 
guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established 
in addition  one stress test combines all other stress tests to see how liquidity would react to several negative scenarios occurring at the same time 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs 
george mason and the bank have a million floating rate revolving credit and security agreement with a third party 
the purpose of this credit facility is to fund residential mortgage loans made by george mason prior to their sale into the secondary market 
the credit facility requires  among other things  that george mason and the bank have positive quarterly net income and maintain specified minimum tangible and regulatory net worth levels 
the company has guaranteed repayment of this debt 
the interest rate on this credit facility is libor plus between and 
at december   none of this line was utilized 
in addition to this facility  this same lender has also provided a million facility that is utilized by george mason to warehouse residential mortgage loans held for sale to this lender 
the terms of this facility are substantially the same as the above referenced revolving credit and security agreement and the cost of this facility is netted against interest earned on the loans pending settlement with the lender 
loans under this credit facility are considered sold when financed 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale totaled million at december   or of total assets 
we held investments that are classified as held to maturity in the amount of million at december  to maintain ready access to the bank s secured lines of credit  the bank has pledged the majority of its securities to the federal home loan bank of atlanta with additional securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of richmond 
additional borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of atlanta at december  was approximately million 
borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of richmond was approximately million at december  george mason has million of lines of credit available 
we anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
contractual obligations we have entered into a number of long term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities 
these contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us 
the required payments under such obligations were as follows contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta trust preferred securities operating lease obligations total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and credit risk we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we hold certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary

these errors related primarily to the following loans held for sale by george mason at the date of acquisition were reported as a use of cash loans acquired in operating activities  rather than as a noncash investing activity  cash paid to acquire the membership interests in george mason was reported as a use of cash in operating activities increase in goodwill rather than as a use of cash in investing activities  and post acquisition repayments of the warehouse line of credit financing of george mason that were assumed by the company at the date of acquisition were not reported in financing activities 
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended september  has been restated to reclassify these items 
the reclassifications had no effect on the company s consolidated statements of condition or income for the effects of the reclassifications are summarized as follows as reported as restated cash flows from operating activities loans held for sale originated increase decrease in accrued interest receivable  other assets  and deferred tax asset decrease in accrued interest payable  escrow liabilities and other liabilities net cash used in operating activities cash flows from investing activities purchase of premises and equipment net cash paid acquired in acquisition net increase in loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs net cash used in investing activities cash flows from financing activities repayments of warehouse financing assumed in acquisition net cash provided by financing activities item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing our liquidity requirements and maximizing our net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
interest rate risk arises because the assets of the bank and the liabilities of the bank have different maturities and characteristics 
in order to measure this interest rate risk  we use a simulation process that measures the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
this model is run for the bank by an independent consulting firm that was hired by the bank in the fourth quarter of the simulations incorporate assumptions related to expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are developed for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as now  money market  savings accounts and no penalty certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the most recent period end balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that interest rates remain unchanged 
this becomes the base case 
next  the model determines the impact on net interest income given specified changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually increased by basis points in the first year and remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were asset sensitive 
asset sensitive means that we had more assets maturing or repricing than liabilities 
we have a significant portion of our assets as floating rate assets and we have also taken a significant amount of term funding through fixed rate  fixed term  certificates of deposit 
in a rising rate environment  net interest income should grow for an asset sensitive bank 
in the up basis point scenario  net interest income improves by not more than for one year compared to the base case and by not more than over the two year cumulative time horizon 
being an asset sensitive bank  net interest income declines compared to the base case in the down basis point simulation by less than for one year and by over the cumulative two year period 
see also interest rate sensitivity in item above for a discussion of our interest rate risk
