item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  particularly note of notes to consolidated financial statements which presents net sales and revenues and operating income by reportable segment 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclosed in the related notes thereto 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management s estimates 
management believes the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates are based upon management s historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue transactions involving the sale of homes  real estate  products and commodities are recorded when title to the goods is transferred 
interest income on instalment notes is recognized using the interest method 
instalment notes receivable are initially recorded at the discounted value of the future instalment note payments using an imputed interest rate which represents the estimated prevailing market rate of interest for credit of similar terms issued to customers with similar credit ratings to homebuilding s customers 
the company estimates this rate by adding a credit spread and a margin to a benchmark funding rate in order to cover costs and expected losses 
this rate is periodically compared to rates charged by competitors and other lenders to customers of similar credit quality to validate that the methodology results in a market rate of interest 
these estimates affect revenue recognition by determining the allocation of income between the amount recognized by the homebuilding segment from the construction of the home and the amount recognized by the financing segment over the life of the instalment note as interest income 
variations in the estimated market rate of interest used to initially record the instalment notes receivable could affect the amount and timing of income recognition in each of these segments 
allowances for losses allowances for losses on trade and other accounts receivable are based  in large part  upon judgments and estimates of expected losses and specific identification of problem trade accounts and other receivables 
significantly weaker than anticipated industry or economic conditions could impact customers ability to pay or could impact the value of underlying collateral such that actual losses are greater than the amounts provided for in these allowances 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on instalment notes is based on the company s past loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  delinquencies  the estimated value of the underlying real estate collateral and current economic and market conditions within the applicable geographic areas surrounding the underlying real estate 
the allowance for losses on instalment notes and mortgage loans is increased by provisions for losses charged to income and is reduced by charge offs net of recoveries 
inventory valuation inventories are periodically evaluated for indications of excess and obsolete exposure based upon anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels and ultimate product sales value 
if necessary  an adjustment for losses related to inventory values is recognized 
this evaluation of inventory values is based on management s estimation of market conditions relating to both pricing and anticipated sales volumes for the company s products 
employee benefits the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions used in developing the required estimates including the following key factors discount rate salary growth retirement rates mortality rates healthcare cost trends expected return on plan assets pension benefits other benefits december  december  december  december  weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase assumed healthcare cost trend rates healthcare cost trend rate assumed for the next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate the discount rate used to determine pension and other post retirement expense was decreased to for from used in the rate of return on plan assets used to determine pension expense is for both and the discount rate is based on a proprietary bond defeasance model designed by the plans investment consultant to create a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds which  if invested on the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay accumulated benefits when due 
the premise of the model is that annual benefit obligations are funded from the cash flows generated from periodic bond coupon payments  principal maturities  and the interest on excess cash flows  ie carry forward balances 
the carry forward balance in year equals the present value of benefit obligations in years and later 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and healthcare plans 
a one percentage point change in the rate for each of these assumptions would have the following effects in thousands percentage percentage point increase point decrease healthcare cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation effect on current year postretirement expense effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense the company also has significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims  discount factors  benefit increases and mortality rates 
pursuant to the terms of the tyco purchase agreement  mueller water is indemnified by tyco for all liabilities that occurred prior to august  workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience  changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
the company applies a discount rate at a risk free interest rate  generally a us treasury bill rate  for each policy year 
the rate used is one with a duration that corresponds to the weighted average expected payout period for each policy year 
once a discount rate is applied to a policy year  it remains the discount rate for the year until all claims are paid 
the use of this method decreases the volatility of the liability as impacted by changes in the discount rate 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted workers compensation liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
litigation  investigations and claims the company is involved in litigation  investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of its business  including those relating to commercial transactions  as well as environmental  health and safety matters 
the company estimates and accrues its liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors  including outstanding legal claims and proposed settlements  assessments by internal counsel of pending or threatened litigation  and assessments of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs 
the company believes it has adequately accrued for these potential liabilities  however  facts and circumstances may change that could cause the actual liabilities to exceed the estimates  or that may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues 
the company believes that its tax filing positions have substantial merit and it intends to vigorously defend these positions 
the company has established accruals that it feels are sufficient to address claims  including related interest and penalties  where its defense may be unsuccessful or where a settlement of issues may be warranted 
the amount of the accrual is based on an assessment by management of both the probability and extent of loss for each of the disputed issues involved 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management s estimate of this liability could change 
accruals for property liability claims and claims expense are the estimated amounts necessary to settle both reported and unreported claims of insured property liability losses  based upon the facts in each case and the company s experience with similar cases 
the establishment of appropriate accruals  including accruals for catastrophes such hurricanes  is an inherently uncertain process 
accrual estimates are regularly reviewed and updated using the most current information available 
reserves for catastrophic uninsured losses at plant or mine facilities would be made on an ad hoc basis based on relevant facts and circumstances 
environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and because conditions giving rise to obligations and liabilities under environmental laws are in some circumstances not readily identifiable  it is difficult to forecast the amount of such future environmental expenditures or the effects of changing standards on future business operations or results 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and intangibles long lived assets  including goodwill and intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are also reviewed for possible impairment at least annually 
the company uses estimates of future cash flows of the related asset  asset grouping or reporting unit in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
changes in actual or estimated future cash flows could have an impact on the recoverability of such assets  resulting in future impairment charges 
restructuring charges the company occasionally records restructuring costs associated with manufacturing plant and mine closings and other exit activities 
these costs are estimated by management based on factors such as projected timing and duration of transitions  the amount and timing of termination benefits and the amount and timing of related contract exit costs 
during the restructuring process  management reviews the estimates of restructuring costs and adjusts them if necessary given current economic conditions

the results of mueller and anvil are included from the date of acquisition on october  year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  overview the company s net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which compares to million  or per diluted share in the prior year period 
principal factors impacting net income in the current year results compared to the prior year period include as discussed further in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company acquired mueller water products  inc mueller water on october  for million and the assumption of billion of debt 
on a combined basis  the mueller water segments  mueller and anvil  reported an operating loss of million  representing the results of mueller water s operations since the october  date of acquisition 
these results include the recognition of million in cost of sales of basis adjustments to inventory due to the allocation of the million purchase price and intangible amortization expenses of million 
a goodwill impairment charge of million  pre tax  was recognized at homebuilding during  reducing that segment s goodwill to zero 
industrial products results include million in charges related to the announced closure of us pipe s chattanooga  tennessee plant and the transfer of the valve and hydrant production operations of that plant to mueller water s chattanooga  tennessee and albertville  alabama plants 
other interest expense increased by million primarily due to mueller water debt assumed and additional indebtedness incurred to finance the mueller water acquisition 
natural resources incurred million of idle mine costs in due to a water ingress problem at mine no 
and adverse geological conditions in mine no 
financing results include a million provision for estimated hurricane insurance losses in  compared to million in average selling prices at natural resources for coal and natural gas increased and  respectively  in compared to price increases of in industrial products us pipe more than offset cost increases in scrap metal  transportation and other manufacturing costs

the million goodwill impairment charge was largely not deductible for tax purposes  with a small related tax benefit of million recognized 
this compares with when the company recognized a favorable benefit from the reversal of certain valuation allowances related to state deferred income tax assets previously provided in the amount of million  partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances of million reserved for certain other state deferred income tax assets 
other strategic initiatives in  the company announced its plan to undertake an initial public offering ipo and spin off of its water products business 
the ipo is expected to take place during the first half of  with a subsequent spin off to the company s shareholders of the company s remaining stake in its water products business which is expected to be a tax free distribution of shares not earlier than six months after the ipo 
on february   the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement on form s registration no 
for this proposed initial public offering of the water products business 
the registration has not yet been declared effective 
in connection with the creation of the water products business during  the company developed an integration plan designed to achieve synergy benefits 
the company expects operating income synergies from integrating mueller  anvil and us pipe of million to million annually  which are expected to be realized on a run rate basis within the next two years 
in addition to the exit costs for the closure of the us pipe chattanooga plant discussed below  the company expects to expend a total of approximately million of cash in and primarily for severance benefits and capital expenditures to achieve this synergy benefit 
in february  the company announced that it is evaluating the spin off of its homebuilding and financing segments to the company s shareholders 
consolidated results of operations net sales and revenues for the year ended december  were billion  including revenue from the mueller and anvil segments of million 
excluding mueller and anvil  revenue grew by million  or 
increased revenue at natural resources  industrial products and sloss in the other segment were partially offset by decreased revenue at homebuilding and financing 
natural resources revenue increased primarily due to price increases for coal and natural gas  partially offset by decreased coal and natural gas sales volumes 
industrial products revenue increased primarily due to price increases implemented during the year designed to keep pace with the rising costs of scrap metal and other materials 
homebuilding revenue decreased due to lower unit completions  partially offset by higher average selling prices 
financing revenue declined primarily due to a declining portfolio as a result of fewer note originations from the homebuilding segment and lower prepayment related interest income 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  of billion was of net sales in versus billion  or of net sales in the current year s cost of sales included million at mueller and anvil 
the gross margin percentage improved as compared to because of increases in sales prices in natural resources  industrial products and at sloss  partially offset by million of charges recognized as cost of sales related to the chattanooga plant closure in the industrial products segment and higher lumber costs and job cost overruns in the homebuilding segment 
however  gross margins decreased due to million of purchase accounting related inventory step up costs at mueller and anvil 
in addition  natural resources incurred million of idle mine costs in due to a water ingress problem at mine no 
and adverse geological conditions in mine no 
 both of which were resolved in the fourth quarter 
although pension expense was not a significant driver of results in as compared to  in  the company expects its pension expense to be million as compared to million in the increase in anticipated pension expense is due to i the effect of a full year of mueller water results in  ii a termination benefit charge related to the us pipe chattanooga plant closure and iii the effect of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the liability  from to

selling  general and administrative expenses of million  including million from the mueller and anvil segments  were of net sales and revenues in compared to million  or in decreased selling  general and administrative expense  excluding the effect of mueller and anvil  were due to i a decrease of million at homebuilding related primarily to lower advertising  construction overhead and legal fees  ii a decrease at financing of million  primarily due to lower property taxes and legal fees  iii a decrease of million in the industrial products segment  primarily due to a favorable insurance settlement of million recognized in  and iv a decrease at natural resources of million  primarily due to lower legal expenses incurred in  since included legal expenses related to an accident at mine no 
provision for losses on instalment notes decreased to million in  compared to million in due to lower volume and improved recovery rates on sales of repossessed homes  partially offset by million provided in due to estimated losses resulting from the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita 
postretirement benefits expense increased to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to a lower discount rate used to measure the liability and related actuarially determined expenses recognized in in  the company expects its postretirement benefits expense to be million 
the increase from is due to the effect of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the liability  partially offset by a curtailment gain to be recognized in related to the us pipe chattanooga plant closure 
interest expense for mortgage backed and asset backed notes decreased to million in  compared to million in primarily due to a decline in the instalment note portfolio balance as a result of fewer note originations from the homebuilding segment 
interest expense on other debt increased million to million in due to mueller water debt assumed and additional indebtedness incurred to finance the mueller water acquisition 
amortization of intangibles increased to million in from million in  due to million of acquisition related amortization of technology and customer relationship intangibles at mueller and anvil in the provision for estimated hurricane insurance losses was million in  compared to million in the increase in estimated losses was due to both the severity of hurricane katrina and the resulting impact on mississippi  which is a large market for insurance policies underwritten by the financing segment 
restructuring and impairment charges were million in and included a million goodwill impairment charge at homebuilding  a million charge at industrial products due to the us pipe chattanooga plant closure and million at natural resources due to a small impairment for a mine no 
longwall shield  partially offset by slightly reduced mine no 
shutdown costs 
the company s effective tax rate of in differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to non deductible goodwill charges  partially offset by the favorable effect of depletion deductions related to the company s mining operations 
the company s effective tax rate of in differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a net reversal of a valuation allowance provided for in previous years and due to the favorable effect of depletion deductions 
see also note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the current and prior year results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis homebuilding net sales and revenues were million during  a decrease of million  as a result of fewer unit completions  partially offset by a increase in average net selling prices 
the higher average net selling prices reflect the increasing popularity of larger homes with more amenities as well as price increases to offset higher material costs 
partially offsetting these increases  the average selling prices of the homebuilding segment s modular product declined by an average of  per unit  reflecting the introduction of a new  lower priced product line in the first half of this product line was discontinued in the fourth quarter of when it was determined that it would not achieve profitability objectives 
the decline in unit completions from the prior year reflects weaker market conditions in the company s affordable housing market segment compared to the broader homebuilding industry 
the decline in unit completions was comprised of a decline in stick built units  partially offset by an increase of modular unit completions 
for the year ended december  homes completed stick built modular average net selling price stick built modular the segment reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
this decline was primarily due to a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of to write off goodwill  as a result of the company s annual impairment testing 
this write off eliminated all of the homebuilding segment s goodwill from the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this adjustment was necessary to properly reflect the fair value of homebuilding  which has been generating losses during the last few years 
excluding the goodwill write off  homebuilding segment operating results declined by million in this decline reflects lower unit completions and lower margins  partially offset by higher average selling prices and lower selling  general and administrative expenses compared with the prior year 
the decline in margins reflects costs in related to repairs and rework on aged units under construction 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses in reflects lower overhead costs resulting from the closure of unprofitable model home parks between the third quarter of and second quarter of and lower advertising expenses 
in an effort to return the segment to profitability  homebuilding management has re established accountability for the profitable performance of each branch operation with local managers and has supported that focus with internal training initiatives meant to improve managers understanding of their operations contribution to the success of the overall homebuilding segment 
to enhance this initiative  compensation programs have been re designed to align compensation with the achievement of branch level profitability objectives 
in addition  programs involving the streamlining of product offerings and simplification of front end sales and financing processes have been instituted with the expectation of improving cycle times and staff productivity  while at the same time improving product quality and customer satisfaction 
financing net sales and revenues were million in  a decrease of million from this decrease is attributable to a declining portfolio as a result of fewer note originations from the homebuilding segment and lower prepayment related interest income 
operating income was million in  compared to million in the segment results declined primarily as a result of lower instalment note revenues on a declining portfolio  a million incremental provision for estimated hurricane related losses and a million impact from incremental loan losses expected to result from customers in hurricane impacted areas 
delinquencies the percentage of amounts outstanding over days past due were at december   up from at december  primarily due to customer payment disruptions caused by the hurricanes 
financing expects instalment notes  related debt balances and corresponding interest income and expense to decrease due to delivered on your lot unit declines at homebuilding  which is expected to be partially offset by continued purchases of seasoned mortgages 
mueller mueller s results are included from the date of acquisition  october  mueller s net sales and revenues for the period ended december  of million reflect strong valve and hydrant volumes and increased selling prices of mueller s butterfly valves  hydrants and brass products compared to its prior year 
mueller s operating loss for the period ended december  was million 
mueller s results include million of basis adjustments to inventory due to the allocation of the purchase price recognized as those products were sold and million of acquisition related amortization expense 
excluding these purchase accounting related charges  mueller s operating income of million was driven by strong volumes and improved valve and hydrant margins 
anvil anvil s results are included from the date of acquisition  october  anvil s net sales and revenues for the period ended december  of million reflect continued strength in the oilfield and mechanical markets for grooved and hanger products and growth in the sales of foreign sourced products 
anvil s operating loss for the period ended december  was million 
anvil s results include million of basis adjustments to inventory due to the allocation of the purchase price recognized as those products were sold and million of acquisition related amortization expense 
excluding these purchase accounting related charges  anvil s operating income was million 
industrial products net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a increase in ductile iron pipe selling prices  partially offset by a decrease in ductile iron pipe shipments  mainly due to industry wide delays in construction projects 
prices were higher than the prior year as the industry has been increasing sales prices to mitigate the negative effect of surging scrap costs over the same period 
at this time  it appears that over the last two years  scrap costs have reached a new  less volatile equilibrium which may or may not continue 
operating income was million in  compared to million in current year results include million in charges related to the announced closure of us pipe s chattanooga  tennessee plant and transfer of the valve and hydrant production operations of that plant to mueller water s chattanooga  tennessee and albertville  alabama plants 
included in the million of charges are million of non cash asset impairment write offs  million of non cash inventory obsolescence due to the decision to discontinue certain us pipe valve and hydrant products and components  million of unabsorbed overhead costs due to the winding down of the facility and million of severance and other plant closure costs 
additional costs of million  primarily pension expense net of a postretirement curtailment benefit  are expected to be expensed during as a result of closing this facility 
as a result of this plant closure  annual benefits will begin in and ramp up to an ongoing benefit of million that are expected to be fully realized in these benefits include increased margins on the transfer of valve and hydrant production to mueller water  decreased personnel and much lower expenses 
excluding these charges  operating income improved by million in as compared to this profit improvement in was primarily attributable to higher ductile iron pipe pricing  improved plant performance  favorable product mix  a million environmental settlement in and higher recoveries from environmental settlements  partially offset by higher manufacturing and material costs and lower volumes 
natural resources net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million in the increase was primarily due to higher metallurgical coal and natural gas prices  partially offset by decreased coal and natural gas volumes 
for the year ended december  average coal selling price per ton tons of coal sold in millions average natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells the average natural gas selling prices as indicated in the table above for and include the effects of approximately million of losses and million of gains  respectively  on hedges of anticipated natural gas production and sales 
strong performance at natural resources continued in as previously expected 
increased worldwide demand  particularly from china  for metallurgical coal as well as reduced supply  has contributed to price increases in the world s metallurgical coal markets 
in  natural resources produced million tons of coal  which is million tons lower than primarily due to a water ingress problem at mine no 
that occurred during the second half of and adverse geological conditions in mine no 
the water ingress problem at mine no 
was rectified in the fourth quarter of and operations resumed to full capacity in december  while new and much stronger longwall equipment was deployed at mine no 
in the fourth quarter of  which was specifically designed to alleviate continued unfavorable geological conditions at mine no 
for  natural resources operating income was million  compared to million in the increase was due to higher metallurgical coal and natural gas sales prices and reduced legal expenses incurred versus the prior year  partially offset by lower metallurgical coal volumes and lower gas volumes and million of idle mine costs in due to a water ingress problem at mine no 
and adverse geological conditions in mine no 
 both of which were resolved in the fourth quarter in december  the company announced that it had approved a capital investment program to increase coal production capacity at mine no 
it is anticipated that the development of the program will occur over a four year period and increase annual production capacity by approximately million tons in and and million tons per year thereafter 
capital expenditures through december  related to this expansion project amounted to million and are expected to be approximately million in  the company decided to extend its coal production schedule for mine no 
into the fourth quarter of due to favorable metallurgical coal pricing 
as a result of the temporary idling of mine no 
and the increased manpower requirements related to an expansion program at mine no 
 the company anticipates terminating fewer mine no 
employees than previously estimated 
as a result  total expected costs decreased to approximately million  of which million would qualify as restructuring costs 
the remainder of the costs  primarily representing estimated workers compensation and other incremental costs related to the closure of the mine will be charged to expense when incurred 
during  the company re measured the liability  which resulted in a million net reversal of amounts previously charged to restructuring expense within the natural resources segment 
estimated expected costs associated with the shutdown and the amounts recorded to restructuring expenses are as follows in thousands total expected costs restructuring and impairment expenses recognized from inception to december  termination benefits other employee related costs other costs total in  jim walter resources expects to mine approximately million tons of coal  including million tons at mine no 
and million tons from the mine no

in addition  kodiak  an underground coal mine in shelby county  alabama owned by united land  is expected to mine a total of million tons of steam coal in of which will belong to the company 
the company is also evaluating surface mining opportunities on company owned land 
other net sales and revenues were million for compared to million in sloss revenue was million above and land sales were million better than sloss revenue increased in due to higher prices for furnace and foundry coke  which increased and  respectively  over the prior year  partially offset by a decline in shipments of foundry coke 
sloss operating income was million higher than the previous year due to the favorable effect of increased sales prices  partially offset by increased coal and other costs

selling  general and administrative expenses of million were of net sales and revenues in  compared to million and in an increase of million in the homebuilding segment related primarily to costs incurred to remodel and close branches and for higher insurance  employee related  consulting and legal costs 
the increase of million in the financing segment was due to higher employee related and legal costs 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease at industrial products due to a legal settlement expensed in which was partially offset by current year environmental charges 
the increase of million in the natural resources segment was primarily due to increased legal expenses associated with a mine no 
accident and increased employee related costs 
corporate expenses increased million mainly due to increased employee related costs  plus higher internal and external audit and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
provision for losses on instalment notes decreased to million in  compared to million in due to improved recovery rates on sales of repossessed homes

the company recorded approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges during related to the cessation of various operations in the industrial products segment  the anticipated closure of mine no 
in the natural resources segment  and a write down of the company s former headquarters building to its net realizable value prior to its sale 
the provision for estimated hurricane losses in of million relates to estimated claims incurred by insurance customers of the company s financing segment from four major hurricanes that impacted the southeastern united states during the third quarter 
the company s effective tax rate for and differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to depletion deductions related to the company s mining operations and the effect of state income taxes 
additionally  the company had a net reduction of valuation allowances of million related to deferred state income tax assets in the tax rate also differed from the statutory tax rate due to a reduction of income tax accruals as a result of the favorable settlement of a dispute with the irs 
in connection with the irs dispute settlement  the company recorded reductions of million and million to interest expense and income taxes  respectively  in the statement of operations 
the and results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis homebuilding net sales and revenues were million during  a decrease of million  or from as a result of fewer unit completions  partially offset by higher average selling prices 
the higher selling price reflect price increases implemented in the first half of  as well as the company s on going strategy to market and sell larger homes with more amenities 
total unit completions decreased by or  compared to  as a result of lower volumes of new sales orders beginning in the last half of this reduction was due to a variety of factors  including reduced advertising and promotional initiatives 
additionally  during the third quarter of  a series of hurricanes and the resulting excessive rain caused construction delays  which reduced new starts and completions through much of the southeast 
this reduction also reflects market conditions that were weaker in the company s historical affordable housing market segment compared to the broader homebuilding industry 
excluding the modular business   units were completed in  compared to  in the modular business completed homes in  fewer than this reduction reflects a weak economic environment in the carolinas  the market area served by this business 
for the year ended december  homes completed average net selling price the segment operating loss was million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million in this decrease was primarily due to fewer unit completions million  reduced margins primarily due to higher job and lumber costs million  increases in payroll costs million related to market adjustments to salaries  severance related to more than eliminated positions and a change in the commission structure 
additionally  other costs  primarily other employee costs increased million in compared to primarily related to hiring experienced industry personnel  consulting expenses  legal expenses and the closure of twenty six branches 
the homebuilding segment instituted one price increase in the fourth quarter of and two price increases in in response to rising lumber and other costs 
the first of these increases was effective october  and increased prices  the second was effective march  and increased prices and the third increase of was effective may  financing net sales and revenues were million in  an increase of million from this increase is attributable to higher prepayment related interest income and higher property insurance revenues

liquidity and capital resources overview the company s principal sources of short term funding are operating cash flows and borrowings under revolving credit facilities and committed secured warehouse lines of credit 
the company s principal sources of long term funding are its senior bank debt  public notes and its financings under mortgage backed asset backed notes 
the company believes that  based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions  sufficient operating cash flow will be generated to meet substantially all operating needs  to make planned capital expenditures and to make all required principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
however  the company s operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors  including the general economy and  in particular  prices of coal and gas  levels of construction activity  levels of government spending on water projects  costs of raw materials and interest rates 
as of december   total indebtedness has increased by approximately billion compared to december   resulting from the billion of proceeds from senior bank financing described below and the inclusion of mueller water s senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes

the mueller credit agreement and senior subordinated notes described below are obligations of mueller group and impose limitations on its ability to pay dividends to mueller water 
for example  the senior subordinated notes limit the amount of restricted payments  including dividends  that mueller group can make 
generally  under the terms of the senior subordinated notes  mueller group can pay dividends only if its fixed charge coverage ratio as defined therein is to or better and only from an amount equal to of its cumulative net income as defined therein since january  however  regardless of these restrictions  mueller group can pay dividends under these notes of up to million per year for holding company expenses and to fund payments in respect of taxes made pursuant to tax sharing agreements 
mueller group s ability to generate net income will depend upon various factors that may be beyond our control 
accordingly  mueller group may not generate sufficient cash flow or be permitted by the terms of its debt to pay dividends or distributions to mueller water in amounts sufficient to allow mueller water to pay cash interest on mueller water s outstanding indebtedness or to satisfy our other cash needs 
mueller water would then be required to secure alternate financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all

statement of cash flows cash was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in cash is primarily the result of increased cash flows from operations and increased net borrowings  partially offset by cash used to fund the acquisition of mueller water and to make capital expenditures 
cash flows provided by continuing operations for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flows provided by continuing operations was principally due to increased income as adjusted for non cash charges for restructuring and impairment of million and a million decrease in net working capital  excluding cash

on october   the company and mueller group entered into credit agreements as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements with total term loan borrowings of billion and floating rate interest rates based on libor plus a spread 
on october   mueller group entered into six interest rate hedge agreements swaps with a cumulative notional value of million as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the swap terms are between one and seven years with five separate counter parties 
the objective of the swaps is to protect the mueller group against rising libor interest rates that would have a negative effect on the mueller group s cash flows due to changes in interest payments on its mueller credit agreement 
the swaps call for the mueller group to make fixed rate payments over the term at each swap s stated libor rate and to receive payments based on the three month libor rate from the counter parties 
it is anticipated that these swaps will be settled upon maturity  and they are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the changes in the fair value of these swaps that take place through the date of maturity will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  mueller group has two interest rate hedge agreements swaps with a cumulative notional value of million that existed as of october  when acquired by the company a million two year libor swap that matures in may and a million two year libor swap that matures in april the changes in fair value of these two swaps were recorded immediately as interest expense until achieving hedge effectiveness in october and november  respectively  at which times such changes in fair value will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

restricted short term investments of million at december  are invested primarily in commercial paper maintaining a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a decrease in interest rates would result in a reduction of annual pre tax interest income by approximately million 
the company s fixed rate gross instalment notes receivables were billion and fixed rate mortgage backed asset backed notes were billion as of december  the fixed rate nature of these instruments and their offsetting positions effectively mitigate significant interest rate risk exposure from these instruments 
if interest rates decrease  the company may be exposed to higher prepayment speeds 
this could result in a modest increase in short term profitability 
however  it could adversely impact long term profitability as a result of a shrinking portfolio 
changes in interest rates may impact the fair value of these financial instruments 
the level of prepayments on the fixed rate instalment notes will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
income generated from prepayments will vary each period based on the current interest rate environment and the interest rates associated with the outstanding instalment notes 
commodity risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is also exposed to commodity price risk primarily related to the acquisition of raw materials 
availability and the cost of raw materials may have a significant influence over the revenues and costs of the company 
costs potentially having a significant influence on the company include costs for lumber and other building materials  natural gas  scrap metal and steel  iron  brass ingot  sand and resin 
historically  the company has been able to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and does not anticipate any shortage of these materials 
the company generally purchases raw materials at spot prices but may  from time to time  enter into commodity derivatives to reduce exposure to fluctuation in the price of raw materials 
the company is exposed to commodity price risk on sales and purchases of natural gas 
on an annual basis  the company s sales of natural gas  net of purchases  approximates seven million mmbtu s 
the company occasionally utilizes derivative commodity instruments to manage certain of these exposures where considered practical to do so 
such derivative instruments are structured as cash flow hedges and not for trading 
during and  the company hedged approximately and  respectively of its natural gas production with swap contracts 
these swap contracts effectively converted a portion of forecasted sales at floating rate natural gas prices to a fixed rate basis 
these swap contracts resulted in cash outflows of million in and cash inflows of million in  impacting net sales and revenues 
at december   swap contracts to hedge anticipated sales in of natural gas totaling million mmbtu were outstanding as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company recorded a net unrealized loss from these hedging agreements of million  net of tax  as a component of other comprehensive income loss

on january   us pipe entered into a swap contract to hedge anticipated purchases from february through march totaling million mmbtu  or approximately of expected natural gas consumption  at a price of per mmbtu 
this swap contract effectively converts a portion of forecasted purchases at market prices to a fixed rate basis
