item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in thousands  except per share data results of operations for the years ended december    and overview our primary business is the construction and sale of single family detached homes  townhomes and condominium buildings 
to fully serve our homebuilding customers  we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business 
we primarily conduct our operations in mature supply constrained markets 
additionally  we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets 
we currently operate in the following regions washington washington  dc metropolitan area and adjacent counties in maryland  virginia and west virginia baltimore baltimore  md metropolitan area and adjacent counties in pennsylvania north delaware  kentucky  maryland eastern shore  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio and pennsylvania south north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and richmond  va we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy 
we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a pre sold basis 
this strategy allows us to maximize inventory turnover  which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital  thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 
in addition  we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve 
this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets  which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 
because we are not active in the land development business  our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build  and on our developers ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers 
timely delivery of lots by our developers can be influenced by many factors  such as the developer s execution of improvements  weather related impacts  and the length of time necessary to obtain governmental approval of projects 
we have been impacted in the past year and may be negatively impacted in the future by development delays 
we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements purchase agreements 
these purchase agreements require deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement 
however  we believe that this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development 
as of december   we controlled approximately  lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately  and  respectively 
we also controlled approximately  lots through investments in joint venture limited liability corporations 
consolidated revenues and net income for increased and  respectively  from the increase in net income coupled with our continuing share repurchase program resulted in a increase in diluted earnings per share in compared to the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by our homebuilding business where we experienced an increase in the number of homes settled and a increase in the average settlement price in from in addition  the value of homes in backlog at december  exceeded the december  backlog value by 
homebuilding segment the following tables summarizes homebuilding settlements  new orders and backlog activity by region for each of the last three years year ended december  settlements washington baltimore north south total average settlement price new orders washington baltimore north south total average new order price year ended december  backlog washington baltimore north south total average backlog price the following table summarizes the results of operations for each of the last three years for our homebuilding segment year ended december  revenues cost of sales gross profit margin percentage selling  general and administrative expenses revenues homebuilding revenues for increased from  primarily as a result of a increase in the average settlement price and an increase in the number of homes settled 
each of these increases was driven by a stronger backlog  both in value and units  at the beginning of as compared to the beginning of due to the company s overall growth and our ability to raise prices year over year during a period of strong housing demand 
we experienced increased home settlements year over year in each of our regions except baltimore where settlements declined slightly from the prior year 
settlements in the baltimore region were negatively affected by development delays throughout the first three quarters of the baltimore region was able to resolve several of these development delays in the fourth quarter  and settlements for this region increased in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in homebuilding revenues for increased from  primarily as a result of a increase in the average settlement price to in from in and an increase of in the number of homes settled to  in from  in the increase in average settlement prices was primarily attributable to a higher average price of homes in backlog entering as compared to and to a increase in the average price of homes sold during the first six months of as compared to the same period in the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to an higher backlog at the beginning of as compared to the beginning of new orders the number of new orders for increased from  and the value of new orders for increased to  from  in the increase in the number of new orders was primarily attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active communities to in as compared to in strong new order growth was experienced in each of our regions except the washington region  which remained relatively flat with the prior year 
sales in the washington region were negatively impacted by lower sales absorption during the second half of the year as compared to the same period in as a result of generally weaker market conditions within the region 
the increase in the value of new orders was attributable to both the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and sustained housing demand year over year  which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices  resulting in an increase in the average selling price in as compared to the number of new orders for increased from  while the value of new orders for increased to  from  in the increase in the number of new orders was attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active communities to in as compared to in increases year over year in new orders in the washington  north and south regions were offset partially by a decrease in new orders for the baltimore region 
this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average number of active communities in the baltimore region year over year  attributable primarily to development delays 
the increase in the value of new orders was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and strong housing demand which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices  resulting in a increase in the average selling price in as compared to gross profit the increase in gross profit margins of basis points in from was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in average settlement prices year over year 
these increases were partially offset by higher land and building commodity prices in as compared to many of the end product building supplies used in our construction operations are impacted by higher  more volatile energy and petroleum costs  including osb sheathing  siding material  pvc piping  paint  asphalt  shingles  cement  gypsum  steel  glass and insulation 
we are actively engaged in managing these cost increases to minimize their potential margin impact 
however  gross margins in future periods may be adversely impacted by these higher costs  as well as expected pricing pressures in in many of our markets 
gross profit margins for increased to compared to for the increase in profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions allowing us to increase sales prices in a majority of the markets leading to the aforementioned increase in average settlement prices in as compared to these increases were partially offset by higher land  lumber and other commodity prices in as compared to selling  general and administrative sg a sg a for increased  or from  and as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in the increase in sg a costs was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately  and  respectively 
personnel costs have increased primarily as a result of increased wages and management incentive compensation due to increased staffing levels to support our growth strategy 
as of december   sg a staffing levels had increased approximately from december  the increase in selling and marketing costs were attributable to an increase in advertising and selling support costs due to the aforementioned increase in the average number of active communities year over year 
sg a costs in will be negatively impacted as a result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no

backlog backlog units and dollars were  and  respectively  at december  compared to backlog units of  and dollars of  at december  the increase in backlog units was due primarily to a increase in the number of new orders for the six month period ended december  as compared to the same period ended december  the increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the increase in backlog units and a increase in the average price of new orders for the six month period ended december  as compared to the same period in backlog units and dollars were  and  respectively  at december  compared to backlog units of  and dollars of  at december  the increase in backlog units was due primarily to a increase in the number of new orders for the six month period ended december  as compared to the same period ended december  the increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the increase in backlog units and a increase in the average price of new orders for the six month period ended december  as compared to the same period in mortgage banking segment nvr conducts its mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance  inc nvrm  a wholly owned subsidiary 
nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment s customer base 
following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended december   and loan closing volume total principal segment income capture rate mortgage banking fees net gain on sale of loans title services servicing fees gain on sale of servicing loan closing volume for the year ended december  increased from the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the average loan amount  and a year over year increase in the number of units closed 
the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment s average selling prices 
the unit increase for the year ended december  reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and an increase in the percentage of the number of loans closed for nvr s homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home capture rate 
segment income for the year ended december  increased approximately  from the increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned increase in closed loan volume 
this was net of an approximate  increase in general and administrative expenses during the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel costs due to a increase in the total number of nvrm employees in versus the additional staffing is to position nvrm for future growth and to increase the capture rate 
traditionally  adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages have been generally less profitable products than fixed rate mortgages 
during and early  we saw a shift to these less profitable products 
however  in the second half of  with the change in interest rates  the differential between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages narrowed  and we are now experiencing a favorable product mix shift back to fixed rate mortgages 
we expect this product mix shift to continue into mortgage loans held for sale increased approximately  at december  compared to december  this was primarily due to a increase in the december loan closing volume compared to december mortgage loans held for sale are typically sold to third party investors within days from date of closing 
loan closing volume for the year ended december  increased from the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in the average loan amount  and a year over year increase in the number of units closed 
the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment s average selling prices 
the unit increase for the year ended december  reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and a slight increase in the capture rate 
segment income for the year ended december  decreased approximately  from the decrease was primarily due to a product mix shift during from fixed rate mortgages to adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages 
the decrease was also due to higher costs incurred of approximately  related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan 
the decreases due to the product mix shift and contractual repayments was partially offset by the higher loan volume 
general and administrative expenses also increased by approximately  from to  largely due to an increase in the total number of nvrm employees in versus seasonality overall  we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales  settlements or loan closings 
effective tax rate our consolidated effective tax rates were   and in  and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to the favorable tax impact of the new internal revenue code section domestic manufacturing deduction established by the american jobs creation act of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb no 
sfas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements 
in april  the securities and exchange commission amended the effective date for sfas r 
sfas r is now effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of a registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  sfas r applies to all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date  and all outstanding portions of awards granted prior to the effective date which are unvested as of the effective date of the pronouncement 
entities may adopt the provisions of sfas r using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective methods 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for either recognition or pro forma disclosure 
for periods before the required effective date  the modified retrospective application may be applied to either a all prior years for which sfas was effective or b only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption  on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas sfas r becomes effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we plan to adopt the sfas r using the modified prospective method 
we expect our full year after tax expense to be approximately  in related to the implementation of sfas r  based on unvested stock options outstanding at december  liquidity and capital resources lines of credit and notes payable our homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a short term unsecured working capital revolving credit facility the facility 
during  we increased the available borrowings under the facility to  from  by refinancing our previous working capital agreement 
the current facility now provides for borrowings of up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the facility expires in december and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate plus an applicable margin as defined within the facility based on nvr s credit rating and or debt to capital ratio or ii london interbank offering rate libor plus applicable margin as defined above 
the weighted average interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility were and for and  respectively 
up to  of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit  of which  was outstanding at december  the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants 
the negative covenants include among others  certain limitations on transactions involving the creation of guarantees  sale of assets  acquisitions  mergers  investments and land purchases 
additional covenants include i a minimum adjusted consolidated tangible net worth requirement ii a maximum leverage ratio requirement  and iii an interest coverage ratio requirement 
these covenants restrict the amount in which we would be able to pay in dividends each year 
we are also subject to borrowing base restrictions if our senior debt rating falls below investment grade 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants under the facility and there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings 
at december   we had direct borrowings outstanding under the facility of  nvr s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various short term credit facilities 
nvrm has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility the revolving credit agreement with an aggregate borrowing limit of  this limit was temporarily increased to  on december  to accommodate heavy year end closing volume 
the borrowing limit reverted back to  on january  the revolving credit agreement is used to fund nvrm s mortgage origination activities  under which  was outstanding at december  as of december   borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately  the revolving credit agreement expires in august the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is either i libor plus  or ii to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement was during nvrm s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvrm to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
in addition  nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of  nvrm also currently has available an aggregate of  of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement 
amounts outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgage backed securities and whole loans 
there were no borrowings under this uncommitted facility during on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance of up to  of debt securities the shelf registration 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on february  and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series  and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 
on june   we completed an offering  at par  for  of senior notes due the notes under the shelf registration 
the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately  after deducting offering expenses 
the notes mature on june  and bear interest at  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our working capital credit facility 
the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time upon not less than nor more than days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed  plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest 
on july   we used approximately  of the proceeds received from the sale of the notes to redeem all of the  outstanding senior notes due at a price of of the principal amount outstanding  including the payment of accrued interest 
the redemption resulted in a charge to pre tax homebuilding income of  on may   we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf registration with the sec to register up to  for future offer and sale of debt securities  common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants 
the sec declared the shelf registration effective on june  nvr expects to use the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the shelf registration for general corporate purposes 
in addition  we have  remaining available for issuance under the shelf registration 
this discussion of our shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 
equity repurchases in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations  we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions 
this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations  and is typically executed in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b of the securities and exchange act of the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective  creating increases in shareholder value 
see part ii  item of the form k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of  during january  which fully utilized all available share repurchase authorizations 
cash flows as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   our operating activities provided cash of  cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the realization of a tax benefit of approximately  from employee stock based compensation activities 
these tax benefits were recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year 
cash was also provided by a  increase in customer deposits resulting primarily from the increase in backlog units in as compared to cash was used primarily to fund increases in homebuilding and mortgage loan inventory of approximately  and  respectively  and to make deposits on fixed price purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots 
the increase in contract land deposits of approximately  related to both payments for new  fixed price purchase agreements and to scheduled payments under existing contracts upon achievement of development milestones 
we control approximately  lots at december   as compared to approximately  lots at december  net cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of approximately  in property and equipment purchases throughout the period 
in addition  on january  we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of marc homebuilders  inc  a homebuilder in columbia  south carolina for  in cash see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquired business operates under the rymarc trade name 
net cash used for financing activities was  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our ongoing common stock repurchase program  offset by a net increase of approximately  under our credit lines 
we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock in for an aggregate purchase price of  at december   the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of  and  respectively  which includes certain customer deposits  mortgagor tax escrows  insurance escrows  completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities and the public debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 
off balance sheet arrangements lot acquisition strategy we do not engage in the land development business 
instead  we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement 
the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage  typically ranging up to  of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 
our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development 
we may  at our option  choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract 
our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements 
we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and  with the exception of three specific performance contracts for lots at an aggregate purchase price of approximately  existing at december   we do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements 
at december   we controlled approximately  lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  by making or committing to make deposits of approximately  in the form of cash and letters of credit 
our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate  contractual commitment resulting from our non performance under the contracts is limited to the  deposit amount 
of the  deposit total  approximately  in cash and approximately  in letters of credit have been issued as of december   and  will be paid subsequent to december   assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting under fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
bonds and letters of credit we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities  government agencies  or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts 
we had  of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december  inclusive of the  of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above 
we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit 
mortgage commitments and forward sales in the normal course of business  our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single family homes with fixed expiration dates 
the commitments become effective when the borrowers lock in a specified interest rate within time frames established by us 
all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment 
to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers  we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage backed securities to broker dealers 
the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives 
both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to broker dealers are undesignated derivatives  and  accordingly  are marked to market through earnings 
at december   there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately  and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately  contractual obligations our fixed  non cancelable obligations as of december   were as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years debt a capital leases b operating leases c purchase obligations d executive officer employment contracts e other long term liabilities f total a payments include interest payments due on the senior notes due see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters 
b the present value of these obligations is included on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding capital lease obligations 
c see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding operating leases 
d amounts represent required payments of forfeitable deposits with land developers under existing  fixed price purchase agreements  assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers 
we expect to make all payments of these deposits within the next three years but due to the nature of the contractual development milestones that must be met  we are unable to accurately estimate the portion of the deposit obligation that will be made within one year and that portion that will be made within one to three years 
in addition to the  to be paid pursuant to the prior discussion  as of december   we had capitalized forfeitable deposits for fixed price purchase agreements with developers totaling  and outstanding letters of credit of approximately  e we have entered into employment agreements with four of our executive officers 
each of the agreements expires on january  and provides for payment of a minimum base salary  which may be increased at the discretion of the compensation committee of nvr s board of directors the compensation committee  and annual incentive compensation of up to of base salary upon achievement of annual performance objectives established by the compensation committee 
the agreements also provide for payment of severance benefits upon termination of employment  in amounts ranging from to two times the executive officer s then annual base salary  depending on the reason for termination  plus up to in outplacement assistance 
accordingly  total payments under these agreements will vary based on length of service  any future increases to base salaries  annual incentive payments earned  and the reason for termination 
the agreements have been reflected in the above table assuming the continued employment of the executive officers for the full term of the respective agreements  and at the executive officers current base salaries 
the above balances do not include any potential annual incentive compensation 
the actual amounts paid could differ from that presented 
f amounts represent payments due under incentive compensation plans and are included on the consolidated balance sheets   of which is recorded in the mortgage banking accounts payable and other liabilities line item 
critical accounting policies general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements  and update those estimates as necessary 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 
variable interest entities revised financial interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was effective for us as of march   requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity on its financial statements 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual  or other financial interests in the entity 
expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity s net assets exclusive of its variable interests  and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity s net assets  exclusive of its variable interests 
forward contracts  such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory  are deemed to be variable interests under fin r 
therefore  the development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined under fin r for possible consolidation by us  including certain joint venture limited liability corporations llc s utilized by us to acquire finished lots on a limited basis 
we have developed a methodology to determine whether we  or  conversely  the owner s of the applicable development entity  are the primary beneficiary of a development entity 
the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimates 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract 
although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots  changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding whether we are or are not a development entity s primary beneficiary  possibly resulting in additional  or fewer  development entities being consolidated on our financial statements 
homebuilding inventory the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units 
field construction supervisors salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs 
interest costs are not capitalized into inventory 
upon settlement  the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis 
cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a first in  first out basis 
recoverability and impairment  if any  is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets 
we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 
contract land deposits we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract 
the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 
we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio 
the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period  considering market and economic conditions  sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts 
although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december  balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 
intangible assets reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets excess reorganization value  goodwill  and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
rather  excess reorganization value  goodwill  and other intangible assets are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorganization value  goodwill  and other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we completed the annual assessment of impairment during the first quarter of  and as of december   we believe that excess reorganization value  goodwill  and other intangible assets were not impaired 
this conclusion is based on management s judgment  considering such factors as our history of operating success  our well recognized brand names  and the significant positions held in the markets in which we operate 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value  goodwill  and or other intangible assets exceeds their fair value 
warranty product liability accruals warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects  product recalls and litigation incidental to our business 
liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience  the likely current cost of corrective action  manufacturers and subcontractors participation in sharing the cost of corrective action  consultations with third party experts such as engineers  and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases 
although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december  balance sheet see note to the consolidated financial statements to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor  the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action  unanticipated adverse legal settlements  or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 
impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions see risk factors included in item a herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments 
interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers  while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans 
we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 
our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities 
the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans  which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets 
all of the mortgage banking segment s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments 
nvrm also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 
our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the homebuilding segment s primary debt is a variable rate working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the facility expires in december and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate plus an applicable margin as defined within the facility based on nvr s credit rating and or debt to capital ratio or ii libor plus applicable margin as defined above 
the weighted average interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility were and for and  respectively 
nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility  which had a borrowing limit of  at december  the available borrowing limit was reduced to  on january  the mortgage warehouse facility is used to fund its mortgage origination activities 
the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i libor plus  or ii to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was during the following table represents the contractual balances of our on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments  at december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets  we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year
