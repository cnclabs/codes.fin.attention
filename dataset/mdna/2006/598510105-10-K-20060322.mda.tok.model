the company s tier leverage ratio  which measures tier capital in relation to total assets  was percent as of december  and percent at december   exceeding the regulatory minimum requirement range of percent to percent 

table of contents the company s common stock closed the year at per share  representing times the december  book value per share of 
the book value per share was on december  tangible book value per share was on december  compared with on december  liquidity liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers 
liquidity management is conducted by the company on both a daily and long term basis 
the company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of expected loan demand  projected loan sales  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest bearing deposits  and the objectives of its asset liability management program 
excess liquidity is invested generally in short term us government and agency securities  short term state and political subdivision securities  and other investment securities 
liquid assets of cash on hand  balances due from other banks  and federal funds sold are maintained to meet customer needs 
the company had liquid assets of  as of december   compared with  as of december  investment securities classified as available for sale and securities and loans maturing within one year totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
assets maturing within one year  combined with liquid assets  were percent at december  and percent at december  of total deposits as of the same dates 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  advances from the federal home loan bank  principal repayments on loans  proceeds from the sale of loans  principal recoveries on loan pool participations  proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities  its commercial bank line of credit  and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan amortization and maturing interest bearing deposits are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions  the general level of interest rates  and competition 
principal recoveries on loan pool participations are also influenced by economic conditions and to a lesser extent  the interest rate environment 
the company utilizes particular sources of funds based on comparative costs and availability 
this includes fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank that were obtained at a more favorable cost than deposits 
the company generally manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a steady deposit base but has from time to time decided not to pay rates on deposits as high as its competition 
net cash provided by operations is another major source of liquidity 
the net cash provided by operating activities was  in this trend of strong cash from operations is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to fund its loan commitments 
as of december   the company had outstanding commitments to extend credit of  and had commitments to sell loans of  certificates of deposit maturing in one year or less totaled  as of december  management believes that a significant portion of these deposits will remain with the company 
the declaration of dividends are subject to  among other things  the company s financial condition and results of operations  the bank s compliance with regulatory capital requirements  tax considerations  industry standards  economic conditions  regulatory restrictions  general business practices and other factors 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on regulatory limitations on dividends from the bank to the company and additional information on dividends 
the payment of dividends is dependent upon the company having adequate cash or other assets that can be converted into cash to pay dividends to its stockholders 
the company does not anticipate a liquidity problem in relating to the payment of dividends 
the company was not in compliance with two covenants of its loan agreement with harris  n 
a 
as of september  this was due to the level of nonperforming assets exceeding percent of capital as of that date at three of the subsidiary banks and due to the company not obtaining a required consolidated return on 
table of contents assets of 
percent for the preceding twelve months 
a waiver for the noncompliance with the two covenants of the loan agreement was obtained from harris  n 
a 
for september  the waiver also allowed nonperforming assets as of december  to increase to percent of capital for the individual subsidiary banks 
the company was in compliance with the nonperforming assets level as modified by the waiver and with all other original covenants of the loan agreement including return on assets as of december  the waiver provides that the original loan agreement covenants will apply to the quarter ending march  given the resolution of a large nonperforming asset in the first quarter of  management anticipates that the company will be in compliance with all loan agreement covenants in the company continues to seek acquisition opportunities that would strengthen its presence in current and new market areas 
there are currently no pending acquisitions that would require the company to secure capital from public or private markets 
asset liability management the company s strategy with respect to asset liability management is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated with volatile interest rates 
this strategy is implemented by the bank s asset liability committee that takes action based upon its analysis of expected changes in the composition and volumes of the balance sheet and the fluctuations in market interest rates 
one of the measures of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio 
this ratio indicates the amount of interest earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time 
a gap ratio of indicates a matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal 
a gap ratio of less than indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period and a ratio greater than indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities 
as of december   the company s cumulative gap ratios for assets and liabilities repricing within three months and within one year were 
and  respectively  meaning more liabilities than assets are repriceable within these periods 
the gap position is largely the result of classifying interest bearing demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts as immediately repriceable 
historically  the company has not repriced these accounts as frequently or as quickly as it adjusts the rates on new and renewing certificates of deposit 
loan pool participations are repriced over a three year period based on the historical average for return of pool investment 

table of contents the following table sets forth the scheduled repricing or maturity of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities as of december   based on the assumptions described below 
the effect of these assumptions is to quantify the dollar amount of items that are interest rate sensitive and can be repriced within each of the periods specified 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s interest margin because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes 
three months or less over three months to one year one to three years three years or more total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans loan pool participations interest bearing deposits in banks investment securities available for sale held to maturity total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now accounts savings deposits certificates of deposit federal funds purchased federal home loan bank advances notes payable long term debt total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap per period cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio in the table above  now accounts and savings deposits are included as interest bearing liabilities in the three months or less category 
loan pool participations are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis using an estimated three year average life 
the historical average for the return of original investment on the pools is approximately months 
given the non performing aspect of the loan pool portfolio  management feels that the use of contractual weighted average maturity data is inappropriate 
future prospects inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
management believes that inflation does not affect the banking industry as much as it does other industries with a high proportion of fixed assets and inventory 
inflation does  however  have an impact on the growth of total assets and the need to maintain a proper level of shareholders capital 
interest rates are significantly affected by inflation 
it is difficult to assess the impact rate changes have since neither the timing nor the magnitude of changes in the various inflation indices coincides with changes in interest rates 
there is  of course  an impact on longer term earning assets  however  this effect continues to 
table of contents diminish as investment maturities are shortened and interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities shift from fixed rate long term to rate sensitive short term 
during the national inflation rate increased as the economy continued to grow 
the federal reserve continued to move interest rates upward with increases in the fed funds rate that served to increase the prime rate to percent as of december   compared to percent as of december  management of the company believes that the rate of inflation will increase somewhat and that interest rates will continue to increase in the first half of the year 
the federal reserve s target rate for fed funds is forecast to move upward 
to 
percent by mid the company is in a negative gap position with a greater amount of interest bearing liabilities repriceable compared to repriceable interest earning assets 
if interest rates do increase  the company s net interest margin may contract as interest expense may increase faster than interest income 
management continues to focus on managing the net interest margin in management anticipates that in they will continue to focus on growing the company through increased deposits 
growth in the loan portfolio will remain a priority 
on january   the bank opened a new branch facility in davenport  iowa 
the new branch is located in the downtown business district of the community and is viewed as a temporary location until a more suitable permanent facility can be constructed 
the quad cities area was selected for the branch expansion as it is a growing market in proximity to the company s existing locations 
opportunities to acquire additional loan pool participation investments will continue 
bids on pool participations during the year will take into account the availability of funds to invest  the market for such pools in terms of price and availability  and the potential return on the pools relative to risk 
critical accounting policies the company has identified two critical accounting policies and practices relative to the financial condition and results of operation 
these two accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses and to loan pool accounting 
critical accounting policies the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these potential losses could be either identified or unidentified 
the accuracy of this estimate could have a material impact on the company s earnings 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the loan portfolio represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charges off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of various factors 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of potential losses 
in evaluating the portfolio  management takes into consideration numerous factors  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
these factors include current economic conditions and tends  historical loan loss experience  the composition of the loan portfolio including mix and loan type  loan collateral values  loan classification  loan delinquencies  specific impaired loans and estimated probable credit losses 
nonperforming  classified and large loans are specifically reviewed for impairment and the allowance is allocated on a loan by loan basis as deemed necessary 
loans not specifically allocated and homogenous loans are grouped into categories to which a loss percentage  based on historical experience  is allocated 

table of contents the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is monitored on an on going basis by the loan review officer  senior management and the bank s board of directors 
in addition  the various regulatory agencies that examine the bank periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require the company to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there can be no assurances that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all loan losses  but management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate as of december  the loan pool accounting practice is also considered a critical accounting policy by the company 
the loan pool accounting practice relates to management s opinion that the investment amount reflected on the company s financial statements does not exceed the estimated net realizable value of the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the purchased loans 
in evaluating the purchased loan portfolio  management takes into account many of the same factors that are considered relative to the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the aforementioned factors  consideration is also given to the borrower s current financial situation  underlying collateral values  historical collection experience and the borrower s repayment history 
the procedures employed to evaluate the fair value of the loan pool assets are essentially similar to those employed in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses with an estimate of potential loss based on impairment by homogeneous and non homogeneous loans 
the evaluation of the net realizable value of the purchased loans is performed by the company s loan review officer and monitored by the senior management and the bank s board of directors 
impairment of the net realizable value is recognized as a write down in the basis of the asset and reflected as a reduction in the interest and discount income 
to the extent that the net realizable value of the loan pools is impaired  the company s yield on the loan pools would be reduced 
management believes that as of december   the net realizable value of the loan pool investment exceeds the carrying amount reflected on the company s books 
impact of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act was signed into law on july  the act aimed to correct what were perceived as structural weaknesses affecting the capital markets  which may have contributed to massive losses such as those experienced by the stockholders of enron and worldcom 
these structural weaknesses were revealed by substantial misstatements in the financial statements of these companies  the apparent failure of boards of directors and public accountants to detect and correct these errors on a timely basis  and the apparent failures of stock analysts to detect weaknesses in financial information 
the act aimed to increase the reliability of financial information by placing corporate executives under considerable pressure to make sure financial information is correct 
this included a requirement for the ceo and cfo to certify reports submitted to the sec and to report on the effectiveness of internal control 
the act strengthened the power and independence of corporate audit committees by requiring the committee to take charge of hiring  overseeing  and compensating the company s auditor and requiring that the audit committee members be independent of the company 
auditors now report directly to the audit committee 
the act also limited the non audit services that the company s audit firm may provide and required that any allowable non audit services must be pre approved by the audit committee 
the act added more disclosure to be included in financial reports filed with the sec 
it added new sanctions and increases the severity of a number of civil and criminal penalties related to securities law violations  in addition to severe penalties for certification of faulty financial statements 
additionally  the act placed a number of restrictions on the activities of securities firms and their employees that are supposed to isolate security analysts from pressures that may compromise the objectivity of their reports 
the implementation deadlines for section of the sarbanes oxley act of continue to evolve 
section requires that management of the company assess the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year  and to include in the company s annual report to shareholders management s conclusion  as a result of that assessment  about whether the company s internal 
table of contents controls are effective 
additionally  the company s external auditors are required under section to evaluate and attest to management s assessment 
under the definitions of sarbanes oxley  the company is a non accelerated filer since it has public float of less than  public float for this purpose is the market value of the company s outstanding common equity held by non affiliates as of the end of its second fiscal quarter 
for the company  this is the quarter ended june th 
in september  the sec revised the compliance deadline for non accelerated filers to the first fiscal year ending on or after july  the sec continues to evaluate the compliance and reporting guidelines for non accelerated filers 
management of the company and the company s audit committee are working together to insure that the financial information reported by the company is correct and reliable  that the required evaluation of internal controls takes place  and that certification by management is performed 
during the year  the company began utilizing the services of an outside consultant to assist management in the evaluation of the adequacy of its internal control structures and procedures for financial reporting 
on february   the sec advisory committee on smaller public companies issued a request for comment on an exposure draft that recommends changes to the requirements of sarbanes oxley as it relates to the small companies 
if the recommended changes were adopted by the sec  small publicly held companies with market capital of less than million and revenues no greater than million would be exempted from the management assessment of internal controls requirement under section of sarbanes oxley 
given the company s market capital level and revenue  it would thus be potentially exempt from the requirements of section comments on the exposure draft are due by april   with final submission of the report to the sec anticipated later in the month of april item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of earnings volatility that results from adverse changes in interest rates and market prices 
the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the company s net interest income 
management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk 
management does not believe that the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures were managed in changed when compared to the company uses a third party computer software simulation modeling program to measure its exposure to potential interest rate changes 
for various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates  numerous other assumptions are made such as prepayment speeds on loans and securities backed by mortgages  the slope of the treasury yield curve  the rates and volumes of the company s deposits  and the rates and volumes of the company s loans 
this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  change change bp bp base bp bp as shown above  at december   the effect of a ramped basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by approximately  the effect of a ramped basis point decrease in rates would decrease the company s net interest income by approximately  an increase in interest rates would cause more of the company s interest bearing liabilities to reprice than interest earning assets  thus reducing net interest income 
as the rate on many of the interest bearing liabilities could not 
table of contents be decreased by another basis points  any additional reductions in market interest rates could reduce the company s net interest income as rates on repriceable assets are reduced while rates on liabilities cannot be lowered proportionally 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
