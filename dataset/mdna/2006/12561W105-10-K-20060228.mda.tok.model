power generation cleco power operates and either owns or has an ownership interest in three steam electric generating stations and one gas turbine 
as of december   cleco power s aggregate net electric generating capacity was  mw

construction is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of pending receipt of governmental approvals 
the plant is expected to be on line in the fourth quarter of for additional information on cleco power s proposed solid fuel unit  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cleco power 
fuel and purchased power changes in fuel and purchased power expenses reflect fluctuations in types and pricing of fuel used for electric generation  fuel handling costs  availability of economical power for purchase  and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers through the fuel adjustment clause in subsequent months 
for a discussion on the changes in fuel costs and its impact on utility customers  see item a  risk factors fuel costs and purchased power 
the following table sets forth the percentages of power generated from various fuels at cleco power s electric generating plants  the cost of fuel used per mwh attributable to each such fuel  and the weighted average fuel cost per mwh 
lignite coal gas fuel oil weighted year cost per mwh percent of generation cost per mwh percent of generation cost per mwh percent of generation cost per mwh percent of generation average cost per mwh less than of one percent power purchases when the market price of power is more economical than self generation of power or when cleco power needs power to supplement its own electric generation  and when transmission capacity is available  cleco power purchases power from energy marketing companies or neighboring utilities 
these purchases are made from the wholesale power market in the form of generation capacity and or energy 
portions of cleco power s capacity and power purchases were made at fixed prices  and the remainder were made approximately at prevailing market prices 
the following table sets forth the average cost and amounts of power purchased by cleco power on the wholesale market 
period cost per mwh thousand mwh percent of total energy requirements during  of cleco power s energy requirements were met with purchased power  down from in the primary factor causing the decrease was the increased generation of power from cleco power s own facilities due to higher priced purchase power compared to cleco power s incremental generation cost 
for information on cleco power s ability to pass on to its customers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power expenses  see regulatory matters  industry developments  and franchises rates 
during  cleco power obtained approximately of its annual capacity from a five year  mw power contract with williams and a one year  mw power contract with ces  both of which expired on december  cleco power has a long term contract allowing for the purchase of mw of power from the sabine river authority  which operates a hydroelectric generating plant 
in addition  cleco power has a wholesale power contract with the city of natchitoches for mw of capacity that expires in december as a result of its multiple rfps  cleco power signed two power purchase contracts on august  the first was a four year contract for mw from williams beginning in january the other was a one year contract for mw of capacity from ces also beginning in january both power purchase contracts were certified by the lpsc in november as a result of the calpine debtors declaring bankruptcy in late december  cleco power continues to explore alternatives to ensure it has access to sufficient supplies of energy should the ces contract need to be replaced 
as of the date of this form k  ces has performed its obligations under this one year contract 
management expects to meet its native load demand in with cleco power s own generation capacity and power contracts with williams and ces or if terminated  replacements to the ces contract 
cleco power has issued an rfp for up to mw to meet its capacity and energy requirements 
the options selected in this rfp will begin january  for additional information on cleco power s risks associated with purchased power contracts  see item a  risk factors purchased power 
in  cleco power formed an irp team to evaluate its long term capacity requirements 
irp is a process to evaluate resources in order to provide reliable and flexible power supplies to electric customers at the lowest reasonable cost 
a full range of options were analyzed including new generation asset construction  power purchases  fuel conversion  repowering projects  asset acquisitions  additional transmission infrastructure  cogeneration  plant retirements  and mothballing of existing assets 
the process considers operational and economical features  such as construction  operating and fuel costs  fuel diversity  reliability  ease of dispatch  environmental impact  and other factors of risk 
the irp team has developed a framework for evaluating proposed options to optimize service for cleco power s customers needs and to reduce and stabilize their fuel cost without sacrificing reliability 
any viable generation alternative must then be validated through an lpsc sanctioned rfp process 
for additional information on cleco power s power supply  see item a  risk factors rodemacher unit ccn  rodemacher unit construction  and purchased power 
because of its location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
at times  constraints limit the amount of purchased power these transmission providers can deliver into cleco power s service territory 
the power contracts with williams and ces that began on january   as well as spot market power purchases  may be affected by these transmission constraints 
coal and lignite supply cleco power uses coal for generation at rodemacher unit the majority of this coal is purchased from mines in wyoming s powder river basin from kennecott energy company kennecott 
in july  cleco power entered into a new two year agreement with kennecott that established fixed pricing through december   for the majority of cleco power s coal needs 
due to force majeure events in relating to rail transportation from the powder river basin  cleco power purchased coal from sources outside the powder river basin at prices higher than those provided for in the kennecott contract for part of for a discussion on the changes in fuel costs and its impact on utility customers  see item a  risk factors fuel costs 
for  cleco power has contracted for additional coal from the spot market 
during  cleco power signed a three year agreement with union pacific for transportation of coal from the powder river basin to rodemacher unit through cleco power leases railcars to transport its coal under two long term leases 
one of the railcar leases expires in march  and the other expires in march cleco power uses lignite for generation at the dolet hills power station 
substantially all of the lignite used to fuel dolet hills is obtained under two long term agreements 
cleco power and swepco  each a owner of dolet hills  have acquired an undivided interest in the other s leased and owned lignite reserves in northwestern louisiana 
in may  cleco power and swepco entered into a long term agreement with annual renewals through with dhlc for the mining and delivery of such lignite reserves 
these reserves are expected to provide a substantial portion of the dolet hills unit s fuel requirements throughout the life of the contract with dhlc 
additionally  cleco power and swepco have entered into an agreement which expires in with red river mining company to purchase lignite 
cleco power s minimum annual purchase requirement of lignite under this agreement is  tons 
the lignite price under the contract is a base price per mmbtu  subject to escalation  plus certain pass through costs 
dhlc provides all of the lignite in excess of the  tons base commitment 
for information regarding deferred mining costs and obligations associated with the dhlc mining agreement see  part ii
