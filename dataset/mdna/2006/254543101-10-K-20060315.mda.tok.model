item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a global supplier of discrete and analog ic semiconductor products 
we design  manufacture and market discrete semiconductors focused on diverse end use applications in the consumer electronics  computing  industrial  communications and automotive sectors 
discrete semiconductors  which provide electronic signal amplification and switching functions  are basic building block electronic components that are incorporated into almost every electronic device 
we believe that our product focus provides us with a meaningful competitive advantage relative to broadline semiconductor companies that provide a wider range of semiconductor products 
we are headquartered in westlake village  california  near los angeles 
we have two manufacturing facilities located in shanghai  china  and a wafer fabrication facility in kansas city  missouri  and our sales and marketing and logistical centers are located in taipei  taiwan  shanghai and shenzhen  china  and hong kong 
we also have regional sales offices or representatives in derbyshire  england  toulouse  france  frankfurt  germany  and various cities in the united states 
in  we began to transform our business from the distribution of discrete semiconductors manufactured by others to the design  manufacture and marketing of discrete semiconductor products using our internal manufacturing capabilities 
the key elements of our strategy of transforming our business from a distribution based model to one primarily based on the design and manufacture of proprietary products are expanding our manufacturing capacity  including establishing integrated state of the art packaging and testing facilities in asia  in and  and acquiring a wafer foundry in the united states in expanding our sales and marketing organization in asia in order to address the shift of manufacturing of electronics products from the united states to asia 
establishing our sales and marketing organization in europe commencing in expanding the number of our field application engineers to design our products into specific end user applications 
in implementing this strategy  the following factors have affected  and  we believe  will continue to affect  our results of operations since  we have experienced increases in the demand for our products  and substantial pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the selling price of our products 
we expect future increases in net income to result primarily from increases in sales volume and improvements in product mix in order to offset reduced average selling prices of our products 
in and  and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from products introduced within the last three years  which we term new products  compared to in new products generally have gross profit margins that are significantly higher than the margins of our standard products 
we expect net sales derived from new products to increase in absolute terms  although our net sales of new products as a percentage of our net sales will depend on the demand for our standard products  as well as our product mix 
our gross profit margin was in  compared to in and in this improvement in our gross margin was due to improvements in product mix  as well as increases in wafer and packaging yields  reductions in manufacturing costs and increases in capacity utilization 
we expect only modest improvements in yields and capacity utilization in the future and  as a result  future gross profit margins will depend primarily on our product mix  as well as on the demand for our product 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in our asian manufacturing facilities 
during   we invested approximately million in our asian manufacturing facilities and we expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing facilities  although the amount to be invested will depend on product demand and new product developments 
during  the percentage of our net sales derived from our asian subsidiaries was  compared to in and in we expect our net sales to the asian market to continue to increase as a percentage of our total net sales for and beyond as a result of the continuing shift of the manufacture of electronic products from the united states to asia 
we have increased our investment in research and development from million in to million in we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on proprietary discrete processes and packaging technologies 
our goal is to expand research and development expenses to approximately of net sales as we bring additional proprietary devices to the market 
during  we sold  shares of our common stock in a follow on public offering  raising approximately million net of commissions and expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds in connection with the anachip acquisition and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  in december  we announced the acquisition of anachip  a fabless taiwanese semiconductor company focused on analog ics designed for specific applications 
the acquisition  which closed on january   fits in the center of our long term strategy 
anachip s main product focus is power management ics 
the analog devices they produce are used in lcd monitor tv s  wireless lan access points  brushless dc motor fans  portable dvd players  datacom devices  adsl modems  tv satellite set top boxes  and power supplies 
anachip brings a design team with strong capabilities in a range of targeted analog and power management technologies 
this acquisition also shows our disciplined approach to making acquisitions 
we paid approximately million to acquire anachip  which had power management ic revenues of approximately million 
the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings 
net sales we generate a substantial portion of our net sales through the sale of discrete semiconductor products  designed and manufactured by us or third parties 
we also generate a portion of our net sales from outsourcing manufacturing capacity to third parties and from the sale of silicon wafers to manufacturers of discrete semiconductor components 
we serve customers across diversified industry segments  including the consumer electronics  computing  industrial  communications and automotive markets 
we recognize revenue from product sales when title to and risk of loss of the product have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met upon shipment to our customers 
net sales are stated net of reserves for pricing adjustments  discounts  rebates and returns 
the principal factors that have affected or could affect our net sales from period to period are the condition of the economy in general and of the semiconductor industry in particular  our customers adjustments in their order levels  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  the termination of key supplier relationships  the rate of introduction to  and acceptance of new products by  our customers  our ability to compete effectively with our current and future competitors  our ability to enter into and renew key corporate and strategic relationships with our customers  vendors and strategic alliances  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  a major disruption of our information technology infrastructure  and unforeseen catastrophic events  such as armed conflict  terrorism  fires  typhoons and earthquakes 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs for our discrete semiconductors and our wafers 
these costs include raw materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the labor costs and overhead expenses 
cost of goods sold is also impacted by yield improvements  capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  cost of goods sold includes the cost of products that we purchase from other manufacturers and sell to our customers 
cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not efficient 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and associated expenses for personnel in general management  sales and marketing  information technology  engineering  human resources  procurement  planning and finance  and sales commissions  as well as outside legal  accounting and consulting expenses  and other operating expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales  marketing and engineering efforts and information technology infrastructure 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development projects  as well as materials and equipment used for these projects 
research and development expenses are primarily associated with our wafer facility in kansas city  missouri and our manufacturing facilities in china  as well as our engineers at our us headquarters 
all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred  and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in new technologies and product lines 
interest income expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investment balances 
interest expense consists of interest payable on our outstanding credit facilities 
income tax provision our global presence requires us to pay income taxes in a number of jurisdictions 
in general  earnings in the united states and taiwan are currently subject to tax rates of and  respectively 
earnings of diodes hong kong are currently subject to a tax for local sales and or local source sales  with all other sales foreign income tax free 
earnings at diodes taiwan and diodes hong kong are also subject to us taxes with respect to those earnings that are derived from product manufactured by our china subsidiaries and sold to customers outside of taiwan and hong kong  respectively 
the us tax rate on these earnings is computed as the difference between the foreign effective tax rates and the us tax rate 
in accordance with us tax law  we receive credit against our us federal tax liability for income taxes paid by our foreign subsidiaries 
as an incentive for establishing our first shanghai based manufacturing subsidiary  diodes china  in  and in accordance with the taxation policies of china  diodes china  received preferential tax treatment for the years ended december  through diodes china is located in the songjiang district  where the standard central government tax rate is 
however  as an incentive for establishing diodes china  the earnings of diodes china were subject to a tax rate by the central government from through  and to a tax rate from through for and future years  diodes china s earnings will continue to be subject to a tax rate provided it exports at least of its net sales 
in addition  due to an million permanent re investment of diodes china earnings in  diodes china has applied to the chinese government for additional preferential tax treatment on earnings that are generated by this million investment 
if approved  those earnings will be exempted from central government income tax for two years  and then subject to a tax rate for the following three years 
in addition  the earnings of diodes china would ordinarily be subject to a standard local government tax rate of 
however  as an incentive for establishing diodes china  the local government waived this tax from through management expects this tax to be waived for at least the first half of  however  the local government can re impose this tax at any time in its discretion 
in  we established our second shanghai based manufacturing facility  diodes shanghai  located in the songjiang export zone of shanghai  china 
in the songjiang export zone  the central government standard tax rate is 
there is no local government tax 
during  diodes shanghai earnings were subject to the standard central government tax rate 
as an incentive for establishing diodes shanghai  for and the earnings of diodes shanghai are exempted from central government income tax  and for the years through its earnings will be subject to a tax rate 
from onward  provided that diodes shanghai exports over of its net sales  its earnings will be subject to a tax rate 
earnings of diodes taiwan are currently subject to a tax rate of  which is comparable to the us federal tax rate for c corporations 
earnings of diodes hong kong are currently subject to a tax for local sales and or local source sales  all other sales are foreign income tax free 
in accordance with united states tax law  the company receives credit against its us federal tax liability for corporate taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions 
the repatriation of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the company may be subject to federal and state income taxes 
as of december   accumulated and undistributed earnings of diodes china and diodes shanghai are approximately million  including million of restricted earnings which are not available for dividends 
through march   the company had not recorded deferred us federal or state tax liabilities estimated to be million as of march  on these cumulative earnings since the company  at that time  considered this investment to be permanent  and had no plans or obligation to distribute all or part of that amount from china to the united states 
beginning in april  the company began to record deferred taxes on a portion of the china earnings in preparation of a dividend distribution 
in the year ended december   the company received a dividend of approximately million from its diodes china subsidiary  for which the tax effect is included in us federal and state taxable income 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act ajca into law 
originally intended to repeal the extraterritorial income eti exclusion  which had triggered tariffs by the european union  the ajca expanded to cover a wide range of business tax issues 
among other items  the ajca establishes a phased repeal of the eti  a new incentive tax deduction for us corporations to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate a deduction equal to of cash dividends received in the year elected that exceeds a base period amount and significantly revises the taxation of us companies doing business abroad 
at december   the company made a minimum estimate for repatriating cash from its subsidiaries in china and hong kong of million under the ajca  and recorded an income tax expense of approximately million 
under the guidelines of the ajca  the company developed a required domestic reinvestment plan  covering items such as us bank debt repayment  us capital expenditures and us research and development activities  among others  to cover the dividend repatriation 
during  the company completed a quantitative analysis of the benefits of the ajca  the foreign tax credit implications  and state and local tax consequences of the impact of the ajca on the company s plans for repatriation 
based on the analysis  the company repatriated million from its foreign subsidiaries in the company is evaluating the need to provide additional deferred taxes for the future earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings may be appropriated for distribution to the company s corporate office in north america  and as further investment strategies with respect to foreign earnings are determined 
should the company s north american cash requirements exceed the cash that is provided through the domestic credit facilities  cash can be obtained from the company s foreign subsidiaries 
however  the distribution of any unappropriated funds to the us will require the recording of income tax provisions on the us entity  thus reducing net income 
as of december   the company has recorded approximately million in deferred taxes for earnings of its foreign subsidiaries  primarily diodes hong kong 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when our product is shipped 
we reduce revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances  the majority of which are related to our north american operations 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to revenues 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory  both finished goods and raw material  for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
based upon this analysis  as well as an inventory aging analysis  we accrue a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if management ever determined that our deferred tax asset was not likely to be realized  a write down of the asset would be required and would be reflected as an expense in the accompanying period 
allowance for doubtful accounts management evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   goodwill was million million related to the fabtech acquisition  and  related to diodes china 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  for which goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
we performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and have determined that the goodwill is fully recoverable 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  on an on going basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our impairment review process is based upon i an income approach from a discounted cash flow analysis  which uses our estimates of revenues  costs and expenses  as well as market growth rates  and ii a market multiples approach which measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent sales or offerings or comparable public entities 
if ever the carrying value of the goodwill is determined to be less than the fair value of the underlying asset  a write down of the asset will be required  with the resulting expense charged in the period that the impairment was determined 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage that certain items in the statement of income bear to net sales and the percentage dollar increase decrease of such items from period to period

we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on next generation processes and packaging technologies 
our goal is to expand r d to of revenue as we bring proprietary technology and advanced devices to the market 
gain on sale of fixed assets gain on sale of fixed assets of  for was due primarily to a gain on the termination of two capital leases in china 
interest income expense net interest income for was  compared to net interest expense of  in  due primarily to interest income earned on proceeds from our public offering of equity securities in  as well as to a reduction in our total debt from million at december  to million at december  our interest income is generated for interest earned on our cash balances and short term investments 
our interest expense has been primarily the result of borrowings to finance the fabtech acquisition in  as well as our ongoing investment in  and expansion of  our diodes china and diodes shanghai manufacturing facilities 
other income other income for increased  from  due primarily to lower currency exchange losses in taiwan as well as the expiration of management incentive agreements associated with the fabtech acquisition 
income tax provision we recognized income tax expense of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of  as compared to million or for the same period in  due primarily to an increase in profits earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
minority interest in joint venture earnings minority interest in joint venture earnings represents the minority investor s share of the income of diodes china and diodes shanghai 
we established diodes shanghai in the increase in these subsidiaries income for the tweleve months ended december  is primarily the result of increased sales  and manufacturing efficiencies 
as of december   we had a controlling interest in each of these subsidiaries 
net income we generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the same period in this increase in net income is due primarily to the net sales increase at a gross profit margin of for  compared to a gross profit margin of in year compared to year net sales net sales for increased million to million  from million for the increase was due primarily to an approximately increase in units sold as a result of increased demand for our products  as well as an improved product mix  offset in part by a decrease in average selling prices for wafers

these cost decreases were due primarily to improved manufacturing efficiencies 
gross profit gross profit for increased to million from million for of the million increase  million was due to an increase in gross profit margin from in to in  while million was due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit increases in asia were the primary contributor to the overall gross profit increase in gross profit margin increased due to enhanced capacity utilization  continuing manufacturing efficiencies  relatively stable pricing  and a product mix that continued to shift toward higher value performance discrete semiconductor devices 
selling  general and administrative expenses for  sg a increased million to million from million for the increase in sg a was due primarily to higher sales commissions  incentives  marketing and royalty expenses associated with the increase in net sales for the year  and higher wage and benefits expenses 
also contributing to the increased selling  general and administrative expenses were higher corporate and administrative expenses  including legal and accounting fees  primarily associated with sarbanes oxley act compliance

interest expense  net net interest expense for decreased  to  from  in  due primarily to a decrease in the use of our credit facilities  as well as to lower interest rates 
in  we repaid million of debt outstanding under our credit facilities  reducing the balances outstanding from million at december  to million at december  other expense other expense for increased  compared to  primarily due to approximately  in currency exchange losses related to the weakened us dollar  primarily versus the taiwan dollar  recorded in the fourth quarter of income tax provision our effective tax rate in was  compared to for we recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of million for  compared to million for included in the tax provision for is million in deferred taxes recorded in the fourth quarter for an million planned dividend distribution from our asian subsidiaries in under the ajca  offset by a million foreign investment tax refund net of us taxes  and an approximately  research and development tax credit 
minority interest in joint venture earnings the minority interest in joint venture earnings represents the minority investor s share of income of diodes china and diodes shanghai 
diodes shanghai was established in the increase in these subsidiaries income for is primarily the result of increased sales of higher margin products 
as of december   we had a controlling interest in each of these subsidiaries 
net income we generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in  as compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for this increase in net income is due primarily to the net sales increase at a gross profit margin of in  compared to a gross profit margin of in financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash  funds from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our primary liquidity requirements have been to meet our inventory and capital expenditure needs 
for  and  our working capital was million  million  and million  respectively 
we anticipate our working capital position will be sufficient for at least the next months 
in  and  our capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures for these periods were primarily related to manufacturing expansion in our facilities in china and  to a lesser extent  our wafer fabrication facility in the united states 
the increased amount of capital expenditures from to million and million  respectively was primarily attributable to increasing capacity at our facilities to meet demand for our products  including the establishment of our diodes shanghai facility in in  our capital expenditures reduced to million as a result of increased equipment efficiencies and the slower market growth as compared to discussion of cash flows cash and short term investments have increased from million at december   to million at december   to million at december  the increase from to was primarily due to the proceeds from the follow on offering 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during was million  resulting primarily from million of net income in this period 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for and million for net cash provided by operations increased by million from to this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in our net income from million in to million in and decreases in inventories  resulting from faster inventory turns  and decreases in accounts receivable 
we continue to closely monitor our credit terms with our customers  while at times providing extended terms  primarily required by our customers in asia and europe 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities for was million resulting from capital expenditures of million net of million purchased on accounts payable  short term investments of municipal bonds and equity investments 
net cash used by investing activities was million for and million for net cash used for investing activities in those periods primarily related to manufacturing expansion in our facilities in china and  to a lesser extent  our wafer fabrication facility in the united states 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for was million  resulting primarily from million in net proceeds from the offering of equity securities  offset by million debt repayment 
in addition  the company received million from stock option exercises in net cash provided by financing activities was million for and million for net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily due to million received in connection with the exercise of stock options  partially offset by million repaid under our debt instruments 
net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily due to million received in connection with the exercise of stock options 
debt instruments on august   we amended our us credit arrangements with union bank of california  na union bank 
under the second amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement  we now have available a revolving credit commitment of up to million  including a million letter of credit sub facility 
in addition  and in connection with this amendment  one of our subsidiaries  fabtech  also amended and restated a term note and related agreement with respect to an existing term loan arrangement  which we refer to as the fabtech term loan 
after giving effect to this amendment  the principal amount under the fabtech term loan was increased to million 
the revolving credit commitment expires on august  the fabtech term loan  which amortizes monthly  matures on august  as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and there was million outstanding under the fabtech term loan 
loans to diodes incorporated under our credit facility are guaranteed by fabtech  and in turn  the fabtech term loan is guaranteed by diodes incorporated 
the purpose of the revolving credit facility is to provide cash for domestic working capital purposes  and to fund permitted acquisitions 
all loans under the credit facility and the fabtech term loan are collateralized by all of diodes incorporated s and fabtech s accounts  instruments  chattel paper  documents  general intangibles  inventory  equipment  furniture and fixtures  pursuant to security agreements entered into by diodes incorporated and fabtech in connection with these credit arrangements 
both amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility and the fabtech term loan bear interest at libor plus 
at december   the effective rate under both the credit agreement and the fabtech term loan was libor plus  or 
the credit agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio not greater than to  an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to and a current ratio of not less than to it also requires us to achieve a net profit before taxes  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  for the two consecutive fiscal quarters ending on that date of not less than the credit agreement permits us to pay dividends to our stockholders to the extent that any such dividends declared or paid in any fiscal year do not exceed an amount equal to of our net profit after taxes for such fiscal year 
however  it limits our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  engage in liquidation or merger  acquisition  partnership or other combination except permitted acquisitions 
the credit agreement also contains customary representations  warranties  affirmative and negative covenants and events of default 
the agreements governing the fabtech term loan do not contain any financial or negative covenants 
however  they provide that a default under our credit agreement will cause a cross default under the fabtech term loan 
as of december   fabtech had paid down million  to pay in full a note in favor of lsc  which debt was incurred in connection with our acquisition of fabtech from lsc in this note matured on june  and amortized monthly 
the obligations under this note were subordinated to the obligations under our us credit agreement with union bank 
diodes china and diodes taiwan have available lines of credit of up to an aggregate of million  with a number of chinese and taiwanese financial institutions 
these lines of credit  except for one taiwanese credit facility  are collateralized by its premises  are unsecured  uncommitted and  in some instances  may be repayable on demand 
loans under these lines of credit bear interest at libor or similar indices plus a specified margin 
as of december   diodes china owed million under a note to one of our customers  which debt was incurred in connection with our investing in manufacturing equipment 
we repay this unsecured and interest free note in quarterly price concession installments  with any remaining balance due in july off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that will affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  nor do we engage in leasing  hedging except for the interest rate swap agreement  which expired in november   or research and development services  that could expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of our financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table represents the company s contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total obligations there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as of december   as compared to december  inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal years through a significant increase in inflation could affect future performance 
recently issued accounting pronouncements and proposed accounting changes in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued 
the company does not anticipate a material impact on the financial statements from the adoption of this consensus 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r 
this new standard requires companies to adopt the fair value methodology of valuing stock based compensation and recognizing that valuation in the financial statements from the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will partially depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as shown in the stock based compensation table contained in note of our financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
we are currently evaluating several option valuation models in order to calculate the required compensation expense 
we have elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r on a modified prospective application method with no restatement of any prior periods 
sfas no 
r is effective for us as of the beginning of the fiscal year ending december  in december  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
in addition  this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this standard are effective for the fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its financial position and results of operations  but does not believe the impact of the change will be material 
on october   the american jobs creation act of was passed  which raised a number of issues with respect to accounting for income taxes 
in response  on december   the fasb issued two fasb staff positions  or fsp  fsp application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of and fsp accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  which became effective for us upon issuance 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  to be phased in from through  which is intended to replace the existing extra territorial income exclusion for foreign sales 
in fsp  the fasb decided the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas no 
 rather than as a rate reduction 
accordingly  any benefit from the deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax return 
no adjustment to deferred taxes was required 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have significant impact on company s consolidated financial statements 
the ajca also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the ajca 
fsp addresses when to reflect in the financial statements the effects of the one time tax benefit on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
under sfas no 
 companies are normally required to reflect the effect of new tax law changes in the period of enactment 
fsp provides companies additional time to determine the amount of earnings  if any  that they intend to repatriate under the ajca s provisions 
see note of our financial statements for more discussion of the impact of the ajca  including the impact on our repatriation of foreign earnings 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations 
the consensus provides guidance in determining which cash flows should be taken into consideration when assessing whether the cash flows of the disposal component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity  the types of involvement ongoing between the disposal component and the entity disposing of the component that constitute continuing involvement in the operations of the disposal component  and the appropriate re assessment period for purposes of assessing whether the criteria in paragraph have been met 
the consensus was ratified by the fasb at their november  meeting and should be applied to a component of an enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held for sale in fiscal periods beginning after december  we do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements from the adoption of this consensus 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 applying paragraph of fas in determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds 
the consensus states that operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds can be aggregated only if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  the segments have similar economic characteristics  and the segments share a majority of the aggregation criteria a e listed in paragraph of sfas no 
the effective date of the consensus in this issue is for fiscal years ending after october  the ratification of this issue did not have an impact on our financial reporting

in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  or fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  a revision to interpretation no 
fin r clarifies the application of consolidation accounting for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  these entities are referred to as variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin r are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin r also requires disclosure of significant variable interests in variable interest entities for which a company is not the primary beneficiary 
we have assessed diodes shanghai under the provisions of fin r and have concluded that our investment in diodes shanghai does not meet the criteria for consolidation under the standard 
however  diodes shanghai is consolidated under other applicable accounting literature 
we will periodically review our investment in diodes shanghai to insure that we comply with the guidelines prescribed by fin r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia 
our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan and the taiwanese dollar and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
because of the relatively small size and nature of each individual currency exposure  we do not regularly employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
therefore  we could experience currency gains and losses 
if the chinese yuan and the taiwanese dollar were to strengthen or weaken by against the us dollar  we would experience currency gains or losses of approximately  and  respectively 
in the future  we may enter into hedging arrangements designed to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations 
in july  the chinese government allowed the chinese yuan to float and be traded freely  although it is only permitted to float within a band against the chinese central bank rate set for the us dollar 
should the chinese government allow a significant chinese yuan appreciation  and we do not take appropriate means to offset this exposure  the effect could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
interest rate risk 
we have credit facilities with us and asian financial institutions as well as other debt instruments with interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to a portion of our long term debt 
the interest rate under the swap agreement was fixed at and was based on the notional amount of us million as of december  the swap contract was inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and was therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge was measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates 
at november  the interest rate swap agreement on our long term debt expired 
as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   our outstanding debt under our interest bearing credit agreements was million 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately  political risk 
we have a significant portion of our assets in mainland china and taiwan 
the possibility of political conflict between the two countries or with the united states could have an adverse impact upon the company s ability to transact business through these important business segments and to generate profits
