item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  manufacture  and market high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits utilizing state of the art high voltage dmos  hvcmos and hvbicmos analog and mixed signal technologies 
we supply standard and custom interface products primarily for use in the imaging  medical electronics markets  and telecommunications markets 
we also provide custom processing services for the manufacture of integrated circuits for customers using customer owned designs and mask toolings 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended april  april  april  net sales cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations interest and other income interest income other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates in these financial statements include revenue recognition  provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates for useful lives associated with long lived assets  asset impairments  net realizable value of inventories  certain accrued liabilities and provision for income taxes and tax valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in relation to this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a distributor agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
sales to our distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing limited rights of return  limited price protection and limited right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold by the distributors 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  we defer the recognition of such sales and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end user customers 
our distributors provide us an inventory balance report at the end of each period  which enables us to determine products sold to their end customer 
a small amount of our deferred revenue is from upfront billings from customers under non recurring engineering nre contracts as well as a customer advance under a licensing agreement 
we recognize revenue from our nre contracts upon completion of contract milestones  which corresponds to when we provide the services and or products 
revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of contract milestones  such as amounts received upon delivery of proto type  if such a delivery is an agreed upon milestone 
some of our nre contracts include formal customer acceptance provisions 
in this case  at the end of each period  we determine whether customer acceptance has been obtained for the specific milestone 
if customer acceptance has not been obtained  we defer the recognition of such revenue until customer acceptance is obtained 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analysis of outstanding return material authorization and allowance authorization data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due  to reduce our net receivable for such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example due to bankruptcy  etc in these cases  significant management judgements and estimates must be made  based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
second  a minimum allowance is established for all other customer receivables based on a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine net realizable value of our inventories based on the last selling price  net of selling cost  of our products prior to the balance sheet date 
if there has been no recent sale of a particular product  the expected selling price  net of selling cost is deemed as the net realizable value 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to net realizable value is charged to the cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
additionally  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand during the next fifteen months which involves a great deal of management judgment on our part 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are reserved 
in addition  we age our inventory based on start date 
inventory that has been inactive for more than one year is considered slow moving inventory and is also reserved 
additions to the provision are charged to the cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold  after which the related allowance is matched to the movement of the related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
while the company has programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and considers technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and will be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
accounting for investments and consolidation from time to time we may make investments in privately held companies  which require us to determine the carrying value of such investments 
we currently own stock in a privately held company whose carrying value is zero as of april  and april  investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded usually have no established market value 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing the cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition of each company 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as united states public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
in addition  adverse operating results of underlying long term investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimate change 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
such deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
the company must determine the probability that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that recovery is unlikely  then a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset must be recorded by increasing its income tax expense 
as of april   the company believes that its deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheet will be utilized 
however  should there be a change in its ability to utilize or recover its deferred tax assets  an additional income tax expense would be incurred in the period in which it was determined that the recovery is not probable 
we maintain within our income tax payable account reserves for tax contingencies 
the reserves amount was determined with considerable judgment and estimation  and is continuously monitored by management based on best information available including changes in tax regulations  the outcome of relevant court cases  and other information 
supertex is under irs examination for its fiscal tax return 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of the examination 
if the resulting tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
if payment proves unnecessary  the reversal of tax liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal  the global semiconductor industry conditions experienced a severe downturn that continued through the second half of fiscal during this time  conditions in all the markets we serve  particularly the telecom market  were weak 
demand for our products decreased  and sales were adversely impacted resulting in a sequential decline in fiscal years  and despite these declining sales  we remained profitable and generated positive cash flows through rigorous cost control measures 
we experienced a modest recovery in sales in the first half of fiscal  but we saw sales decline in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
starting fiscal  we experienced significant sales improvement partly due to the general economy and partly due to our many new products starting to ramp up production 
quote activity and design wins have been strong in all the markets we serve 
we have seen a higher sequential backlog and a book to bill ratio of greater than one  which are encouraging indicators for sales growth in the new fiscal year 
book to bill ratio is defined as sales orders received over orders shipped during the fiscal quarter 
we believe that current orders will be shipped in fiscal however  our customers may cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty  and the price of products may be adjusted between the time the purchase order is booked into backlog and the time the product is shipped to the customer  although these cases have been rare 
for these reasons  purchase orders received are not necessarily reliable indicators of future sales 
we believe that we will be able to substantially meet our production needs from our wafer fabrication and testing facilities in the coming fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales net sales for the fiscal year were  a increase compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the company operates in one business segment comprising the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and transistors 
the company has a broad base of customers  which in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple markets 
as such  the assignment of revenue to the aforementioned markets requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
actual results may differ from those reported 
a breakdown of our total sales to customers in the imaging  medical electronics  telecom and other markets as well as year over year changes are as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over markets april  april  year change imaging medical electronics telecom other net sales overall demand for our products in fiscal was higher compared to fiscal in three of our four major markets  which are imaging  medical electronics and telecom 
overall sales to the other market declined 
the increase in net sales of our three focused markets is primarily due to higher unit shipments across these markets as semiconductor market conditions improved and several of our new products  launched in fiscal and  began shipping in higher volumes faster than normal gestation periods 
the company did not have material sales price erosion on its products throughout fiscal sales to the imaging market in fiscal showed an increase of over the prior year primarily due to the continued increase in unit demand for el drivers for cellular phones 
the company is one of the key providers of el drivers for cell phones  pdas  and watches 
we forecast sales to this market to continue to grow in fiscal our new generation of inductor based inverters and our recently introduced inductorless inverters for space constrained applications  an industry first  will allow us greater market penetration in the watch and mp player markets where space is limited  as well as enhance our position with next generation products which are characterized by lower noise  brighter and better power efficiency 
sales of our el drivers for other products and non impact inkjet printers and plotters remained steady in fiscal supertex is the leading supplier in the high end industrial printer market  with both standard and custom products 
our sales to the medical electronics market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the sales increase is attributed to an increase in ultrasound units shipped  primarily due to an increasing ultrasound market worldwide 
in recent years  the ultrasound market experienced a significant growth in the transportable  hand carried ultrasound hcu units 
these high performance  portable  affordable systems are accelerating the proliferation of ultrasound imaging to medical specialties other than the traditional clinical applications 
geographically  the market is expanding as well  as china  korea and india are now designing and producing medical ultrasound machines 
the company believes that sales of our high voltage analog switches and multiplexers  high voltage pulser ics  high speed mosfet drivers  and discrete high voltage fets to this market will continue to increase as the ultrasound market continues to expand globally 
supertex is heavily investing in product development for the ultrasound market 
we expect to introduce more new integrated pulser ics as well as ultrasound receiver blocks 
custom high voltage pulsers are projected to contribute to our revenue growth in fiscal sales to the telecom market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales was the result of improving market conditions  and increased demand for dc to dc converters  long haul ring generators  line protection devices  hotswap ics  and high voltage amplifier arrays for the optical to optical telecom market 
the company projects increased sales of these newer products as customer production ramps up 
this increase is expected to offset a decline in sales of some of our older legacy products 
sales to the other market in fiscal decreased compared to prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to the shift in our focus to the development and marketing of new standard products from the lower margin foundry products 
the company s principal markets are in the united states  europe  and asia 
sales by geography as well as year over year change were as follows fiscal years ended year over dollars in thousands april  april  year change asia excl 
japan united states japan europe other total net sales net sales to international customers in fiscal were  or of the company s net sales as compared to  or of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
except for the united states  all geographical locations listed above posted higher sales as market conditions improved 
the decline in sales to our united states market was primarily caused by the continuing transfer of end customer manufacturing from north americas to international locations  mainly pacific rim region 
additional discussion regarding our sales based on geographic area can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support and net charges for excess or obsolete inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to higher sales and production 
gross margin  or gross profit as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributed to higher sales  an increase in plant capacity utilization  and to a lesser degree a favorable product mix  which consisted of higher sales of our newer products replacing declining sales of the lower margin foundry products 
depreciation expense in fiscal was slightly below fiscal level 
during fiscal  capital spending consisted primarily of replacement equipment 
the company had completed major upgrades of the wafer fabrication and test facilities in fiscal which generated sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future

this increase in overall net sales is primarily due to higher unit sales across these markets as semiconductor market conditions improved and the initial production ramp of our more recently introduced products 
the company did not have material sales price erosion on its products 
our sales to the medical electronics market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the sales increase is primarily attributed to an increase in ultrasound units shipped worldwide and to a lesser degree  from shipments of new products in the high voltage pulser area 
sales to the imaging market in fiscal showed a decrease of over the prior year primarily due to the reduced demand for the el backlighting products for monochrome displays in cellular phones 
in the third fiscal quarter  there was the start of a production ramp of our el backlighting products for backlighting keypads  but the ramp up was abruptly stopped in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the unexpected push out by a major customer 
sales of flat panel display products and non impact printers and plotters in our imaging group remained steady in fiscal sales to the telecom market in fiscal increased compared to prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales was the result of improving market conditions  and increased demand for dc to dc converters  long haul ring generators  protection devices and high voltage amplifier arrays for the optical to optical telecom market 
sales to other markets in fiscal increased compared to prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to increased custom processing shipments to a single customer whose end product is for the automotive market

the decline in sales to our european market was primarily caused by a slowdown at one major el segment lighting customer 
sales to our domestic customers increased during the same period primarily from higher demand for our standard products 
additional discussion regarding our sales based on geographic area can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support and charges for excess inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year whereas our sales only increased by  thus  most of our increase in gross profit dollars was due to increased efficiency in the operations and decreased depreciation expenses 
fiscal years ended dollars in thousands april  april  gross margin percentage included in gross margin percentage above gross margin benefit from sale of previously written down inventory percentage of net sales our gross margin  or gross profit as a percentage of sales  was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributed to lower depreciation charges  lower package assembly costs  and lower expense for process supplies and line maintenance 
declining capital spending in the last two years after the completion of major upgrades to the wafer fabrication facility and test operations resulted to a lower depreciation in fiscal compared to the prior year 
last time build of a custom product at a sole source packaging vendor in fiscal year caused an abnormal increase in package assembly cost during that period 
the absence of an abnormal assembly cost in fiscal provided a favorable effect to the gross margin 
continued cost measures resulted in lower expenses in process supplies and line maintenance
