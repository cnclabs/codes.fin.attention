item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we own and operate integrated interconnection facilities and diverse transport routes in the two gateway markets of new york new jersey and los angeles  designed to provide comprehensive broadband interconnectivity enabling the exchange of traffic over multiple networks 
we have experienced significant operating losses and net losses 
we expect to continue to experience such losses as we continue to operate our business 
we also have a limited operating history 
consequently  prospective investors have limited operating history and financial data upon which to evaluate our performance 
the telecommunications industry has experienced a period of uncertainty and rationalization 
we have been negatively impacted by the general economic environment and by the difficulties that impacted our industry 
expectations for growth in demand for broadband services did not materialize  resulting in significant excess capacity in existing communication networks 
this excess supply of bandwidth and the intense competition among industry participants produced substantial pressure on the pricing of our services with significant decreases in recurring monthly charges 
in addition  customer contracts and services have been cancelled  resulting in a loss of recurring revenues to us 
we are unable to determine the extent to which additional contracts or services that we provide to our customers will be cancelled  and we cannot forecast our ability to replace those cancelled contracts with new contracts 
as a result  our revenues  business operations and liquidity may continue to be negatively affected by the market environment 
factors affecting future operations revenues 
we generate revenues from selling network capacity and related services to other communications service providers 
revenues are derived from four general types of services on net transport services 
our transport services include the offering of broadband circuits on our metropolitan transport networks and fibernet in building networks fins 
over our metropolitan transport networks  we can provision circuits from one of our carrier hotel facilities to another carrier hotel facility or to an on net building via an interconnection with our fin in that building 
we can also provision circuits vertically between floors in a carrier hotel facility or an on net building 
off net transport services 
we provide our customers with circuits on networks that we do not own 
we sell this connectivity to our customers by purchasing the underlying circuits from other wholesale telecommunications carriers 
colocation services 
our colocation services include providing customers with the ability to locate their communications and networking equipment at certain of our carrier hotel facilities in a secure technical operating environment 
we can also provide our customers with colocation services in the central equipment rooms of certain of our on net and off net buildings 
communications access management services 
our access management services include providing our customers with the non exclusive right to market and provide their retail services to tenants in our on net and off net buildings 
our revenues are typically generated on a monthly recurring basis under contracts with our customers 
the terms of these contracts can range from month to month to fifteen years in length 
throughout and  we continued to experience a trend of entering into shorter term contracts with our customers 
our customers typically elect to purchase services on a month to month basis or for a contracted period of one year 
all of our revenues are generated in the united states of america 
our services are typically sold under fixed price agreements 
in the case of transport services  we provide an optical circuit or other means of connectivity for a fixed price 
revenues from transport services are not 
table of contents dependent on customer usage or the distance between the origination point and termination point of a circuit 
the pricing of colocation services are based upon the size of the colocation space or the number of colocation units  such as cabinets  provided to the customer 
revenues from access management services are typically determined by the square footage of the commercial office properties to which a customer purchases access 
we have experienced price declines for some of our services over the past year due to industry trends  with transport services experiencing the greatest decreases 
we expect our operating results to continue to be impacted by decreases in the prices of our services 
the growth of our revenue is dependent upon our ability to provide additional services in our existing facilities 
we also believe that the majority of the growth in our revenues will come from our existing customers 
consequently  our growth in revenue is dependent on the underlying growth of our customers businesses and their need for our services within the facilities that we already operate 
we continue to add additional customers  particularly domestic subsidiaries of internationally based carriers 
however  we believe the number of companies that are potential customers is decreasing  due to the industry rationalization 
in addition  we currently do not anticipate expanding our network infrastructure to other carrier hotel facilities or on net buildings and off net buildings 
within each of our existing facilities  our revenues will depend upon the demand for our services  the competition that we face and our customer service 
we typically begin our sales cycle by entering into a master services agreement 
this document outlines the operating specifications and commercial standards that are required of us by the customer 
customers can order a specific service  or  alternatively  they can purchase general availability on our networks or in our facilities on a recurring basis 
customers primarily purchase services from us only on an as needed basis  when their network requirements mandate an immediate need for additional services 
they have not elected to purchase general availability on our networks  nor have they purchased services on a speculative basis 
we have also experienced significant disconnections of transport services  as customers groom their networks to eliminate excess capacity 
this loss of revenues has had a significant negative impact on our financial results and may continue 
our transport services have been negatively impacted by customers disconnecting higher bandwidth circuits and replacing them with lower bandwidth circuits to more efficiently manage the access costs of their networks 
the new transport services that we are providing typically are also for lower bandwidth circuits  as our customers expand their network connections on a more limited basis 
the growth in transport revenues that we have experienced on a quarterly basis in and is a result of an increase in the number of circuits we have provisioned  offsetting our disconnections and price declines 
in the future  we anticipate generating significantly more of our revenues from transport services than from the other services we provide 
the scalability of our network architecture allows us to increase transport capacity to a greater degree than is possible with our other services 
our off net transport services provide our customers with circuits on networks that we do not own 
we purchase circuits from other wholesale telecommunications carriers and sell this connectivity to our customers 
we offer these services in markets that we currently serve  other metropolitan markets that we do not serve with our own networks  and on a long haul basis to connect metropolitan areas 
currently our colocation services produce approximately one quarter of our revenues 
our colocation services have not experienced the same level of disconnections and price declines as our transport services 
the physical constraints of available colocation space in our facilities and our competitors facilities have limited the supply imbalance that has developed in the connectivity market 
in addition  unlike the fluctuations in demand for bandwidth based upon end user usage  demand for colocation space is more stable because of the consistent need for a location to locate networking equipment 
as a result  prices for colocation have not decreased as much as those of transport  and carriers are less likely to terminate colocation contracts 
however  the growth prospects of our colocation services are not as great as those of our transport services  as we are limited in the amount of 
table of contents colocation space that we can sell without making a significant investment in an additional colocation facility 
our ability to expand the capacity of our transport networks is much greater due to technological advancements in fiber optics  such as dense wave division multiplexing or dwdm 
our access management services business has been steadily declining  and we expect that trend to continue 
the revenues that we are generating from this type of service are from long term contracts entered into in prior years 
we have experienced a significant decline in these services during we do not expect to sign any new contracts for access management in the near future 
the remaining terms of our existing access management service contracts range from a month to month basis to expiration in cost of services 
cost of services is associated with the operation of our networks and facilities 
the largest component of our cost of services is the occupancy expenses at our carrier hotel facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
these occupancy expenses primarily represent rent expense  utility costs and license fees under direct leases with landlords 
they also include charges for colocation space in other carriers facilities and cross connection fees to interconnect our networks with other carriers networks 
most of our license agreements for our on net and off net buildings require us to pay license fees to the owners of these properties 
in addition  our two leases at hudson street in new york city require us to pay license fees 
these license fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the revenues that we generate in each particular building 
in addition  we incur off net connectivity charges for the costs of purchasing connectivity from other wholesale telecommunications carriers to provide our customers with transport services on networks that we do not own 
as we provide additional off net transport services  we will purchase more connectivity from other carriers 
other specific costs of services include maintenance and repair costs 
with the exception of off net connectivity charges and license fees  we do not anticipate that cost of services will change commensurately with any change in our revenues as our cost of services is generally fixed in nature 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all of our personnel costs  occupancy costs for our corporate offices  insurance costs  professional fees  sales and marketing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
personnel costs  including wages  benefits and sales commissions  are our largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
all of our personnel costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we do not allocate any personnel cost relating to networks operations or sales activities to cost of services 
we had employees as of december  compared to as of december  prospectively  we believe that our personnel costs will increase moderately 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses and consulting fees  represent the second largest component of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
these legal and accounting fees are primarily attributed to our required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings and financial statement audits  and could increase prospectively due to the enhanced regulations regarding corporate governance and compliance matters 
other costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses  such as insurance costs  occupancy costs related to our office space  and marketing costs  may increase due to changes in the economic environment and telecommunications industry 
stock related expense 
stock related expense relates to the granting of stock options and restricted stock to our employees 
we make equity grants to our employees in order to attract  retain and incentivize qualified personnel 
these costs are non cash charges that are amortized over the vesting term of each employee s equity agreement  based on the fair value on the date of the grant 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of our network equipment and infrastructure  computer hardware and software  office equipment and furniture  and leasehold improvements  as well as the amortization of certain deferred charges 
we commence the depreciation of network related fixed assets when they are placed into service and depreciate those assets over periods ranging from three to twenty years 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results from operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  an allowance for doubtful accounts  the impairment of long lived assets and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when earned as services are provided throughout the life of each sales order with a customer 
the majority of our revenues are invoiced on a monthly recurring basis under sales orders that are typically one year in length 
certain of our contracts require us to invoice our customers for the periods ranging from one year to the full term of the contract 
we record deferred revenue for the amount of an invoice that has not been recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue is recorded for the full value of the contract at contract inception  only if we are contractually entitled to invoice the customer for the full value of the contract and the customer had paid such invoice 
we have one reciprocal agreement  whereby we purchase services from one of our customers under a single agreement 
the services provided and obtained through this agreement were priced at fair value as of the date of the agreement 
we recognized the transport and colocation revenues from this agreement in accordance with our stated revenue recognition policy  and we concurrently recorded the expenses for colocation services as cost of services in our consolidated statements of operations 
none of the expenses associated with our reciprocal agreement are capitalized 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
the reciprocal agreement accounted for million of revenue in each on the years ended december   and which represents  and of total revenue  respectively 
for each of the years ended december   and the reciprocal agreement accounted for million of our cost of services 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant number of our customers filed for bankruptcy or are otherwise in significant financial distress 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a further deterioration in the economic environment or telecommunications industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  we fully reserve the receivable and reverse that reserve only when collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates 
table of contents regarding future cash flows and other factors to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the telecommunications industry and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  we increased the number of our customers from at the end of to at the end of  primarily with the addition of many domestic subsidiaries of internationally based carriers 
we believe that there are greater opportunities to serve domestic subsidiaries of foreign telecommunications companies in our gateway markets  as domestic carriers consolidate and rationalize 
revenues were generated by providing transport  colocation and communications access management services to our customers and are broken down as follows for the year ended december  in thousands change change on net transport revenue off net transport revenue colocation revenue access revenue revenue from arbitration award total revenue we recognized million in on net transport service revenues in  up from million in off net transport service revenues for were million  up from million in revenues from colocation and other services were million in compared to million in  and revenues from communications access management services declined to million in from million in if we exclude the effect of the arbitration award  revenues of million for the year ended december  would have increased over the million in revenues for the year ended december  the vast majority of our transport and colocation services are provided within and between our carrier hotel facilities in the new york new jersey market 
on net transport revenues increased slightly as we provided a greater number of lower bandwidth circuits to our customers  offsetting the disconnections and price decreases that we have experienced due to industry trends 
off net transport revenues increased significantly over the same period as we leverage our current customer base across a broader addressable market 
colocation revenues were generated as we leased additional caged space  cabinets and racks in our facilities 
since we are approaching capacity at some of our colocation facilities  we may have to invest in expanding these facilities to offer additional space to our customers 
we expect transport services to grow at a faster rate than colocation 
our network infrastructure has significant capacity to provide additional broadband transport connectivity  and our colocation facilities are approaching more stabilized utilization rates 
our access management services business 
table of contents has been steadily declining  and we expect that trend to continue 
the revenues that we are generating from this type of service are from long term contracts entered into in prior years 
we have experienced a significant decline in these services during the remaining terms of our existing access management service contracts range from month to month to expiration in we do not expect to sell any additional access services  and we believe our existing contracts for access services may not be renewed when they expire 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in revenues due to an award from an arbitration proceeding  in which we were the prevailing claimant 
revenues recognized in connection with this award accounted for of total revenue for amounts disputed under the customer contract  which was the subject of the proceeding  were not recognized in prior periods as the collectability of amounts due under the contract was in doubt 
upon confirmation of the award  we recognized this amount as revenue during the year ended december  for services previously provided and earned 
of the total award payment  million related to payment for services previously provided and earned  and we recognized this amount as revenues during the year 
the remaining million was for the reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding 
we have recorded this reimbursement as a reversal of previously accrued expenses included in selling  general and administrative expenses in also in connection with this arbitration award  we recognized an additional million in revenues that were previously deferred 
we did not recognize revenues related to this arbitration proceeding or the disputed contract in prior periods as the collectability of amounts due under the contract was in doubt 
for fiscal years and  there were no individual customers that accounted for over of our total revenues 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in  consistent with million  or  of revenues in cost of services

other cost of services includes off net connectivity charges and maintenance and repair costs 
for the year ended december  in thousands change change occupancy expenses off net connectivity charges maintenance and repair and other costs total cost of services occupancy expenses represented of cost of services or million in  an increase of million as compared to or million in this increase was due to increases in colocation and cross connection charges and an increase in utility usage 
license fees  included in occupancy expenses  were of cost of services in  or million  compared to of cost of services in  or million 
license fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the revenues we generate in the respective facility  as per our lease agreement with the facility  and they are expensed in cost of services as the corresponding services are provided 
on september   we amended our lease agreements for our facilities at hudson street in new york city 
the amendments include a reduction in the license fee  and an increase in the total annual rent amount from million to million 
we expect the effect of these amendments will be a reduction in future rent expense at these facilities  as the reduction in the license fee percentage should offset the increase in base rent 
off net connectivity charges were of cost of services or million for the year ended december   compared to of the cost of services or million for the year ended december  we expect these connectivity charges to increase commensurately with our increase in revenues from off net transport 

table of contents maintenance and repair costs were or million of cost of services for the year ended december   compared to or million for the year ended december  these costs will continue to represent a relatively small and fixed component of cost of services 
our reciprocal agreement accounted for million of our cost of services for each of the years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for personnel costs represented of selling  general and administrative expenses in and in professional fees were of selling  general and administrative expenses in  compared to in we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in stock related expense 
stock related expense for each of the years ended december  and was million 
this non cash expense relates to the amortization of restricted stock granted to our employees 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment of million to reflect our revised business plan and forecast of revenues due to the early termination of a significant access agreement as well as other renegotiated building access service orders with other customers  which significantly reduced our future revenues from access services 
in  we settled a dispute with a dark fiber provider that had filed for bankruptcy  which resulted in the impairment of previously purchased dark fiber miles 
we agreed to concede our claim to unutilized dark fiber miles  or of the total dark fiber acquired from this provider in december for million 
we also agreed to pay million to settle a trade payable dispute with this provider  for which we had accrued million as a liability 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of million due to the write off of million of dark fiber included in network infrastructure  million of related accumulated depreciation and a million reduction in accrued liabilities from this settlement for charges for network infrastructure that were previously capitalized and impaired 
also during the year ended december   we did not renew two of our off net property leases 
as a result  we abandoned the assets associated with these two properties 
we recorded an impairment of million due to the write off of million of network infrastructure and million of related accumulated depreciation 
also during  we recovered million due to the disposition of equipment that was previously impaired 
impairment of goodwill 
during  our settlement agreement with a dark fiber provider required us to record an impairment to property  plant and equipment

 impairment and disposal of long lived assets  this asset impairment required us to perform a test for impairment of goodwill under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as such  we performed our test for the recoverability of goodwill from the acquisition of gateway colocation  and determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a million impairment for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization

for the year ended december  we used million in net cash for financing activities primarily for our repayment of notes payable of million  which was offset by our private placement of equity securities in january we believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in order to sustain our current and long term operations 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the operating assets of gateway 
realty 
new jersey 
llc  also known as gateway colocation 
gateway colocation operates a  square foot communications hub and colocation facility located at halsey street in newark  new jersey 
the transaction was structured as an acquisition of assets  and the purchase price paid at closing consisted of million shares of our common stock with a fair value of million on the closing date and approximately million in cash 
the purchase agreement also includes an earn out payment based upon the achievement of certain financial objectives with respect to the revenues generated by the facility 
more specifically  the earn out payment will be based on the gross revenues  on an annualized basis  for a particular month designated by gateway colocation during the twenty four month period immediately subsequent to closing 
the earn out payment  if payable  will be paid in shares of our common stock 
however  the issuance of such additional shares  in the aggregate with the shares of common stock issued on january   will not exceed of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the closing date without first receiving stockholder approval 
we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement covering the resale of the shares issued at closing  and have also agreed to file a registration statement with respect to the resale of shares issued  if any  pursuant to the terms of the earn out provision 
as of december   there were no additional shares required under the earn out provision
