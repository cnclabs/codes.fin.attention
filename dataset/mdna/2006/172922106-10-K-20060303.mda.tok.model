earnings overview vs 
net income in totaled  or per share basic  and per share diluted 
net income for was down from the corporation s lower earnings results reflected the impact of a flat yield curve  a significant increase in noninterest expense  and other factors 
despite substantial loan growth  the net interest margin increased only slightly in over as noted in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis  when calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income was lower by  in than in 
increases in short term interest rates contributed to a increase in interest expense  while relatively flat and at times  declining long term rates dampened the positive earnings effect of the growth in loans 
the impact of rising interest costs became especially apparent in the fourth quarter  as the interest margin fell to  from  in the third quarter 
further  in light of the flat yield curve  the opportunities were very limited for earning a positive spread from maintaining borrowed funds and holding investment securities 
accordingly  the december  balance of available for sale securities was  lower than the year end balance  and the december  balance of short term and long term borrowings was  lower than year end noninterest expense increased  in over total salaries and benefit expenses increased  or in over  primarily due to new hires to accommodate expansion into new branches and for several support functions 
furniture and equipment expense increased  or  mainly due to depreciation and maintenance costs associated with the new core banking software system  which was implemented in the fourth quarter the provision for loan losses increased  in over  mainly due to estimates of possible future charge offs on several large commercial loans  as well as volume related increases in the portions of the provision determined based on historical net charge off and subjective factors 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation realized a gain from the sale of credit card receivables of  after the sale  the corporation continues to offer credit cards through c n bank  but now as an agent for a national credit card issuer 
also in the fourth quarter  the corporation had net losses from sales of securities of  contributing to a  reduction in net securities gains in as compared to the fourth quarter losses were mainly from sales of securities that were purchased in and  when market yields were lower than current conditions 
other noninterest income totaled  in  an increase of  or  over this category includes several sources of revenue 
the sources of revenue with the largest increases in included the following fees related to credit card operations of  dividends from federal home loan bank of pittsburgh stock of  and debit card fees of  vs 
net income in was  or per share basic and per share diluted 
net income for was  lower than the  per share basic and per share diluted recorded in realized securities gains  net of realized losses  decreased  to  in from  in in both and the corporation sold selected bank stocks that management believed to be fully valued  generating substantial realized gains 
assuming an income tax rate of  the lower securities gains in reduced net income for by  from excluding the effects of lower securities gains  net income for was approximately lower than the amount recorded in the interest margin increased  or in from  in higher interest income  primarily from growth in loans  combined with lower interest expense  combined to drive the increase in the interest margin 
other noninterest operating expenses increased  or  in over overall  the increase in noninterest expenses resulted from start up of the williamsport and south williamsport facilities  the implementation of the core computer system conversion and other activities that resulted in more expense incidental to additional personnel and technology costs 
outlook for earnings for were impacted by significant factors that will probably continue to have an effect in continuation of a flat yield curve  for at least the first months of  and start up costs associated with our recent expansion and new facilities 
continuing tightening by the federal reserve eight increases in the fed funds target rate in  and another in january have driven up interest costs on deposits and borrowings  and will continue to do so for at least the first few months of as the short end of the yield curve has been rising  the long end has fallen slightly 
accordingly  competitive rates for loans and debt securities have not increased commensurately with the increase in funding costs 
management expects the expansion and investments in new markets to provide future  continuing opportunities for earnings growth 
in  however  expenses associated with new facilities  personnel and other start up costs  will affect earnings 
the estimated increase in salaries and benefit expenses associated with having a full year of operations in jersey shore which opened in august  and an estimated months of operations in the new facility in old lycoming township  is  further  depreciation and other occupancy expenses in from the new administration building in wellsboro and the old lycoming township facility  are estimated at approximately  another major variable that affects the corporation s earnings is securities gains and losses 
management s decisions regarding sales of securities are based on a variety of factors  with the overall goal of maximizing portfolio return over a long term horizon 
it is difficult to predict  with much precision  the amount of net securities gains and losses that will be realized in total capital purchases for are estimated to total approximately million  including approximately million to complete the wellsboro administration and old lycoming township facilities 
critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
the corporation s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing these fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
accordingly  when selling debt securities  management typically obtains price quotes from more than one source 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the large majority of the corporation s securities are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported separately through accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity 
net interest margin the corporation s primary source of operating income is represented by the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest margin in  and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
accordingly  the net interest margin amounts presented in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables 
the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  was  in  down  or  from as reflected in table iii  interest rate changes had the effect of decreasing net interest income  in as compared to  as rising short term interest rates caused increases in the corporation s interest expense on money market deposits  certificates of deposits and short term borrowings 
table iii also shows that increased interest income from higher volumes of earning assets primarily loans exceeded increases in interest expense attributable to higher volumes of interest bearing liabilities by  in compared to as presented in table ii  the interest rate spread excess of average rate of return on interest bearing assets over average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities was in  compared to in in  the net interest margin was  an increase of  or  over as reflected in table iii  increased interest income from higher volumes of earning assets exceeded increases in interest expense attributable to higher volumes of interest bearing liabilities by  in compared to table iii also shows that interest rate changes had the effect of increasing net interest income  in compared to as shown in table ii  the interest rate spread of in was up from in interest income and earning assets interest income increased  to  in from  in interest and fees from loans increased  or  while income from available for sale securities decreased  or 
overall  the majority of the increase in interest income resulted from higher volumes of loans  which more than offset the effect of the lower average volume of available for sale securities 
as indicated in table ii  average available for sale securities in amounted to  a decrease of from proceeds from sales and maturities of securities have been used  in part  to help fund the substantial growth in loans 
also  because short term interest rates have been rising faster than long term rates  there have been few opportunities to purchase mortgage backed securities or other bonds at spreads sufficient to justify the applicable interest rate risk 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities was for  slightly lower than the rate of return for tax exempt securities municipal bonds were a smaller portion of the corporation s earning assets in than in the average balance of municipal bonds shrunk to  in from  in management decided to reduce the corporation s investment in municipal bonds in order to reduce the potential for an alternative minimum tax liability that would otherwise have been expected for the average balance of gross loans increased in over  to  from  the acquisition of loans from first state bank  which were added to the corporation s balance sheet for the last months of contributed  of the growth in average loans 
the largest growth was in commercial loans  due in part to new personnel and relationships in williamsport and throughout lycoming county  as well as from growth in staffing and an increased emphasis on commercial lending throughout the corporation s market area over the last few years 
the average rate of return on loans was in  as compared to in as reflected in table ii  the average balance of available for sale securities increased  or in over  while the average yield of was comparable to the average yield of 
average loans increased  or  in over  reflecting growth in commercial lending that continued into the average yield on loans was  significantly lower than the average yield in of 
the lower average yield on loans in resulted from significant levels of mortgage refinancings that occurred in  and by lower average yields on commercial loans with variable or adjustable rates 
interest expense and interest bearing liabilities interest expense rose  or  to  in from  in table ii reflects the current trend in interest rates incurred on liabilities  as the overall cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities rose to in  from in in table ii  you can see the impact of rising short term interest rates on some of the corporation s largest sources of funds money market accounts  which increased to an average rate of in from in  certificates of deposit cds  which increased to an average rate of from  short term borrowings  which rose to an average rate of from  and interest checking accounts  which increased to an average interest rate of from 
helping to offset some of the impact of rising short term market rates were passbook individual retirement accounts iras  for which the average rate fell to from  and long term borrowings  for which the average rate fell to from 
in the first quarter  the average rate paid on the majority of the corporation s iras was  which was the floor on month passbook iras that existed prior to october  effective april   the floor on those iras fell to  and the corporation s passbook ira rate has ranged from to thereafter 
the decrease in average rate incurred on long term borrowings resulted from repayment of borrowings originated in earlier interest rate cycles at higher rates 
as you can calculate from table ii  total average deposits interest bearing and noninterest bearing increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
fluctuations in deposits of nonprofit and municipal customers impacted average deposit balances significantly in  as the corporation has both lost and gained customers with average balances exceeding million 
the acquisition of deposits from first state bank contributed  or  of the increase in average deposits 
average total short term and long term borrowed funds amounted to  in  down from  in in  the corporation utilized borrowings to fund security purchases and to help fund loan growth 
in  this trend has changed  as management has begun to use proceeds from the securities portfolio to help fund loan growth  and has either rolled over maturing long term borrowings into short term borrowing instruments at lower rates  or shrunk the balance sheet by paying off long term borrowings as they mature  without replacement 
this change in trend is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet  as total short term borrowings increased slightly  to  at december  from  at december   and total long term borrowings decreased to  at december  from  at december  interest expense fell to  in from  in as reflected in table iii  lower average rates had the effect of lowering interest expense  in the impact of lower rates more than offset the effects on interest expense of higher average balances of interest bearing liabilities in than in because of eliminating the floor on passbook iras  as noted above  the average rate incurred on iras fell to in from in also  the average rate incurred on cds was in  down from in table i analysis of interest income and expense year ended december  increase decrease in thousands interest income available for sale securities taxable    tax exempt     total available for sale securities     held to maturity securities  taxable interest bearing due from banks federal funds sold loans taxable      tax exempt    total loans      total interest income      interest expense interest checking money market     savings certificates of deposit     individual retirement accounts    other time deposits short term borrowings  long term borrowings     total interest expense     net interest income     interest income from tax exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis  using the corporation s marginal federal income tax rate of

noninterest income total noninterest income increased  or  in as compared to in  total noninterest income decreased  or  compared to the gain from sale of credit card loans  and fluctuations in amounts of net realized security gains in  and are discussed in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis 
excluding the effect of the credit card sale and net securities gains  noninterest income increased  or  in over  and  or  in over items of significance related to changes in other income are as follows vs 
service charges on deposit accounts fell slightly  to  in from  in throughout much of the first half of  changes in deposit account processing resulting from the new core banking system resulted in overdraft and other charges not being assessed for some transactions that would have generated charges with the former system 
management worked with the core system vendor  and during the third quarter was able to reestablish virtually all of the remaining  significant overdraft and service charge routines 
those changes  along with fee increases in overdraft and other services  helped restore service charge revenue for  on an annual basis  to a level almost as high as in other service charges and fees increased  or  in over  primarily from higher volumes of transactions  including letters of credit  atm surcharges and other transactions 
trust and financial management revenue decreased  to  in from  in the small decrease in revenue for occurred mainly because revenue for included more fees collected from settlements of estates 
much of the trust fees are determined based on the amount of assets under management  which have increased as of december  as compared to one year earlier  to  insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased  or  in over in the third quarter  bucktail recorded a catch up adjustment to recognize revenue for insurance premiums associated with policies issued related to collateral mortgage transactions 
overall  bucktail s operations are not a significant component of the corporation s operations 
the increase in cash surrender value of insurance fell  or  in as compared to the corporation s policy return is determined  in part  by the amount of earnings generated from a pooled separate investment trust held by the life insurance company 
in  earnings from that pooled separate trust fund were lower than in  which is reflective of lower market yields on debt securities 
fees related to the corporation s credit card operation increased  or  in over  primarily because of higher volumes and rates on merchant processing and interchange transactions 
within this category  the largest increase was in interchange fees  which increased  in  to  this source of revenue will not recur after  due to the sale of the credit card portfolio 
the second largest source of revenue within this category  merchant processing fees  increased  in  to  the corporation did not sell its merchant services as part of the credit card portfolio sale  and will continue to provide merchant processing services in other operating income increased  or  in over within this line item  the largest changes in were increases in the following categories dividends from federal home loan bank of pittsburgh stock  which increased  to  debit card fees  which increased  to  broker dealer revenues  which increased  to  and training grant revenue of  with none received in vs 
trust and financial management revenue rose  or for compared to trust and financial management revenue for included the effects of some large estate settlements  and also reflected growth in assets under management at december   as compared to december  the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance fell  to  in from  in as in  lower earnings on the policy were reflective of lower earnings from the pooled separate trust fund s holdings of debt securities

pensions and other employee benefit expenses increased  or  in over in the aggregate  total pensions and other employee benefits expense  as a percentage of salaries and wages  was  the same as in increases in numbers of employees drove up expenses for health insurance  contributions to the savings and retirement k plan and payroll taxes 
helping to mitigate some of the expense increases within this category were reductions in expense associated with the defined benefit plan and professional fees related to employee benefit plan matters 
more detail concerning the corporation s retirement plans is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements

depreciation expense also rose  from s level  as the corporation recorded depreciation on the new williamsport facility and on building renovation costs for several locations 
total energy costs increased  primarily due to higher utility rates in several locations  as well as the initial expenses associated with the williamsport and south williamsport facilities during furniture and equipment expense increased  or  in compared to the largest increase within this category was in depreciation expense  which increased  the depreciation expense related to the corporation s management information systems function increased  in  including  related to software and hardware for the new core system that was placed in service in october depreciation expense also increased due to the addition of computer equipment and furniture for the williamsport and south williamsport locations 
in addition to the increase in depreciation  maintenance and repairs expense increased  in  mainly due to maintenance contracts associated with the new software and hardware

these factors contributed to the corporation incurring an alternative minimum tax liability of  in a more complete analysis of income taxes is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition significant changes in the average balances of the corporation s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are described in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis 
that discussion provides useful information regarding changes in the corporation s balance sheet over the year period ended december   including discussions of available for sale securities  loans  deposits and borrowings 
the acquisition of canisteo valley corporation was effective at the end of august that transaction was an all cash acquisition  which had the effect of increasing the corporation s assets and liabilities 
at december   total consolidated assets of canisteo valley corporation amounted to  including net loans of  while deposits totaled  other significant balance sheet items the allowance for loan losses and stockholders equity are discussed in separate sections of management s discussion and analysis 
table vi shows the composition of the investment portfolio at december   and comparison of the amortized cost totals of available for sale securities at each year end presented reflects a reduction from  at december  to  at december   and then a further reduction to  at december  management s decision to reduce the size of the securities portfolio was attributable to primary factors substantial loan growth  and the need to manage interest rate risk within acceptable parameters 
specifically  in light of the flat yield curve  the opportunities have been very limited for earning a positive spread from maintaining borrowed funds and holding investment securities  and because there is almost no difference between short term and long term rates  the corporation faces the risk that excessive holdings of long term  fixed rate securities could result in future losses or diminished net interest margin results when the yield curve normalizes 
accordingly  management has utilized proceeds from principal repayments and sales of securities to help fund loan growth 
the corporation s liquidity position is discussed in a separate section of management s discussion and analysis  and interest rate risk is discussed in more detail in part ii  item a 
as described in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis  loans outstanding grew substantially in both and in fact  as reflected in table vii  the year end balance of loans  net of the allowance for loan losses  has grown more than compared to the previous year end  for each of the last years 
table viii presents a table of loan maturities 
fixed rate loans are included in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  while variable rate loans are included based on contractual principal repayments  with the remaining balance reflected in the table as of the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that the majority  or of the loan portfolio is fixed rate  including  or fixed rate beyond years 
this substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans is one of the major concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices 
see part ii  item a for a more detailed discussion of the corporation s interest rate risk 
premises and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased to  at december  from  at december  and  at december  a portion of the increase in premises in equipment in was related to the acquisition of canisteo valley corporation  which had a balance of  at december  the total cost of premises and equipment purchases excluding the canisteo acquisition was  in   in and  in the major capital purchases in were building related 
the total cost for land  building construction and furnishings for the jersey shore branch  which opened in august  was just over million  including approximately million of expenditures in construction in progress at december  had a balance of  including  related to the wellsboro administration and old lycoming township building projects 
in  capital purchases for management information system purposes totaled  including the new core banking software  as well as related software  network servers and other equipment 
also in  the corporation completed the renovation of the williamsport facility  and opened the branch in early june trust and commercial lending staff moved in a few months prior to the opening of the branch 
total cost allocated to the williamsport land and building amounted to  of which approximately  was incurred in with the remainder in capital purchases for furniture and equipment for operations in the williamsport facility amounted to  in in  the most significant projects included remodeling and addition to the sayre facility  remodeling of the elkland facility  and purchases of an additional thin client computer stations for teller lines throughout the branch network 
depreciation expense increased to  in  from  in and  in total capital purchases for are estimated at approximately million 
in light of the corporation s strong capital position and ample sources of liquidity  management does not expect capital expenditures to have a material  detrimental effect on the corporation s financial condition in as discussed in the outlook for section of management s discussion and analysis  depreciation and other occupancy expenses in from the new administration building in wellsboro and the old lycoming township facility  are estimated at approximately  and the corporation will incur payroll and other start up costs associated with its new branch locations 
the overall impact on the corporation s earnings in and thereafter will depend on the corporation s ability to build market share and produce profitable results from those locations  and how long that will take

the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
in evaluating collectibility  management considers a number of factors  including the status of specific impaired loans  trends in historical loss experience  delinquency trends  credit concentrations  comparison of historical loan loss data to that of other financial institutions and economic conditions within the corporation s market area 
allowances for impaired loans are determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense  and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
each quarter  management performs a detailed assessment of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
for c n bank  this assessment is conducted under the direction of the chief financial officer and executive vice president in charge of commercial lending  with input from the credit administration department  other branch and lending staff  and the chief executive officer 
the assessment process includes review of identified risk elements in the loan portfolio  including the watch list  past due reports and other information 
the watch list is a collection of loans that have a history of delinquency  collateral deficiency  cash flow problems  or other factors that have come to management s attention to create the need for special monitoring 
one of the key aspects of the quarterly assessment is the evaluation of each watch list relationship with an outstanding balance of  or more 
this evaluation includes an updated assessment of collection activities and planning for each such relationship  as well as evaluation of the probable loss if any 
for first state bank  the fourth quarter assessment was performed for all watch list relationships of  or more 
both c n bank and first state bank also engage consulting firms  at least annually  to perform independent credit reviews of large credit relationships 
management gives substantial consideration to the classifications and recommendations of the independent credit reviewers in determining the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses reflects probable losses resulting from the analysis of individual loans and historical loss experience  as modified for identified trends and concerns  for each loan category 
the historical loan loss experience element is determined based on the ratio of net charge offs to average loan balances over a three year period  for each significant type of loan  modified for qualitative risk adjustment factors identified by management for each type of loan 
the charge off ratio and qualitative factors are then applied to the current outstanding loan balance for each type of loan net of other loans that are individually evaluated 
prior to the fourth quarter  c n bank had utilized the ratio of net charge offs to average balances over a five year period in calculating the historical loan loss experience portion of the allowance portfolio 
management made the change to the three year assumption  which had very little effect on the allowance valuation as of december   mainly because management believes net charge off experience over a year period may be more representative of losses existing in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in the second quarter  management changed its process for determining and disclosing the components of the allowance for loan losses 
a management committee evaluated several qualitative factors  including economic conditions  lending policies  changes in the portfolio  risk profile of the portfolio  competition and regulatory requirements  and other factors 
this analysis was performed separately for the following categories of lending activity commercial  mortgage  consumer and credit card 
the management committee met again in the third and fourth quarters and updated its analysis excluding credit card  for which substantially all of the loans were sold in the fourth quarter 
based on the results of these evaluations  allocations were made to the components of the allowance shown in table x 
in periods prior to june   the portion of the allowance determined by management s subjective assessment of economic conditions and other factors was reflected completely in the unallocated component of the allowance 
primarily as a result of this change in process  table x shows the amounts allocated to the allowance for commercial  consumer mortgage and consumer loans at december  have increased in comparison to the corresponding amounts at december   while the unallocated portion of the allowance decreased to at december  from  at december  as indicated in table xi  total impaired loans amounted to  at december   as compared to  at december  and  at december  in total  the valuation allowance related to impaired loans amounted to  at december   up from  at december  and  at december  table xi also shows that the amount of loans classified as nonaccrual amounted to  at december   as compared to  at december  and  at december  the growth in in past due and nonaccrual loans resulted mainly from certain large commercial loan relationships  including one commercial loan relationship with total outstanding loan balances of approximately million at december   and million as of december  in  management moved most of the loans outstanding related to this large relationship to nonaccrual status 
also  in  a large  residential mortgage loan to the principal owner of this relationship was moved to nonaccrual 
as of december   the valuation allowances related to these loans totaled  up from  at december  there is another commercial loan relationship with total outstanding balances of approximately million that was classified as impaired and nonaccrual throughout most of and all of  and for which the valuation allowance was increased to  as of december  from  as of december  management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss and nonaccrual status 
however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances estimated as of december  management continues to closely monitor these commercial loan relationships  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate 
the allowance for loan losses was  at december   an increase of  from the balance of  at december  table ix shows that gross charge offs totaled  and net charge offs totaled  in these amounts were higher than the corresponding totals for of  gross charge offs and  net charge offs 
table ix also shows that the allowance for loan losses recorded as part of the canisteo valley corporation first state bank acquisition amounted to  although there were loans included on first state bank s watch list as of the acquisition date that management was monitoring  substantially all of these loans were commercial loans with low balances  or consumer or residential mortgage loans that can be collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  there were no acquired loans that were classified individually as impaired 
the provision for loan losses amounted to  in   in and  in the amount of the provision in each year is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of the factors described above

liquidity liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost 
an adequate liquidity position permits the corporation to pay creditors  compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand 
the corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day to day liquidity 
also  the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with fhlb pittsburgh  secured by various securities and mortgage loans 
at december   the corporation had unused borrowing availability with correspondent banks and fhlb pittsburgh totaling approximately  additionally  the corporation uses repurchase agreements placed with brokers to borrow funds secured by investment assets  and uses reposweep arrangements to borrow funds from commercial banking customers on an overnight basis 
historically  one of the tools used to monitor a bank s longer term liquidity situation has been the loan to deposit ratio 
as of december  and  this ratio was  which is an average ratio by banking industry standards  but higher than the corporation s position had been in many years 
the higher than historical level of loans to deposits reflects the corporation s very strong loan growth over the past few years 
the loan to deposit ratio was at december   at december  and at december  management believes the current  higher loan to deposit ratio provides opportunities for a higher average yield on earning assets  but is an indicator that some of the corporation s historical liquidity cushion has been reduced  however  the current position continues to provide sufficient funds for maintenance of a substantial investment securities portfolio 
if required to raise cash in an emergency situation  the corporation could sell non pledged investment securities to meet its obligations 
at december   the carrying value of non pledged securities was  management believes the combination of its strong capital position discussed in the next section  ample available borrowing facilities and moderate loan to deposit ratio have placed the corporation in a position of minimal short term and long term liquidity risk 
stockholders equity and capital adequacy the corporation and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
for many years  the corporation and c n bank have maintained extremely strong capital positions  and first state bank is also well capitalized 
details concerning the corporation s and the banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as reflected in note  at december  and  the ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average total assets are well in excess of regulatory capital requirements 
the corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available for sale securities 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  is classified as accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
changes in accumulated other comprehensive income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity 
comprehensive income comprehensive income is a measure of all changes in the equity of a corporation  excluding transactions with owners in their capacity as owners such as proceeds from issuances of stock and dividends 
the difference between net income and comprehensive income is termed other comprehensive income 
for the corporation  other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
comprehensive income should not be construed to be a measure of net income 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive income may vary widely from period to period  depending on the financial markets as a whole and how the portfolio of available for sale securities is affected by interest rate movements 
total comprehensive income was  in   in and  in other comprehensive loss amounted to  in   in and  in inflation the corporation is significantly affected by the federal reserve board s efforts to control inflation through changes in interest rates 
as discussed in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis  rising short term interest rates  which were triggered by the federal reserve s actions to increase the fed funds target rate several times  hurt the corporation s operating results for further concerns over the possibility of inflation could lead to further increases in the fed funds target rate  which management believes would continue to squeeze the net interest margin 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the corporation s two major categories of market risk  interest rate risk and equity securities risk  are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
c n bank uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
only assets and liabilities of c n bank are included in management s monthly simulation model calculations 
since c n bank makes up more than of the corporation s total assets and liabilities  and because c n bank is the source of the most volatile interest rate risk  presently management does not consider it necessary to run the model for the remaining entities within the consolidated group 
management intends to add first state bank s data to the model  beginning sometime in for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
c n bank s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
c n bank s policy provides limits at  and basis points from current rates for fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario 
the policy also limits acceptable market value variances from the baseline values based on current rates 
as the table shows  as of december   the decline in net interest income and market value exceed the policy threshold marks if interest rates were to immediately rise or basis points 
the table also shows that  at december   the changes in net interest income and market value were within the policy threshold for all calculations except that the market value decline exceeded the limit in the basis point scenario 
these out of policy positions are a reflection of the corporation s liability sensitive position on average  deposits and borrowings reprice more quickly than loans and debt securities 
management has reviewed these positions with the board of directors monthly throughout and  and management will continue to evaluate whether to make changes to asset and liability holdings in an effort to reduce exposure to rising interest rates 
the table that follows was prepared using the simulation model described above 
the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest margin and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates

also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
further  because of the concentration of its holdings in pennsylvania banks  these investments could decline in value if there were a downturn in the state s economy
