we sell the xbox video game console and games  pc games  and pc peripherals 
online communication and information services are delivered through our msn portals and channels around the world 
our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers 
our home and entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season 
typically  home and entertainment has generated over of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter 
we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future 
we intend to sustain the long term growth of our businesses through technological innovation  engineering excellence  and a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners 
recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide pc adoption and software upgrades  we continue to advance the functionality  security  and value of windows operating systems

table of contents part ii item worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software  services  games and internet service offerings 
we expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as open source software development and distribution evolves  we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competing products that are based on open source software 
we believe that microsoft s share of server unit operating systems increased in fiscal year summary of results for fiscal years   and in millions  except percentages percent change versus percent change versus revenue operating income our revenue growth for fiscal year was driven primarily by growth in sql server following the launch of sql server in the second quarter  windows server and other server applications  increased xbox revenue resulting from the xbox launch in the second quarter  growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems  and increased licensing of office and other information worker products 
based on our estimates  total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately to and total server hardware shipments grew approximately to during fiscal year foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year 
revenue growth for fiscal year was driven by growth in licensing of windows server operating systems and other server applications  licensing of windows client operating systems through oems  and increased licensing of office and other information worker products 
the november launch of the halo xbox game also contributed to overall revenue growth for the company 
total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately to and total server hardware shipments grew approximately to during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in  primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies  particularly the euro and japanese yen  against the us dollar 
partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a billion decline in earned revenue from upgrade advantage in fiscal year this revenue was recognized over fiscal year and fiscal year and in the first quarter of fiscal year when the contract period expired 
fiscal year revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems  windows server operating systems  office and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments 
the worldwide pc shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at and the windows server shipment was estimated at in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the us dollar 
this resulted in approximately billion growth in total revenue 
operating income for fiscal year increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies 
these changes were partially offset by a billion increase in cost of revenue primarily related to xbox and a billion increase in sales and marketing expense primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launch related spending 
headcount related costs  including stock based compensation expense  increased million or resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a growth in headcount over the past twelve months 
stock based compensation expense decreased million or reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense 
operating income increased in fiscal year due to a decline in stock based compensation expense  increased revenue in server and tools  client and information worker  which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments  and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation 
in addition  strong sales of halo reduced the overall operating loss for the home and entertainment segment for fiscal year the billion decrease in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount 
general and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year due to the billion of charges related to the settlement of sun page 
table of contents part ii item microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the european commission in fiscal year this effect was partially offset by legal expenses of billion related to settlements with ibm  novell  gateway  and end user class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters 
in fiscal year  the operating income decline was caused primarily by billion of legal charges and billion of stock based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program  mainly offset by an increase in revenue 
we implemented changes in employee compensation in fiscal year whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options 
we also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of or higher to jpmorgan chase bank jpmorgan 
the unvested options that were transferred to jpmorgan became vested upon the transfer 
a total of million of the million eligible options were transferred  which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of billion in the second quarter of fiscal year as a result of these changes  stock based compensation expense decreased in fiscal years and  and we expect stock based compensation expense related to stock options to continue to decrease in fiscal year fiscal year outlook in fiscal year  we expect continued double digit revenue growth primarily as a result of the upcoming launches of windows vista and the microsoft office system 
we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between and 
we expect that pc unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets 
we estimate worldwide server unit shipments will grow between and in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we do not expect a significant impact from year over year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year we expect our operating income growth rate to lag our revenue growth rate in the first half of fiscal year due to an increasing mix of xbox console revenue and related costs  coupled with significant investments in preparation for the launches of our flagship products 
we expect this trend to reverse in the second half of the fiscal year when we expect operating income to grow faster than revenue

for fiscal year  net recognized gains on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments  net losses on sales of fixed income investments and other than temporary impairments on both equity and fixed income investments 
net recognized gains decreased in fiscal year primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixed income investments  higher other than temporary impairments and fewer net gains on equity investments in the current period as compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  other than temporary impairments were million  as compared to million in fiscal year the increase in other than temporary impairments in fiscal year was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the billion tender offer announced on july  net gains on investments declined million in fiscal year primarily due to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on december  net gains on investments also include other than temporary impairments of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net realized gains on sales were billion in fiscal year as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  among other factors  we evaluate general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established

net losses on derivatives were as follows in millions net gain losses on equity derivatives net gains on commodity derivatives net losses on interest rate derivatives net losses on foreign currency contracts net losses on derivatives during fiscal year  we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year primarily due to net gains on non designated equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to net losses in the prior page 
table of contents part ii item fiscal year and higher net gains on commodity positions in the current fiscal year driven by increases in the related commodity indices 
these gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts 
the net gains on equity derivatives during fiscal year are primarily due to changes in the market value of non designated equity derivatives 
gains and losses arising from non designated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains  respectively  in the underlying equity securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification 
net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues

these guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value 
as of june   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists

elective retrospective application is also permitted 
we are currently evaluating the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  impairment of goodwill  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis  the fair value of which is recognized over the product s estimated life cycle 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sec sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected benefit from the combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach

 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material  and accordingly  we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  fixed income  equity  and commodity price risks 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily with option contracts 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
fixed income securities are subject primarily to interest rate risk 
the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 
securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk  and are generally not hedged 
however  we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 
commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk 
we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model used for currencies  equities  and commodities is geometric brownian motion  which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures 
for interest rate risk  exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed income security prices revert to maturity value over time 
var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding s market value to a range of over  equity  fixed income  foreign exchange  and commodity risk factors 
the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings  taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices 
the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the percentile confidence level or  alternatively stated  the losses could exceed the var in out of  cases 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  credit risk  and legal risk 
certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes 
we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars 
in these arrangements  we hedge a security s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security s appreciation above the sold call strike  in exchange for the premium received for the sold call 
we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes 
we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods 
at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year  we changed the methodology we use to calculate var 
we previously used a monte carlo simulation based methodology to calculate var 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we adopted a factor based parametric methodology 
the factor based parametric methodology can be performed more frequently resulting in more timely data  divides the aggregated var into its component risk factor groups  and is incrementally more accurate than the previously used simulation based methodology in evaluating diversification effects of commodity risk factors and interactions between equity and currency factors 
while we believe the efficiencies gained by changing to the parametric methodology are significant  we do not believe this methodology produces results that are significantly different from the simulation based methodology 
the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio 
losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis 
var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 
var numbers are shown separately for interest rate  currency rate  equity price  and commodity price risks 
these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges 
we use historical data to estimate var 
given the reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk
