item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sells interment rights grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise such as markers and memorials 
as of december   we operated funeral homes in states and cemeteries in states within the united states 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
factors affecting our funeral operating results include demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age  which impact death rates and number of deaths  establishing and maintaining leading market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships  effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by packaging complementary services and merchandise  controlling salary and merchandise costs  and exercising pricing leverage related to our at need business to increase average revenues per contract 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately of the average revenue earned from a traditional burial service 
funeral homes have a relatively fixed cost structure 
thus small changes in revenues  up or down  normally cause significant changes to our profitability 
we implemented several significant long term initiatives in our funeral operations at the beginning of designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model that included operating and financial standards developed from our best funeral operations  along with an incentive compensation plan to reward business managers for successfully meeting or exceeding the standards 
the operating model and standards  which we refer to as being the best  focus on the key drivers of a successful funeral operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
the model and standards are the measures by which we judge the success of each funeral business 
the cemetery operating results are affected by the size and success of our sales organization because approximately of our cemetery revenues for the year ended december  relate to sales of grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise and services before the time of need 
we believe that changes in the level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items also affect the amount of cemetery revenues 
approximately of our cemetery revenues for the year ended december  are attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
changes in the capital markets and interest rates affect this component of our cemetery revenues 
we are implementing operating and financial standards in our cemetery operations in similar to the funeral operations discussed above 
the standards are organized around market share  people and operational and financial metrics to improve the long term success of the cemeteries 
prior to  we accumulated a large amount of debt and contingent obligations from acquisitions 
our business strategy during the four years ended december  focused on increasing operating cash flow and improving our financial condition by reducing debt to lower our interest expense and improve our credit profile 
we have not been actively seeking businesses to acquire  instead we have been focused on selling underperforming businesses and reducing our debt 
we have sold funeral homes and cemeteries along with parcels of excess real estate 
we have reduced our debt and contingent obligations by approximately million during the period january  through december  during january  we refinanced our senior debt by issuing million of senior notes due in this refinancing represented a milestone 
the refinancing was the culmination of the effort to reaccess the capital markets and to extend the maturities of our senior debt and to gain the flexibility to reinvest our cash flow in our core business 
we plan to use the net cash proceeds from the offering and our cash flow to grow our company through selective acquisitions 
we ended the year with approximately million in cash and short term investments  primarily from the proceeds of the senior notes and positive cash flow 
during september  we acquired a funeral business consisting of two chapels in northern florida  the first acquisition since we changed our method of accounting for preneed selling costs in which affects the comparability of the costs and expenses in the results of operations 
the cumulative impact of the change was a charge in the amount of million  net of tax  equal to per diluted share 
see the following section  accounting method change  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those 
table of contents related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  because there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained consistently from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral merchandise and services when the funeral service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenue from the sales of cemetery merchandise and services are recognized in the period in which the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
revenues to be recognized from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by the company and are likely to exceed the cash collected from the contract and received from the trust at maturity 
allowances for customer cancellations  refunds and bad debts are provided at the date that the contract is executed 
in addition  we monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is usually one year after the policy is issued 
preneed selling costs consist of sales commissions and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts 
prior to  these costs were deferred and amortized into funeral and cemetery costs and expenses over the period we expect to perform the services or deliver the merchandise covered by the preneed contracts 
the periods over which the costs were recognized were based on actuarial statistics for the actual contracts we hold  provided by a third party administrator 
beginning in  we changed our method of accounting for preneed selling costs 
preneed selling costs are now expensed as incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  as determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases  is recorded as goodwill 
many of the acquired funeral homes have provided high quality service to families for generations 
the resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business 
goodwill is typically not associated with or recorded for the cemetery businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on reporting units aggregated geographically to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the businesses in each reporting unit at the company s weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the reporting unit and by reference to recent sales transactions of similar businesses 
the calculation of fair value can vary dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed  inflation in costs  and the company s cost of capital  which is impacted by long term interest rates 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate income tax returns in the states in which we operate 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 

table of contents stock compensation plans the company has four stock incentive plans under which stock options have been issued 
additionally  the company sponsors an employee stock purchase plan espp under which employees can purchase common stock at a discount 
the stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the company s common stock 
substantially all of the options granted under the four stock option plans have ten year terms 
the options generally vest over a period of two to four years 
the company accounts for stock options and shares issued under the espp under apb opinion no 
 under which no compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
had the company accounted for stock options and shares pursuant to its employee stock benefit plans under sfas no 
for the years ended december  and  net income for those periods would have been lower by approximately for each period 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values and the pro forma disclosure alternative is no longer allowable under statement r 
the revised standard is effective in the first annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company will adopt fas no 
r in the first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year and expects to use the modified prospective application method  which results in no restatement of the company s previously issued annual consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of fas no 
r using the modified prospective applications method is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position and no impact on cash flows of the company 
the future compensation expense will vary in the future due to changes in the number  value and vesting terms of stock based instruments granted to employees 
management currently estimates that the adoption of fas no 
r will reduce net income in within a range of million to million 
we have also granted restricted stock to certain officers of the company  which vest over a period of four years 
these shares are valued at the dates granted and the value is charged to operations as the shares vest 
impairment of long lived assets except as noted for goodwill  the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the net asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
the revenues and expenses  as well as gains  losses and impairments  from those assets are reported in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
preneed funeral and cemetery trust funds the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 as revised  fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation clarifies the circumstances in which certain entities that do not have equity investors with a controlling financial interest must be consolidated by its sponsor 
the company implemented fin r as of march   which resulted  for financial reporting purposes  in the consolidation of the company s preneed and perpetual care trust funds 
the investments of such trust funds have been reported at market value and the company s future obligations to deliver merchandise and services have been reported at estimated settlement amounts 
the company has also recognized the non controlling financial interests of third parties in the trust funds 
there was no cumulative effect of an accounting change recognized by the company as a result of the implementation of fin r 
the implementation of fin r affected certain accounts on the company s balance sheet beginning march  as described below  however  it does not affect cash flow  net income or the manner in which we recognize and report revenues 
although fin r requires consolidation of preneed and perpetual care trusts  it does not change the legal relationships among the trusts  the company and its customers 
in the case of preneed trusts  the customers are the principal beneficiaries 
in the case of perpetual care trusts  the company does not have a right to access the corpus in the perpetual care trusts 
for these reasons  the company has recognized non controlling interests in our financial statements to reflect third party interests in these consolidated trust funds 

table of contents both the preneed trusts and the cemetery perpetual care trusts hold investments in marketable securities which have been classified as available for sale 
the investments are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses allocated to non controlling interests in trust investment in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses attributable to the company  but that have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise  are allocated to deferred revenues 
also beginning march   the company began recognizing the income  gains and losses of the preneed trusts and the unrealized income  gains and losses of the cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the company recognizes a corresponding expense equal to the recognized earnings of these trusts attributable to the non controlling interest holders 
when such earnings attributable to the company have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise  the company will record such earnings as deferred revenue 
for preneed trusts  the company recognizes as revenues amounts attributed to the non controlling interest holders and the company  including accumulated earnings  when the contracted services have been performed and merchandise delivered 
for cemetery perpetual care trusts  the company recognizes investment earnings in cemetery revenues when such earnings are realized and distributable 
such earnings are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs incurred by the company 
accounting changes the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas no 

this statement is a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
and fas no 
fas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable and in the absence of explicit transition requirements  retrospective application as the required method of a change in accounting principle to the newly adopted accounting principle 
also  it establishes guidance for reporting corrections of errors as reporting errors involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting accounting changes retrospectively 
fas no 
also provides guidance for determining and reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
fas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in the fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt the requirements beginning january   which is not expected to have an effect on the company s financial statements 
accounting method change preneed selling costs on june   the company changed its method of accounting for deferred obtaining costs  which are preneed selling costs incurred  for the origination of prearranged funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales contracts 
prior to this change  commissions and other direct selling costs related to originating preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales contracts were deferred and amortized with the objective of recognizing the selling costs in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
under the prior accounting method  the commissions and other direct selling costs  which are current obligations are paid and use operating cash flow  are not recognized currently in the income statement 
the company believes it is preferable to expense the current obligation for the commissions and other costs rather than defer these costs 
the company also believes the new accounting method improves the comparability of its reported earnings with other public companies in the death care industry 
because the three largest public death care companies now expense selling costs two of which changed in  investors and other users of the financial information will now be able to more easily compare our financial results to those deathcare companies 
the company has applied this change in accounting method effective january  as of january   the company recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting method of million pretax or million after tax net of income tax benefit of million  or per diluted share  which represents the cumulative balance of deferred preneed selling costs in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
therefore  the company s results of operations for the year ended december  is reported on the basis of our changed method 
the annual impact on earnings per diluted share is approximately 
the change has no effect on cash flow from operations 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for the change in accounting method for preneed selling costs and comparison of results as reported in this annual report and under the previous method

if we are not able to meet these obligations with cash provided for by our operating activities  we may be required to access the capital markets or draw down on our credit facilities 
additionally  we are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to the purchase or sale of business assets  commercial contracts and operating leases and arose through representations and warranties eg  ownership of assets or environmental matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
seasonality the company s business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  the rate is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of carriage s operations 
forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include any projections of earnings  revenues  asset sales  cash flow  debt levels or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operation  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure carriage is exposed to market risk primarily related to potential increases in interest rates related to the company s debt  decreases in interest rates related to the company s short term investments and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
carriage monitors current and forecasted interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business and seeks to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
as of december   approximately of total debt is fixed rate obligations 
given the current outlook for increasing interest rates  we believe the current bias to fixed rate debt is appropriate 
we do not currently have any floating rate long term borrowings outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit 
if we borrow against the line of credit  any change in the floating rate would cause a change in interest expense 

table of contents the senior notes were issued at par and are carried at a cost of million 
current quotes indicate that cost approximates market value 
the convertible junior subordinated debenture payable to carriage services capital trust pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on the company s balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
we estimate a value of million and million at december  and  respectively  based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect the company s interest costs 
the remainder of carriage s long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  or otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by our preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see note and to our consolidated financial statements for the estimate of the fair values of those securities
