executive overview we were incorporated in california in and became a public company in we currently operate in two operating segments video and digital imaging 
in our video business  we design  develop and market highly integrated analog and digital processor chips and digital amplifiers 
our digital processor chips are the primary processors driving digital video and audio devices  including dvd  video cd vcd  consumer digital audio players  and digital media players 
we also continue to sell certain legacy products we have in inventory including chips for use in modems  other communication devices  and pc audio products  although we no longer invest in these product lines 
in our digital imaging business  we design  develop and market highly integrated imaging sensor chips and camera lens modules 
we focus on our design and development strengths and outsource all of our chip fabrication and assembly as well as the majority of our test operations 
we market our products worldwide through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
substantially all of our sales are to customers in hong kong  taiwan  korea  japan  turkey and singapore 
we employ sales and support personnel located outside of the united states in china  taiwan  hong kong  korea  japan and france to support these international sales efforts 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues 
in addition  substantially all of our products are 
table of contents manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
we also have a number of employees engaged in research and development efforts outside of the united states 
there are special risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states 
see item a risk factors we have significant international sales and operations that are subject to the special risks of doing business outside the united states 
we were incorporated in california in and became a public company in on june   we acquired of the outstanding of pictos technologies  inc  a delaware corporation pictos which formed the building block of our digital imaging segment 
on august   we acquired of the outstanding shares of divio  inc  a california corporation divio 
see note  significant business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our financial results for fiscal year ended december  were impacted by a very competitive digital media marketplace in which several large and capable companies compete for the world wide digital video and image sensor business through a combination of innovative new products  feature enhancements to existing products  customer service  quality enhancements and reduced prices 
the highly competitive nature of our markets in accelerated the introduction of new products to the market and aggressively drove the price of our products down 
for example  in the video business  the average price of our dvd products declined in from in addition our vcd market is shrinking as demand for those products are being replaced by demand for competitively priced dvd products  resulting in a decline in vcd revenue in in response to these trends in our industry  we have been focusing our development efforts on our next generation dvd and digital imaging products and expect to launch several new products to address those markets in in addition  we have reduced operating expenses by approximately million not including impairment of goodwill charges from our levels 
gross margins in were greatly impacted by this competitive environment and stood at in compared to in without royalty payments  margins from product sales were a negative in compared with a positive in our and financial results included million royalty income from the mediatek legal settlement in these royalty payments concluded in the fourth quarter of and were reflected in our net revenue  gross margin  net income and cash flow results in and our future results  in and beyond  will not have the benefit of this royalty income stream 
our financial results for the fourth quarter ended december  were impacted by seasonal demand for our products and the continued decline in the demand for vcd products  vcd revenues declined in the fourth quarter of over the same period in our gross margins continued to suffer from the rapid declines we have been suffering in asps and were below historic levels at  margins from chip products were for the quarter 
in addition  our financial results were greatly impacted by a million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
which had a negative impact on our fully diluted loss per share of for the quarter 
the discussion in this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant 
table of contents accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition inventories and inventory reserves goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of long lived assets income taxes legal contingencies in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also cases in which management s judgment is required in selecting appropriate accounting treatment among available alternatives under gaap 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition except for sales to distributors  revenue from product sales are recognized at the time of shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for products sold to certain distributors with certain rights of return and adjustments  revenue is deferred until the distributor resells the products to a third party 
we provide for rebates based on current contractual terms and future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized as reductions to product revenue 
actual amounts may be different from management s estimates 
such differences  if any  are recorded in the period they become known 
income from mediatek royalties for the sale of products utilizing licensed technology is reported as revenue based on the number of units sold as reported to us by mediatek 
inventories and inventory reserves our inventory is comprised of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  all of which are manufactured by third party contractors 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated slow moving  excess  obsolete  damaged or otherwise unmarketable products by an amount that is the difference between cost and estimated market value based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
we evaluate excess or obsolete inventory primarily by estimating demand for individual products within specific time horizons  typically one year or less 
we generally provide a reserve for the cost of products with on hand and committed quantities in excess of the estimated demand after considering factors such as product life cycles 
once established  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory are only released when the reserved products are scrapped or sold 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory at the lower of standard cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are based on the difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is the forecasted selling price of the product less the estimated costs of completion and disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
the estimates of future demand  forecasted sales prices and market conditions used in the valuation of inventory form the basis for our published and internal revenue forecast 
if actual results are substantially 
table of contents lower than the forecast  we may be required to record additional write downs of product inventory in future periods and this may have a negative impact on gross margins 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
the impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
if we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
us deferred income taxes are not provided on un remitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered permanently invested 
assumptions underlying recognition of deferred tax assets and non recognition of us income tax on un remitted earnings can change if our business plan is not achieved or if congress adopts changes in the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
legal contingencies from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising out of the ordinary course of business 
further  we are currently engaged in certain shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 

table of contents these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no

 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on april   the securities and exchange commission sec revised the effective date of sfas no 
r and the new standard is effective for our quarter ending march  on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which expresses the view of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with non employees  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  capitalization of compensation costs related to shares based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas no

in october  the fasb issued fsp fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fas r fsp r 
fsp r provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas no 
r 
in accordance with this standard a grant date of an award exists if a the award is a unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
we will adopt this fsp when we adopt sfas no 
r 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the accumulated paid in capital pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are in the process of assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
r  including the transition method and option pricing model to select 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs which adopts wording from the international accounting standards board s ias inventories in an effort to improve the comparability of international financial reporting 
the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and statement no 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in 
table of contents accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments

to date  we have not declared or paid cash dividends to our shareholders and do not anticipate paying any dividend in the foreseeable future due to a number of factors  including the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential requirement to finance working capital in the event of a significant upturn in business 
we reevaluate this practice from time to time but are not currently contemplating the payment of a cash dividend 
we have no long term debt 
our capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be approximately million 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary business or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies

also  from time to time the board of directors may approve the expenditure of cash resources to repurchase our common stock as market conditions warrant 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and short term investments as of december   together with funds expected to be generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  strategic investment requirements  acquisitions of property and equipment  stock repurchases and other potential needs for the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes which may lead to changes in the market values of our investments 
foreign exchange risks we fund our operations with cash generated by operations  the sale of marketable securities and short and long term debt 
since most of our revenues are international  as we operate primarily in asia  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  our product sales and all of our arrangements with our foundries and test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong and korea 
expenses of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency and therefore are subject to foreign currency exchange risk  however  through december  we have not experienced any negative impact on our operations as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the foreign subsidiaries and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
interest rate risks we also invest in short term investments 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuation in interest rates on these investments 
increases or decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these investments 
for instance  one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in our interest income 
in addition  the credit worthiness of the issuer  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  and other general market conditions may affect the fair values of interest rate sensitive investments 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in rates  we invest in highly liquid governmental notes and bonds with contractual maturities of less than two years 
all of the investments have been classified as available for sale  and on december   the fair market value of our investments approximated their costs 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments in public companies 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and we have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments  primarily in technology companies  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
our objective in managing our exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to our earnings and cash flows 
there are  however  a number of factors beyond our control 
continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
we are also exposed to changes in the value of our investments in non public companies  including start up companies 
these long term equity investments in technology companies are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the industries in which these companies participate and other factors
