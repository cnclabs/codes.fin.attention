government contracts segment our government contracts segment includes our tricare contract for the north region and other health care related government contracts that we administer for the us department of defense the department of defense and the us department of veterans affairs 
certain components of these contracts are subcontracted to unrelated third parties 
approximately of our revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs such as tricare and our medicaid and medicare programs which are included as part of our health plan services segment 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
contracts under these programs are generally subject to frequent change  including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability to us under tricare and other federal government contracts 
in general  government receivables are estimates and are subject to government audit and negotiation

risk factors a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents tricare our wholly owned subsidiary  health net federal services  llc hnfs  administers a large managed care federal contract with the department of defense under the tricare program in the north region 
we have been serving the department of defense since under the tricare program and its predecessor programs 
we believe we have established a solid history of operating performance under our contracts with the department of defense 
we believe there will be further opportunities to serve the department of defense and other governmental organizations in the future 
our tricare contract for the north region is one of three regional contracts awarded by the department of defense in august under the tricare program 
the north region contract is a five year contract and covers connecticut  delaware  illinois  indiana  kentucky  maine  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  rhode island  vermont  virginia  west virginia  wisconsin and the district of columbia

eligible beneficiaries in the tricare program are able to choose from a variety of program options 
they can choose to enroll in tricare prime  which is similar to a conventional hmo plan  or they can select  on a case by case basis  to utilize tricare extra  which is similar to a conventional ppo plan  or tricare standard  which is similar to a conventional indemnity plan 
under tricare prime  enrollees pay an enrollment fee which is zero for active duty participants and their dependents and select a primary care physician from a designated provider panel 
the primary care physicians are responsible for making referrals to specialists and hospitals 
except for active duty family members  who have no co payment charges  tricare prime enrollees pay co payments each time they receive medical services from a civilian provider 
tricare prime enrollees may opt  on a case by case basis  for a point of service option in which they are allowed to self refer but incur a deductible and a co payment

table of contents other department of defense contracts during  hnfs managed three behavioral health services subcontracts  which support prime contracts issued by the department of defense s quality of life office 
under these subcontracts  hnfs and mhn have teamed together to provide family counseling and domestic abuse victim advocacy and hurricane katrina counseling to members of the us military and their families at certain department of defense locations in the united states  germany and italy 
the services provided under these subcontracts are not tricare benefits and are provided independently from the services provided under our tricare contract for the north region 
total revenue for these subcontracts for the year ended december  was million 
since january   the behavioral health services subcontracts have been managed principally by an affiliate of mhn 
veterans affairs during  hnfs administered contracts with the us department of veterans affairs to manage community based outpatient clinics in states 
hnfs also managed other contracts with the us department of veterans affairs in locations and one contract with the us marshals service for claims re pricing services 
total revenues for our veterans affairs business were approximately million for the year ended december   representing a increase over these revenues are derived from service fees received and have no insurance risk associated with them 
provider relationships and responsibilities we maintain a network of qualified physicians  hospitals and other health care providers in each of the states in which we offer managed care products and services 
physician relationships the following table sets forth the number of primary care and specialist physicians contracted either directly with our hmos or through our contracted participating physician groups ppgs as of december  primary care physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians specialist physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians total under most of our california hmo plans and pos plans  and under some of our hmo and pos plans outside california  members are required to select a ppg and a primary care physician from within that group 
in our other plans  including most of our plans outside of california  members may be required to select a primary care physician from the broader hmo network panel of primary care physicians 
some hmo open access plans and ppo plans do not require the member to select a primary care physician 
the primary care physicians and ppgs assume overall responsibility for the care of members 
medical care provided directly by such physicians includes the treatment of illnesses not requiring referral  and may include physical examinations  routine immunizations  maternity and childcare  and other preventive health services 
the primary care physicians and ppgs are responsible for making referrals approved by the hmo s or ppg s medical director as required under the terms of our various plans to specialists and hospitals 
certain of our hmos offer enrollees open panels under which members may access any physician in the network  or network physicians in certain specialties  without first consulting their primary care physician 
ppg and physician contracts are generally for a period of at least one year and are automatically renewable unless terminated  with certain requirements for maintenance of good professional standing and compliance with our quality  utilization and administrative procedures 
in california  ppgs generally receive a monthly capitation fee for every member assigned to it 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of 
table of contents member utilization of professional services 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
in these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated fee schedules with specialists 
outside of california  most of our hmos reimburse physicians according to a discounted fee for service schedule  although several have capitation arrangements with certain providers and provider groups in their market areas 
our connecticut hmo has a contract with the connecticut state medical society ipa csms 
in  we converted our contract with csms from a capitated risk arrangement coupled with a reinsurance agreement between csms and health net services bermuda  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  to a fee for service arrangement with gain share and pay for performance features 
as a result  we eliminated the reinsurance arrangement and all administration  referral authorization and claims administration is now performed by our connecticut health plan and physicians are paid on a fee for service basis 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
for services provided under our ppo products and the out of network benefits of our pos products  we ordinarily reimburse physicians pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements 
hospital relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas 
these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
covered inpatient hospital care for our hmo members is comprehensive 
it includes the services of hospital based physicians  nurses and other hospital personnel  room and board  intensive care  laboratory and x ray services  diagnostic imaging and generally all other services normally provided by acute care hospitals 
hmo or ppg nurses and medical directors are actively involved in discharge planning and case management  which often involves the coordination of community support services  including visiting nurses  physical therapy  durable medical equipment and home intravenous therapy 
in late  we began to see a pronounced increase in the number of high dollar  stop loss inpatient claims we were receiving from hospitals 
as stop loss claims rose  the percentage of payments made to hospitals for stop loss claims grew as well  in some cases in excess of 
this increase was caused by some hospitals aggressively raising chargemasters and billing for items separately when we believed they should have been included in the base charge 
management at our california health plan at that time responded to this trend by instituting a number of practices designed to reduce the cost of these claims  including  but not limited to  line item review of itemized billing statements and review of  and adjustment to  the level of prices charged on stop loss claims 
by early we began to see evidence that our claims review practices were causing significant friction with hospitals although  at that time  there was a relatively limited number of outstanding arbitration and litigation proceedings 
we responded by attempting to negotiate changes to the terms of our hospital contracts  in many cases to incorporate fixed reimbursement payment methodologies intended to reduce our exposure to the stop loss claims 
as we reached the third quarter of  an increase in arbitration requests and other litigation prompted us to review our approach to our claims review process for stop loss claims and our strategy relating to provider disputes 
given that our provider network is a key strategic asset  and following a thorough review of all 
table of contents outstanding provider disputes in our health plans  management decided in the fourth quarter of to enter into negotiations in an attempt to settle a large number of provider disputes in our california and northeast health plans 
the majority of these disputes related to alleged underpayment of stop loss claims 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax charge of million for expenses associated with provider settlements that had been or are currently in the process of being resolved  principally involving the alleged underpayment of stop loss claims 
included in this pretax charge is million related to the health care portion of the provider settlements and million related to legal costs 
in we paid million in provider settlements and related legal costs 
the remaining provider disputes liability balance relating to the pretax charge was million as of december  ancillary and other provider relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for ancillary and other provider services  such as ambulance  laboratory  radiology and home health  primarily through contracts with selected providers in their service areas 
these contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
in certain cases  these provider services are included in contracts our health plan subsidiaries have with ppgs and hospitals 
additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  legislative reform and market pressures brought about by a better informed and better organized customer base 
our hmos face substantial competition from for profit and nonprofit hmos  ppos  self funded plans including self insured employers and union trust funds  blue cross blue shield plans  and traditional indemnity insurance carriers  some of which have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
the development and growth of companies offering internet based connections between health care professionals  employers and members  along with a variety of services  could also create additional competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to user demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  and market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors vary by market 
over the past several years  a health plan s ability to interact with employers  members and other third parties including health care professionals via the internet has become a more important competitive factor 
to that end  we have made technology investments to enhance our electronic interactions with third parties 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants 
our primary competitors in california are kaiser permanente  blue cross of california  united pacificare and blue shield of california 
kaiser is the largest hmo in california based on number of enrollees and blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california based on number of enrollees 
together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
there are also a number of small  regional based health plans that compete with health net in california  mainly in the small business group market segment 
in addition  two of the major national managed care companies  aetna  inc and cigna corp  are active in california 
their respective commercial full risk market share is not as significant as our primary competitors in california and we believe that each remains in california primarily to serve their national  self funded accounts california employees 
our largest competitor in arizona is blue cross blue shield 
our arizona hmo also competes with unitedhealth group inc  cigna  pacificare health systems  inc  aetna and humana inc 
our oregon health plan competes primarily against kaiser  pacificare of oregon  providence  regence blue cross blue shield pacific source and lifewise

for certain large employer groups we also use our internal sales staff 
we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
for our small group business  members are enrolled by their employer based on the plan chosen by the employer 
in general  once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of techniques to attract new enrollees  including  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 
premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecasted by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable regulations that in certain circumstances prohibit experience rating of group accounts ie  setting the premium for the group based on its past use of health care services and by state regulations governing the manner in which premiums are structured 
we believe that the importance of the ultimate health care consumer or member in the health care product purchasing process is likely to increase in the future  particularly in light of advances in technology and online resources 
accordingly  we intend to focus our marketing strategies on the development of distinct brand identities and innovative product service offerings that will appeal to potential health plan members 
for example  in  we introduced decision power sm  which is a series of programs designed to more directly involve patients in their health care decisions 
these programs allow our members to access information and consult with health coaches as they are making decisions regarding health care issues 
we believe that decision power sm could be a meaningful competitive differentiator for our health plans in the future 
health net one systems consolidation project we are in the process of converting a number of information systems in our health plan business to a single system environment 
at the completion of the project  we expect to consolidate various systems into one general ledger system  one core claims system  one data warehouse system and one core web system 
in addition  we expect to reduce our number of surround information systems from to and consolidate our data centers to a single site with a tested backup facility 
key actions completed on the health net one systems consolidation project to date include consolidation to a single general ledger  consolidation of health plan portals  consolidation of data centers to a single site with backup facilities  consolidation of surround information systems and conversion of arizona s core claims system 
in late  we converted to a common eligibility database and in we converted to a common provider database 
in order to increase our focus on market demands  revenue generation and cost containment initiatives and to ensure the continued stabilization of claim payment patterns  we have changed the sequence of the health net one initiatives  placing the medical management initiatives and 
table of contents developing market capabilities ahead of the claim components of health net one 
the new medical management system was implemented in the northeast and arizona health plans for case management functionality in as a result  the conversion of the california and oregon provider and pricing  customer service  medical management and data warehouse systems was rescheduled for additionally  the claims functionality to support the conversion of the california and oregon claims processing is scheduled to be completed in with the conversion of new business to the health net one system in and the conversion of existing business in we believe that completion of the health net one systems consolidation project will improve customer client service and communication  enhance our national product capabilities  realize operational and cost efficiencies and improve our decision making capability 
in addition  we believe that completion of the project will enable us to improve our claims turnaround time  auto adjudication rates  electronic data interchange and internet capabilities 
however  there are risks associated with the health net one systems consolidation project 
see item a 
risk factors any failure to effectively maintain our management information systems could adversely affect our business 
consumer directed health care plans  health savings accounts health savings accounts hsas were created in as part of the mma 
hsas are individually owned accounts  similar to an ira or a k retirement plan  that generally allow employees to make contributions to the account on a pretax basis 
funds in hsas can be used to pay for certain qualified medical expenses such as plan deductibles  copayments and coinsurance on a tax free basis 
hsa funds can be invested and earnings on the investments are generally tax free 
hsas must be used in conjunction with high deductible health plans 
high deductible health plans provide in and out of network benefits and cover a wide range of health care services 
during  our northeast and arizona health plans launched hsa programs 
our hsa programs and other consumer driven health care products provide our members with tools to determine what health care services they may need and to estimate how much those services would cost 
we support our hsa programs with a web based program that assists members in educating themselves about health care 
the web based program includes decision power and prescription drug and hospital comparison tools 
in  we expect to further enhance our consumer driven health care initiative by offering the hsa program in california and oregon and expect to launch the health net health reimbursement account  commonly referred to as an hra 
see item a 
risk factors our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities provided by consumer directed healthcare  such as our hsa program  could prove to be unsuccessful 
medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in cases where reimbursement is based on risk sharing arrangements 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practice in the medical profession 
in  we saw steady improvement in our initiatives  especially in the northeast and california 
our strengthened medical management practices helped lower commercial health care cost trends 
for example  our more focused inpatient review processes caused commercial hospital bed days per thousand commercial enrollees to drop from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of we believe that the reduced number of commercial bed days reflect our more effective use of population based data analysis and increasingly refined identification of members with conditions whose care we can improve by providing them with education and support 
we are investing in enterprise wide analytic capabilities to more precisely deploy the appropriate resources to members who can benefit from our services 

table of contents in early  we began an enterprise wide initiative to restructure our network management and medical management resources 
by changing the way these parts of our organization work together  we are elevating our commitment to health care management as a primary component of our value proposition 
this will also include more formal organization of network and medical resources across markets to bring better programs to each market 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa and urac are independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos 
hmos that comply with review requirements and quality standards receive accreditation 
our california and arizona hmo subsidiaries have received ncqa accreditation and mhn has received urac accreditation 
our connecticut  new jersey and new york subsidiaries are scheduled for ncqa accreditation surveys in the second quarter of quality assessment quality assessment is a continuing priority for us 
all of our health plans have a quality assessment plan administered by a committee composed of medical directors and primary care and specialist physicians 
the committees responsibilities include periodic review of medical records  development and implementation of standards of care based on current medical literature and community standards  and the collection of data relating to results of treatment 
all of our health plans also have a subscriber grievance procedure and or a member satisfaction program designed to respond promptly to member grievances 
elements of these subscriber grievance procedures and member satisfaction programs are incorporated both within the ppgs and within our health plans 
government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all current state and federal laws and regulations applicable to our business 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
federal legislation and regulation medicare legislation 
on december   the mma was signed into law 
this complex legislation made many significant structural changes to the federal medicare program and added a voluntary prescription drug benefit  called a part d benefit  that was made available to medicare beneficiaries starting january  the mma changed the methodology for payment to private plans to a competitive bidding process beginning in the first bids were submitted in june for the medicare advantage plans  the bidding process compared each plan s bid  which was based on historical health care costs  to a benchmark cost figure developed by cms 
the projected savings from the benchmark rate will be used to fund additional benefits 
the remaining will be retained by cms 
the mma also authorized regional ppos to serve regions  and incorporated other features designed to provide a private market option on a broader scale across the united states 
in  we restructured our medicare program management team in order to build infrastructure to capitalize on opportunities presented by the mma 
the restructured medicare program management team has been designed to increase our capability for effective execution on growth and cost management initiatives in response to opportunities presented by the mma and the medicare program generally 
we spent approximately million in supporting our medicare expansion efforts 

table of contents privacy regulations 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection therewith impose obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors relating to the privacy and security of transmitted protected health information phi 
the regulations  consisting of privacy regulations  transactions and codeset requirements and security regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  create policies related to the privacy of phi and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
we are in compliance with the hipaa privacy regulations  the requirements relating to transactions and codesets and the security regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
federal hmo act 
under the federal health maintenance organization act of the hmo act  services to members must be provided substantially on a fixed  prepaid basis without regard to the actual degree of utilization of services 
premiums established by an hmo may vary from account to account through composite rate factors and special treatment of certain broad classes of members  and through prospective but not retrospective rating adjustments 
several of our hmos are federally qualified in certain parts of their respective service areas under the hmo act and are therefore subject to the requirements of such act to the extent federally qualified products are offered and sold 
erisa 
most employee benefit plans are regulated by the federal government under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment based health coverage is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered  in large part  by the us department of labor dol 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define the benefits and coverage 
it also contains a provision that causes federal law to preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
miscellaneous 
our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms 
cms has the right to audit hmos and ppos operating under medicare contracts to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 
our medicaid business is also subject to regulation by cms  as well as state agencies  and is generally examined on a periodic basis by such state agencies 
california laws and regulations california hmo regulations 
california hmos  such as hn california and our behavioral health plan  mhn  are subject to california state regulation  principally by the department of managed health care dmhc under the knox keene act 
among the areas regulated by the knox keene act are adequacy of administrative operations  
table of contents the scope of benefits required to be made available to members  procedures for review of quality assurance  enrollment requirements  procedures for resolving grievances  adequacy and accessibility of the network of health care providers  timely and accurate payment of provider claims  initial and continuing financial viability of the hmo and its risk bearing providers  provision of services that are culturally and linguistically accessible  and composition of policy making bodies to assure that plan members have access to representation 
on september   assembly bill ab was signed into law 
ab amended and added several sections to the knox keene act 
as required by ab  the dmhc adopted final regulations the ab regulations addressing both claims reimbursement and provider dispute resolution procedures 
the ab regulations include new and substantial requirements concerning provider claims handling  such as limitations on the health plans ability to limit the time of submission of claims by providers  standards for payment of providers who are not contracted with the plan  recovery of overpayment notifications to providers regarding the payment or denial of their claims  disclosure requirements as to fee schedules and payment policies  and limitations on payment policy changes 
the ab regulations also include detailed rules concerning provider appeal rights and the plans responsibilities in providing a fast and fair dispute resolution mechanism  including restrictions on the plans timely submission requirements  time period for resolution of an appeal and for the written explanation of the plans determinations  and an annual regulatory reporting requirement by plans 
the ab regulations also apply to the health plans provider groups to which the plans have delegated claims payment and provider appeal functions  and the plans are required to have in place certain oversight mechanisms to assure compliance by their delegated provider groups 
in january  the dmhc released a written draft for an month pilot program to provide independent arbitration of plan provider disputes to be effective in october no assurance can be given as to whether this proposal will be implemented in in this or any other form 
any material modifications to the organization or operations of hn california and mhn are subject to prior review and approval by the dmhc 
this approval process can be lengthy and there is no certainty of approval 
other significant changes require filing with the dmhc  which may then comment and require changes 
in addition  under the knox keene act  hn california and mhn must file periodic reports with  and are subject to periodic review and investigation by  the dmhc 
non compliance with the knox keene act  including the provisions added and amended by ab  may result in an enforcement action  fines and penalties  and  in the most severe cases  limitations on or revocation of the knox keene license 
other laws and regulations in each state in which our hmo and insurance subsidiaries collectively  regulated subsidiaries do business  our regulated subsidiaries must meet numerous state licensing criteria and secure the approval of state licensing authorities before implementing certain operational changes  including the development of new product offerings and  in some states  the expansion of service areas 
state departments of insurance dois regulate our insurance business under various provisions of state insurance codes and regulations 
to remain licensed  each regulated subsidiary must continue to comply with state laws and regulations and may from time to time be required to change services  procedures or other aspects of its operations to comply with changes in applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  regulated subsidiaries must file periodic reports with  and their operations are subject to periodic examination by  state licensing authorities 
our regulated subsidiaries are required by state law to meet certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements in each state and may be restricted 
table of contents from paying dividends to their parent corporations under some circumstances 
for additional information regarding our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital requirements see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
several states have increased minimum capital requirements  in response to proposals by the national association of insurance commissioners to institute risk based capital requirements 
regulations in these and other states may be changed in the future to further increase capital requirements 
such increases could require us to contribute additional capital to our regulated subsidiaries 
any adverse change in governmental regulation or in the regulatory climate in any state could materially impact the regulated subsidiaries operating in that state 
the hmo act and state laws place various restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to price their products freely 
we must comply with applicable provisions of state insurance and similar laws  including regulations governing our ability to seek ownership interests in new hmos  ppos and insurance companies  or otherwise expand our geographic markets or diversify our product lines 
pending federal and state legislation there are a number of other legislative initiatives and proposed regulations currently pending or previously proposed at the federal and state levels which could increase regulation of and costs incurred by the health care industry 
these measures and other initiatives  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations 
see item a 
risk factors proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulation 
intellectual property we have filed for registration of and maintain several service marks  trademarks and tradenames that we use in our businesses  including marks and names incorporating the health net phrase 
we utilize these and other marks and names in connection with the marketing and identification of products and services 
we believe such marks and names are valuable and material to our marketing efforts 
employees as of december   health net  inc and its subsidiaries employed  persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time or temporary basis 
these employees perform a variety of functions  including  among other things  provision of administrative services for employers  providers and members  negotiation of agreements with physician groups  hospitals  pharmacies and other health care providers  handling of claims for payment of hospital and other services  and provision of data processing services 
our employees are not unionized and we have not experienced any work stoppages since our inception 
we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 
recent and other developments and other company information acquisition of universal care health plan assets on january   we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain health plan assets of universal care  inc  a california based health care company 
this transaction is expected to close in the first half of  subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approval 
upon closing of this acquisition  we expect to add approximately  medi cal and healthy families beneficiaries to the approximately  medi cal and healthy families beneficiaries that we already serve in nine california counties 
further  we will have the opportunity to enroll an additional  medi cal and healthy families beneficiaries in orange county 
in addition  upon closing  we expect to add approximately  medicare advantage beneficiaries and approximately  commercial members that have received coverage through contracts with universal care s health plans

our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services or supplies to be delivered to our members 
the total health care costs we incur are affected by the number and type of individual services provided and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to control future health care utilization and costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups and numerous other factors affecting health care costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs as well as our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  a pandemic  such as the avian flu  could affect our ability to control health care costs 
see a pandemic  such as a worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus  could materially and adversely affect our ability to control health care costs 
for several years  one of the fastest increasing categories of our health care costs has been the cost of hospital based products and services 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition 
in  several of our health plans 
table of contents experienced higher than expected claims costs  especially for inpatient and outpatient hospital claims 
these higher than expected costs contributed to a decline in our net income in as realized premium yields were lower than cost trends 
another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
although pharmaceutical costs have not been increasing at the rate of hospital costs  evolving regulation may impact the ability of our hmos to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members 
other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs and changes in discounts 
the inability to forecast and manage our health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
our premium revenue is set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge  factors such as competition  regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased utilization of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  seasonality  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  and insured population characteristics 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
over the course of and  we instituted premium increases at the high end of the range of premium increases instituted by our competitors 
we lost members as a result of these premium increases and could lose additional members in the future 
maintaining premiums at the high end of the market also increases the risk that our health plans are affected by adverse risk selection 
adverse risk selection occurs when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans at the higher premium rates rather than risk moving to another plan 
this could cause health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 
our inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of future costs based on various assumptions 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicious administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services which have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates are continually monitored and reviewed and  as settlements are made or estimates adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ significantly from the amounts reserved 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  it could have a negative impact on our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period 
if our actual liability is lower than estimated  it could mean that we set premium prices too high  which could result in a loss of membership 
if we were to lose membership as a result of our premium prices being set too high  there can be no assurance that we would be able to regain that membership by reducing premiums 

table of contents we may experience losses as a result of the regional concentration of our business 
our business operations are concentrated in the northeast in the states of connecticut  new york and new jersey and in the states of california  arizona and oregon 
due to this concentration in a small number of states  we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results arising from a significant economic downturn in one or more of these states 
if economic conditions in these states significantly deteriorate  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if any one of our health plans experiences significant losses  our consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
for example  in early  our new jersey health plan experienced hospital cost trends significantly higher than the trends we estimated when we established premiums and potentially higher than those of its competitors 
these higher hospital cost trends caused a deterioration in margins in early which had an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations in enrollment in our new jersey health plan continued to decrease throughout in addition  in  we began to experience a small number of large group account losses in certain markets due to employer groups consolidating their business with a single  most often national  competitor 
we expect this trend to continue throughout  which could cause further account losses in the large group segment 
a deterioration in margins in any one of the states in which we operate  or a loss of large accounts to national competitors  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to offset the deterioration with adequate future premium increases 
our businesses are highly regulated 
our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  and or increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
in particular  our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  and approval of policy language and benefits 
although these regulations have not significantly impeded the growth of our businesses to date  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
our efforts to capitalize on medicare business opportunities could prove to be unsuccessful 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our total revenue in and an expected in in connection with the passage of the mma and the mma implementing regulations adopted in  we have significantly expanded our medicare health plans and restructured our medicare program management team to enhance our ability to pursue business opportunities presented by the mma and the medicare program generally 
the mma and related regulations provide for the prospect of increased medicare funding 
if the cost and complexity of the recent medicare changes exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayers of the mma or for other reasons  if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants  or if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma s competitive bidding process  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  and we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives 

table of contents federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have been and  in some cases  currently are  involved in various federal and state governmental audits  reviews and investigations 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and others 
such audits  reviews and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
many regulatory audits  reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers 
our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits  reviews and investigations of this nature 
depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed  regulatory findings could require remediation of claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  we are currently the subject of a regulatory investigation in new jersey that relates to the timeliness and accuracy of our claim payments for services rendered by out of network providers 
the new jersey department of banking and insurance new jersey dobi has commenced an audit of our claims payment practices for out of network claims 
depending on the outcome of the audit  the new jersey dobi could impose monetary fines or require remediation of out of network claims payment inaccuracies which could have significant adverse effects on our business 
similarly  hn california  our california hmo  is in discussions with the california department of managed health care dmhc regarding our prepayment line item review and repricing processes with respect to the claims of contracted hospitals for dates of services from and after january  those discussions are ongoing  but could result in an administrative penalty  extension of the appeal period for previously paid claims or other business practice modifications 
proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
there are frequently legislative proposals before the united states congress and state legislatures and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels which  if enacted  could materially affect the managed health care industry and the regulatory environment 
these proposals have included initiatives which  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations  including subjecting us to additional litigation risk  regulatory compliance costs and restrictions on our business operations 
such measures have proposed  among other things  to require plans participating in the mma s prescription drug benefit program to reimburse the states for costs expended to ensure that dual eligibles  or medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible for medicaid  receive prescriptions in a timely manner  restrict a health plan s ability to limit coverage to medically necessary care  restrict or eliminate health insurers and health plans in the marketplace  allow association health plans to create insurance like products that compete unfairly with health plans  require third party review of certain care decisions  require health plans to pay significantly higher taxes  increase minimum capital or risk based capital requirements  expedite or modify grievance and appeals procedures  restrict the ability of health plans to share or shift the cost of health care services to providers or members  
table of contents reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for services provided under government programs such as medicare and medicaid  enhance providers payment rights and access to appeal processes  segment existing markets which could create an unsuitable regulatory environment for us  mandate certain benefits and services  including mental health parity  that could increase our costs  add further restrictions and administrative and disclosure requirements related to compensatory arrangements pertaining to agents and brokers in connection with the sale of products  restrict a health plan s ability to select and or terminate providers  restrict a health plan s ability to establish formulary terms and conditions for covered pharmaceuticals  regulate health care premiums  and require participation in a dispute resolution process to determine what providers should be paid 
we cannot predict the outcome of any such legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulations 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
approximately of our revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  such as medicare  medicaid and tricare 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels or increases them by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely affected 
contracts under these programs are generally subject to frequent change  including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
changes of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes to government health care coverage programs in the future may also affect our willingness to participate in these programs 
the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability to us under tricare and other federal government contracts 
in general  government receivables are estimates and subject to government audit and negotiation 
in addition  inherent in government contracts are an uncertainty of and vulnerability to disagreements with the government 
final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
currently  many states are experiencing budget deficits  and some states  including california  have reduced or have begun to reduce  or have proposed reductions in  payments to medicaid managed care providers 
any significant reduction in payments received in connection with medicaid could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or 
table of contents take other actions which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
some of these providers may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
we contract with professional providers in california primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
we also use capitation fee arrangements in areas other than california  but to a lesser extent 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with specialists and other secondary providers  and may contract with primary care physicians  to provide services 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in california  the liability of our hmo subsidiaries for unpaid provider claims has not been definitively settled 
there can be no assurance that we will not be liable for unpaid provider claims 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members and insureds are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider 
in some states and product lines  the amount of compensation is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translated into dollar terms 
in such instances providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
we may then have an obligation to protect our members against financial harm  either by paying the provider the additional amount demanded or by reimbursing the member for his her out of pocket payment 
the uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of the payment could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
provider groups and hospitals have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that results from them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pretax charge related to expenses associated with settlements involving provider disputes that have been  or are currently in the process of being  resolved 
for additional information regarding provider disputes  see item legal proceedings provider disputes 

table of contents we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to accurately project litigation expenses 
we are subject to a variety of legal actions to which any corporation may be subject  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  fraud and misrepresentation claims  shareholder suits  including suits for securities fraud  and intellectual property and real estate related disputes 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims particularly related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular  such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  improper rescission  termination or non renewal of coverage  claims by employer groups for return of premiums and claims by providers  including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement  claims related to self funded business  and claims related to reinsurance matters 
such actions can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages 
for example in mccoy v 
health net  inc et al  and wachtel v 
guardian life insurance co  the plaintiffs allege that the manner in which our various subsidiaries paid member claims for out of network services was improper 
plaintiffs have sought potentially severe sanctions against us for a variety of alleged misconduct  discovery abuses and fraud on the court 
the sanctions sought by plaintiffs and being considered by the court include  among others  entry of a default judgment  monetary sanctions  and either the appointment of a monitor to oversee our claims payment practices and our dealings with state regulators or the appointment of an independent fiduciary to replace the company as a fiduciary with respect to our claims adjudications for members 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are also being sought 
see item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding mccoy and our other legal proceedings 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we are incurring material expenses in the defense of litigation matters including without limitation substantial discovery costs 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation  other such liabilities such as punitive damages or the cost of implementing changes in our operations required by the resolution of a claim  may not be covered by insurance  the insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance could not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level which would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy 
in addition  recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face 
there is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions we defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense 
in certain cases  we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs counsel 
although we have established reserves for litigation costs  we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves are adequate to cover such costs 
therefore  the litigation to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and could prompt us to change our operating procedures 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 

table of contents any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
for example  during  we experienced higher than expected government contracts revenue and health care costs due to consequences of overseas military activity 
in prior years  commercial and medicare health care costs have been higher than anticipated  causing margins to narrow more than expected and causing a negative impact on our financial and operating results 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this annual report on form k  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will meet any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us  our services  and our industry when evaluating our forecasts and other forward looking statements relating to our operations and financial performance 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive and our inability to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we compete with a number of other entities in the geographic and product markets in which we operate  some of which may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources  such as greater market share  superior supplier arrangements and existing business relationships  that give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
we believe that increased funding provided by the mma will increase the number of competitors in senior health services and could affect our medicare advantage program 
in addition  financial services or other technology based companies could enter the market and compete with us on the basis of their streamlined administrative functions 
the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
there is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in recent years  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies are frequently up for re bid and the loss of any significant government contract to a competitor could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities provided by consumer directed healthcare  such as our hsa program  could prove to be unsuccessful 
according to corporate research group  hsas  hras and consumer directed healthcare are expected to comprise to of the healthcare market by the year in terms of enrollment 
america s health insurance plans ahip reported that  as of june  the number of individual and group members choosing hsa compatible high deductible health plans was approximately million  more than double the  that had signed up as of september ahip also reported that most of the recent growth has come from groups offering hsa compatible plans to their employees 
as of december   nearly every major managed care organization has launched  announced or is developing hsa compatible high deductible health plans 
as of december   we had launched hsa 
table of contents programs in our northeast and arizona health plans 
our hsa programs represented a very small percentage of our total revenue in  primarily as a consequence of limited demand for such products in these two markets 
among our commercial customers in california  we do not currently see meaningful demand for consumer directed products 
some of our large competitors  such as aetna and blue cross blue shield plans  have made large investments in  and heavily marketed  their consumer directed health plans and in gained more enrollment in many markets across the country 
if their enrollment trend continues  it may widen the competitive gap between us over the next several years 
if we fail to design  maintain and effectively market consumer directed health care programs that are attractive to consumers and  as a result  are unable to achieve a competitive market share in the consumer directed care category  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million in unsecured senior notes 
in addition  to provide liquidity  we have a million five year revolving senior credit facility that expires in june as of december   no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
if we were to draw on our senior credit facility  or incur other additional debt in the future  it could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
in an effort to lower our interest expense  we are currently considering our financing alternatives  including refinancing or repurchasing our senior notes 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our senior notes and obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
we are a holding company and a substantial amount of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to hmo and insurance regulations that require them to meet or exceed various capital standards and may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make cash transfers to us 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and health net  inc s cash flow 
for additional information regarding our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital requirements  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 

table of contents our senior credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our senior credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth requirement 
on september   moody s investor services moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from baa to ba and on november   standard poor s rating service s p downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bb 
because the moody s rating on our senior unsecured debt is below baa and the s p rating is below bbb  we are currently prohibited under the terms of our senior credit facility from making dividends  distributions or redemptions in respect of our capital stock in excess of million in any consecutive four quarter period  are subject to a minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio rather than a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  are subject to additional reporting requirements to the lenders  and are subject to increased interest and fees applicable to any outstanding borrowings and any letters of credit secured under the credit facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our senior credit facility 
if we do not comply with the restrictive covenants under our senior credit facility  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
any failure to effectively maintain our management information systems could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems 
we are in the process of consolidating a significant number of our core and surround systems as part of our health net one systems consolidation project 
see item business additional information concerning our business health net one systems consolidation project for information regarding this consolidation project 
we believe that by consolidating our systems into one common nationwide set  we will gain operational and cost efficiencies 
any difficulty or delay associated with the transition to or from information systems  any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
in addition  we may  from time to time  obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
we must comply with emerging restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates with hipaa in december  the department of health and human services promulgated regulations under hipaa related to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted phi 
the regulations require health plans  
table of contents clearinghouses and providers to a comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  b adopt rigorous internal procedures to safeguard phi and c enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
in addition  the regulations could expose us to additional liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates 
although we provide for appropriate protections in our contracts with our business associates  we have limited control over their actions and practices 
compliance with hipaa and other state and federal privacy regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services 
managed health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
the managed health care industry has also recently experienced significant merger and acquisition activity  giving rise to speculation and uncertainty regarding the status of companies in our industry 
our marketing efforts may be affected by the amount of negative publicity to which the managed health care industry has been subject  as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry 
speculation  uncertainty or negative publicity about us  our industry or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services  require changes to our products or services  or stimulate additional legislation  regulation  review of industry practices or private litigation that could adversely affect us 
if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
the level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability  and administrative expense increases are difficult to predict 
while we attempt to effectively manage such expenses  including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies such as the health net one systems consolidation project  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time due to business or product start ups or expansions such as medicare advantage  growth  membership declines or changes in business  difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  acquisitions  reliance on outsourced services  regulatory requirements  including compliance with hipaa regulations  or other reasons 
for example  in we spent approximately million in general and administrative expenses on medicare related opportunities 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase throughout as a result of our focus on investing in growth and for our ongoing investment in medicare 
if our growth opportunities or the benefits we expect from our medicare investment are not realized  we could be required to cut costs 
cost reductions could include  among other things  an involuntary workforce reduction or further delays in our health net one systems consolidation project 
changes in the value of our investment assets could have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
substantially all of our investment assets are in interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities or equity securities 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
in addition  our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries portfolios 
there can be no assurance that our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations or otherwise  could have a negative affect on our stockholders equity 
in addition  if it became 
table of contents necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend  in part  on independent brokers and sales agents to market our products and services  and recent regulatory investigations have focused on certain brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices 
we market our products and services both through sales people employed by us and through independent sales agents 
independent sales agents typically do not work with us on an exclusive basis and may market health care products and services of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent sales agents and we cannot assure you that these agents will continue to market our products at a reasonable cost 
although we have a number of sales employees and agents  if key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals were to leave us  our ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
there have been a number of investigations and enforcement actions against insurance brokers and insurers over the last several years regarding allegedly inappropriate or undisclosed payments made by insurers to brokers for the placement of insurance business 
while we are not aware of any unlawful practices by the company or any of our agents or brokers in connection with the marketing and sales of our products and services  current investigations by the new york attorney general and other regulators as well as regulatory changes initiated in several states in response to allegedly inappropriate payment practices could result in changes in industry practices that could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to volatility 
in  the hmo index  an index comprised of managed care organizations  including health net  recorded an approximate rise in its value  while the per share value of our common stock increased by approximately 
there can be no assurance that the value of our common stock will continue to increase at this pace or at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will vary in a manner consistent with the variation in the hmo index or the standard poors mid cap index of which our common stock is also a component 
the market prices of our common stock and the securities of certain other publicly traded companies in our industry have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including public communications regarding managed care  legislative or regulatory actions  litigation or threatened litigation  health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earnings or membership reports of particular industry participants  and market speculation about or actual acquisition activity 
additionally  adverse developments affecting any one of the leading companies in our sector could cause the price of our common stock to weaken  even if those adverse developments do not otherwise affect us 
there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price 
natural disasters  including earthquakes  fires and floods  could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
natural disasters such as fire  flood  earthquake  tornado  power loss  virus  telecommunications failure  break in or similar event could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations  result in loss of data  and or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers 
we have in place a disaster recovery plan which is intended to provide us with the ability to maintain fully redundant systems for our operations in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor 
however  there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents terrorist and other malicious activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs 
the september  terrorist attacks  the war on terrorism and the threat of future acts of terrorism  including bio terrorism  have negatively affected  and could continue to negatively affect  the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
we have updated our procedures for dealing with potential terrorist related activity such as the september  attacks  the anthrax cases in and potential future events involving malicious activity 
even with such updated procedures  there can be no assurance that future acts of terrorism or other malicious activity will not occur or that such events will not materially or negatively affect us 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased use of health care services  disruption of information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk such as acts of terrorism and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general 
a pandemic  such as a worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus  could materially and adversely affect our ability to control health care costs 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease  such as the avian influenza a virus  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
although we cannot predict if and when a pandemic will occur  or accurately forecast how many people will be affected by a pandemic  the us department of health and human services the dhhs and other government agencies have cautioned that the impact of a pandemic on the united states could be substantial 
dhhs has cited studies suggesting that  in the absence of any control measures  such as a vaccination  a medium level pandemic in the united states could cause  to  deaths   to  hospitalizations  million to million outpatient visits and another million to million people being sick 
while  to date  the avian flu has struck mostly the poultry population in southeast asia and parts of europe and africa  it has affected humans in a small number of cases 
upon mutation to a form that can be transmitted from human to human  the avian flu virus has the potential to spread rapidly worldwide 
estimates of the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated avian flu virus that can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative 
we continue to monitor developing facts 
a significant global outbreak of avian flu among humans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increased inpatient and outpatient hospital costs and the cost of anti viral medication to treat the virus

these two lawsuits are styled as class actions and were filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of a class of subscribers in a number of our large and small employer group plans in the northeast 
the wachtel complaint was filed on july  and the mccoy complaint was filed on april  these two cases have been consolidated for purposes of trial 
plaintiffs allege that health net  inc  health net of the northeast  inc and health net of new jersey  inc 
violated erisa in connection with various practices related to the reimbursement of claims for services provided by out of network providers 
plaintiffs seek relief in the form of payment of benefits  disgorgement  injunctive and other equitable relief  and attorneys fees 
during and  the parties filed and argued various motions and engaged in limited discovery

on january   counsel for the plaintiffs in the mccoy wachtel actions filed a separate class action against health net  inc  health net of the northeast  inc  health net of new york  inc  health net life insurance co  and health net of california  inc captioned scharfman v 
health net  inc  cv fsh ps united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of the same parties who would have been added to the mccoy wachtel action as additional class representatives had the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend their complaint in that action 
this new action contains similar allegations to those made by the plaintiffs in the mccoy wachtel action 

table of contents discovery has concluded and a final pre trial order was submitted to the district court in mccoy wachtel on june  both sides have moved for summary judgment  and briefing on those motions has been completed 
in their summary judgment briefing  plaintiffs also sought appointment of a monitor to act as an independent fiduciary to oversee the administration of our northeast health plans including claims payment practices 
we have opposed the appointment of a monitor 
notwithstanding our pending third circuit appeal of the district court s class certification order  a trial date was set for september  on july   we filed a motion in the district court to stay the district court action and the trial in light of the pending third circuit appeal 
on august   the district court denied our motion to stay and instead adjourned the september trial date and ordered that the parties be prepared to go to trial on seven days notice as of september  we immediately filed a request for a stay with the third circuit seeking an order directing the district court to refrain from holding any trial or entering any judgment or order that would have the effect of resolving any claims or issues affecting the disputed class until the third circuit rules on the class certification order 
plaintiffs cross moved for dismissal of the class certification appeal 
on september   the third circuit granted our motion for a stay and denied plaintiffs cross motion 
plaintiffs have not specified the amount of damages being sought in this litigation and  although these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  based on the proceedings to date  we believe the amount of damages ultimately asserted by plaintiffs could be material 
on august   plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court seeking sanctions against us for a variety of alleged acts of serious misconduct  discovery abuses and fraud on the district court 
the sanctions sought by plaintiffs and being considered by the court include  among others  entry of a default judgment  monetary sanctions  including a substantial award for plaintiffs legal fees  and either the appointment of a monitor to oversee our claims payment practices and our dealings with state regulators or the appointment of an independent fiduciary to replace the company as a fiduciary with respect to our claims adjudications for members 
on september   we responded to plaintiffs motion denying that any sanctionable misconduct  discovery abuses or fraud had occurred 
the district court held hearings on plaintiffs motion for sanctions october and   november   november   december and  and january  throughout the hearing process  the parties took additional depositions and submitted additional briefs on issues that arose during the hearings 
the hearings have recessed but not concluded 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this litigation 
these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these proceedings or the incurrence of substantial legal fees or discovery expenses during the pendency of the proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity

the knecht  solomon  ashton and freiberg cases all are brought on behalf of health care providers other than physicians and seek certification of a nationwide class of similarly situated health care providers 
other than shane  all provider track actions involving us have been stayed 
on may   we and the representatives of approximately  physicians and state and other medical societies announced that we had signed an agreement settling shane  the lead physician provider track action 
the settlement agreement requires us to pay million to general settlement funds and million for plaintiffs legal fees 
the deadline for class members to submit claim forms in order to receive a portion of the settlement funds was september  this deadline was extended by agreement to november  for class members who reside or practice in a county declared as a disaster area as a result of hurricane katrina 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in connection with the settlement agreement  legal expenses and other expenses related to the mdl litigation 
the settlement agreement also includes a commitment that we institute a number of business practice changes 
among the business practice changes we have agreed to implement are enhanced disclosure of certain claims payment practices  conforming claims editing software to certain editing and payment rules and standards  payment of electronically submitted claims in days days for paper claims  use of a uniform definition of medical necessity that includes reference to generally accepted standards of medical practice and credible scientific evidence published in peer reviewed medical literature  establish a billing dispute external review board to afford prompt  independent resolution of billing disputes  provide day notice of changes in practices and policies and implement various changes to standard form contracts  establish an independent physician advisory committee  and  where physicians are paid on a capitation basis  provide projected cost and utilization information  provide periodic reporting and not delay assignment to the capitated physician 
the settlement agreement requires us to implement these business practice changes by various dates  and to maintain them for a four year period thereafter

lawsuits relating to sale of businesses amcareco litigation we are a defendant in two related litigation matters pending in state courts in louisiana and texas  both of which relate to claims asserted by three receivers overseeing the liquidation of health plans in louisiana  texas and oklahoma that were previously owned by our former wholly owned subsidiary  foundation health corporation fhc 
in  fhc sold its interest in these plans to amcareco  inc amcareco 
in  three years after the sale of the three health plans  the plans were placed under applicable state oversight and ultimately placed into receivership later that year 
the receivers for each of the plans later filed suit against certain of amcareco s officers  directors and investors  amcareco s independent auditors and outside counsel  and us 
the plaintiffs contend that  among other things  we were responsible as a controlling shareholder of amcareco following the sale of the plans for post acquisition misconduct by amcareco and others that caused the three health plans ultimately to be placed into receiverships 
on june   a trial of the claims asserted against us by the three receivers commenced in state court in baton rouge  louisiana 
the claims of the receiver for the texas plan amcare tx were tried before a louisiana jury and the claims of the receiver for the louisiana plan amcare la and the receiver for the oklahoma plan amcare ok were simultaneously tried before the court 
on june   the jury considering the claims of amcare tx returned a million verdict against us  consisting of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the jury found us at fault for the compensatory damages based on the amcare tx receiver s claims of breach of fiduciary duty  fraud  unfair or deceptive acts or practices and conspiracy 
following the jury verdict  the amcare tx receiver asserted that  as an alternative to the award of punitive damages  the court could award up to three times the compensatory damages awarded to the amcare tx receiver 
we opposed that assertion 
on august   the court entered judgment on the jury s verdict in the amcare tx matter 
in its judgment  the court  among other things  reduced the compensatory damage award to million which is of the jury s million compensatory damage award and rejected the amcare tx receiver s demand for a trebling of the compensatory damages 
the judgment also included the award of million in punitive damages 
on august   after entry of judgment in the amcare tx claim  we filed post trial motions with the court asking that the judgment be vacated or  alternatively  reduced 
on august   the court heard the motions and granted us partial relief by reducing the compensatory damage award by an additional based upon the fault of other individuals involved in the proceeding and by reducing the punitive damage award by 
as a result of these reductions  the compensatory damages have been reduced to million  and the punitive damages have been reduced to million 
the court signed the judgment reflecting these reductions 
table of contents on november  we filed a motion for suspensive appeal and posted the required security within the delays allowed by law 
a briefing schedule will be issued once the record is lodged with the appellate court 
the proceedings regarding the claims of the amcare la receiver and the amcare ok receiver continued in the trial court until july   when written final arguments were submitted 
in their final written arguments  the amcare la and amcare ok receivers asked the court to award approximately million in compensatory damages against us and requested that the court award punitive or other non compensatory damages and attorneys fees 
on november   the court issued two judgments  one awarding amcare la compensatory damages  and a separate judgment awarding amcare ok compensatory damages 
both judgments allocated of the fault to us  and the remaining to other persons and companies 
the judgment in favor of amcare la found that despite the allocation of fault  we were contractually liable for of amcare la s compensatory damages 
the result is that the court awarded amcare la approximately million and amcare ok approximately million in compensatory damages 
we filed motions for suspensive appeal and posted security within the delays allowed by law 
on november   the court proceeded with the bifurcated trial on amcare la and amcare ok s claims for punitive damages  other non compensatory damages and attorneys fees 
the court signed a judgment on december   in which it denied amcare la s request for attorneys fees 
the court signed a judgment on december   in which it denied amcare ok s request for attorneys fees 
the court signed another judgment on december   in which it dismissed amcare la and amcare ok s claim for punitive damages 
on december   amcare la and amcare ok filed a notice of election of treble damages in which those plaintiffs  in light of the court s december judgment dismissing their claim for punitive damages  elected to receive treble damages pursuant to the texas insurance code and the texas civil practices and remedies code 
on the same day amcare ok filed a motion for a new trial on the court s denial of its request for attorneys fees 
we filed a motion to strike that election of treble damages and deny the claim for treble damages  and a motion for a new trial on the election of treble damages on january  on january   the court heard the motion for a new trial filed by amcare ok  and the motion to strike and the motion for a new trial that we filed 
the court denied amcare ok s motion for a new trial on the attorneys fees  and granted our motion to strike the election of treble damages 
the grant of our motion to strike rendered our motion for a new trial moot 
the effect of the court s january  ruling is that the december and december  judgments are now final for purposes of appeal 
amcare la and amcare ok have not yet appealed those judgments 
the amcare la action was originally filed against us on june  that original action sought only to enforce a parental guarantee that fhc had issued in which obligated it to contribute sufficient capital to the louisiana health plan to enable the plan to maintain statutory minimum capital requirements 
the original action also alleged that the parental guarantee was not terminated in connection with the sale of the louisiana plan 
the amcare tx and amcare ok actions were originally filed in texas state court  and we were made a party to that action in the third amended complaint that was filed on june  on september  and october   the amcare tx receiver and the amcare ok receivers  respectively  intervened in the pending amcare la litigation 
the actions before the texas state court remained pending despite these interventions 
following the intervention in the amcare la action  all three receivers amended their complaints to assert essentially the same claims and successfully moved to consolidate their three actions in louisiana 
the consolidation occurred in november the consolidated actions then proceeded rapidly through extensive pre trial activities  including discovery and motions for summary judgment 
on april   the court granted our motion for summary judgment on the grounds that amcareco s mismanagement of the three plans after the sale was a superseding cause of approximately million of plaintiffs claimed damages 
on may   the court reconsidered that ruling and entered a new order 
table of contents denying our summary judgment motion 
the other defendants in the consolidated actions settled with plaintiffs before the pre trial proceedings were completed in early june following the court s reversal of its ruling on our summary judgment motion  the court scheduled a trial date of june   despite our repeated requests for a continuance to allow us to complete trial preparations and despite our argument that the louisiana court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims of the texas and oklahoma receivers due to the pendency of our appeal from the louisiana court s earlier order denying our venue objection 
prior to the commencement of trial  the court severed and stayed our claims against certain of the settling defendants 
as noted above  there is substantially identical litigation against us pending in texas 
on january   the texas court ordered that the texas action be stayed 
the court ordered the parties to submit quarterly reports regarding the status of the appeal in the louisiana litigation 
the texas court will review those quarterly reports and determine whether the stay should remain in place pending the appeal in the louisiana case 
we have vigorously contested all of the claims asserted against us by the amcare tx receiver and the other plaintiffs in the consolidated louisiana actions since they were first filed 
we intend to vigorously pursue all avenues of redress in these cases  including post trial motions and appeals and the prosecution of our pending but stayed cross claims against other parties 
these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their outcome  including the outcome of any appeal  cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period

superior national and capital z financial services on april   we and our former wholly owned subsidiary  foundation health corporation fhc  which merged into health net  inc  in january  were sued by superior national insurance group  inc superior in an action filed in the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california  which was then transferred to the united states district court for the central district of california 
the lawsuit superior lawsuit related to the sale by fhc to superior of the stock of business insurance group  inc big  a holding company of workers compensation insurance companies operating primarily in california 
in the superior lawsuit  superior alleged that fhc made certain misrepresentations and or omissions in connection with the sale of big and breached the stock purchase agreement governing the sale 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with the sntl litigation trust  successor in interest to superior  of the claims alleged in the superior lawsuit 
as part of the settlement  we ultimately agreed to pay the sntl litigation trust million and received a release of the sntl litigation trust s claims against us 
shortly after announcing the settlement  capital z financial services fund ii  lp  and certain of its affiliates collectively  cap z sued us cap z action in new york state court asserting claims arising out of the same big transaction that is the subject of the settlement agreement with the sntl litigation trust 
cap z had previously participated as a creditor in the superior lawsuit and is a beneficiary of the sntl litigation trust 
in its complaint  cap z alleges that we made certain misrepresentations and or omissions that caused cap z to vote its shares of superior in favor of the acquisition of big and to provide approximately million in financing to superior for that transaction 
cap z s complaint primarily alleges that we misrepresented and or concealed material facts relating to the sufficiency of the big companies reserves and about the big companies internal financial condition  including accounts receivables and the status of certain captive insurance programs

no pretrial or trial dates have yet been set in the action 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against cap z s claims 
this case is subject to many uncertainties  and  given its complexity and scope  its final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of the cap z action depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period

provider disputes in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are party to arbitrations and litigation involving providers 
in recent years  a number of these arbitrations and litigation matters have related to alleged stop loss claim underpayments  where we paid a portion of the provider s billings and denied certain charges based on a line by line review of the itemized billing statement to identify supplies and services that should have been included within specific charges and not billed separately

table of contents how we report our results we currently operate within two reportable segments  health plan services and government contracts  each of which is described below 
our health plan services reportable segment includes the operations of our health plans  which offer commercial  medicare and medicaid products in arizona  california  connecticut  new jersey  new york and oregon  the operations of our health and life insurance companies and our behavioral health and pharmaceutical services subsidiaries 
we have approximately million at risk and million administrative services only aso members in our health plan services segment 
our government contracts segment includes our government sponsored managed care federal contract with the us department of defense the department of defense under the tricare program in the north region and other health care related government contracts that we administer for the department of defense 
under the tricare contract for the north region  we provide health care services to approximately million military health system mhs eligible beneficiaries active duty personnel and tricare medicare dual eligible beneficiaries  including million tricare eligibles for whom we provide health care and administrative services and million other mhs eligible beneficiaries for whom we provide aso 
how we measure our profitability our profitability depends in large part on our ability to effectively price our health care products  manage health care costs  including pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  attract and retain members  and manage our g a and selling expenses 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the potential effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers  may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business  and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we measure our health plan services segment profitability based on medical care ratio and pretax income 
the medical care ratio is calculated as health plan services expense divided by health plan services premiums 
the pretax income is calculated as health plan services premium less health plan services expense and g a and other net expenses 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our medical care ratio mcr and results of operations health plan services segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 
health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage  for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
the amount of premiums we earn in a given year is driven by the rates we charge and the enrollment levels 
health plan services expense includes medical and related costs for health services provided to our members  including physician services  hospital and related professional services  outpatient care  and pharmacy benefit costs 
these expenses are impacted by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs represent the health care cost per visit  and the utilization rates represent the volume of health care consumption by our members 
general and administrative expenses include those costs related to employees and benefits  consulting and professional fees  marketing  premium taxes and assessments and occupancy costs 
such costs are driven by membership levels  introduction of new products  system consolidations and compliance requirements for changing regulations 
these expenses also included expenses associated with corporate shared services and other costs to reflect the fact that such expenses are incurred primarily to support health plan services segment 
selling expenses consist of external broker commission expenses and generally vary with premium volume 

table of contents we measure our government contracts segment profitability based on government contracts cost ratio and pretax income 
the government contracts cost ratio is calculated as government contracts cost divided by government contracts revenue 
the pretax income is calculated as government contracts revenue less government contracts cost 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our government contracts cost ratio and results of operations government contracts segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 
government contracts revenue is made up of two major components health care and administrative services 
the health care component includes revenue recorded for health care costs for the provision of services to our members  including paid claims and estimated ibnr expenses for which we are at risk  and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
the administrative services component encompasses fees received for all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contract with the government

table of contents summary of operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  before the start of  our objectives were to remain focused on disciplined pricing  contain the growth in health care costs  eliminate prior period reserve restatements eg  actual liability is different than previously estimated  stabilize or reverse the decline in commercial membership  improve pretax profit margins  increase statutory capital and strengthen the balance sheet  complete the transition to our tricare contract for the north region  and to successfully prepare for the medicare part d drug benefit opportunity 
the results of our efforts to meet these objectives are discussed below 
net income improved to million in  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in results in reflect the impact of million in litigation  asset impairment and restructuring charges 
included in the charges are million related to the may settlement agreement to resolve the lead physician provider track action in the multidistrict class action lawsuit  and million of estimated legal defense costs to appeal a louisiana state court jury verdict related to the sale of three health plan subsidiaries 
see item legal proceedings for additional information on these litigation matters 
results for the year ended december  included a million pretax charge recorded in the fourth quarter ended december   which is discussed in more detail below 
one of our key objectives in was to effectively manage our commercial health care costs and to ensure that pricing was consistent with improving health care cost trends in order to accomplish better mcrs and improve profit margins 
pretax profit margins improved during every quarter in  and the pretax profit margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in commercial premium pmpm was for the year ended december  compared to the same period in we believe we are now in a better position to be more competitive and manage premium rate increases that are consistent with the favorable health care cost trends that we are experiencing 
commercial health plan membership declined at december  when compared to december   however  the rate of membership decline has begun to slow 
the health plan services mcr declined to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   primarily driven by a million provider dispute charge recorded in the fourth quarter ended december  favorable commercial health care cost trends also contributed to the improvement 
the commercial health care cost trend for  after adjusting for the provider dispute charge recorded in the fourth quarter ended december   was approximately  and we believe this indicates that the health care cost trend is abating 
we believe it also demonstrates that our focus on medical management basics  including prior authorization  concurrent review and discharge planning is showing results 
in  we made focused investments to prepare for the medicare part d drug benefit and to increase health plan marketing and advertising to generate more growth 
in addition  the transition to the new tricare contract for the north region was completed during  and pretax income from this business increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as of december   we had settled approximately of the provider disputes related to the million charge recorded in the fourth quarter ended december  we believe that the remaining liability amount of million is sufficient to settle the remaining disputes 

table of contents statutory capital is another key measure that improved substantially in our objective in was to improve our risk based capital rbc ratio to as part of our ongoing effort to have our senior unsecured debt rating upgraded 
as of december   our rbc ratio was approximately 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  improved to million compared to million for the year ended december   which was consistent with our expectations 
we believe that in order to remain competitive in our health plan services segment in  we will need to continue our focus on improving profit margins in commercial and medicare health plans  stabilize commercial health plan membership  successfully launch the medicare part d drug benefit and complete the universal care acquisition 
we believe that the decline in commercial health plan membership will continue to slow in however  because of some large group departures  we expect commercial health plan membership to decline between and in the first quarter of in addition  the task of stabilizing new jersey and california small group membership continues to be challenging  but the prospect of increasing membership enrollment in other markets and areas of our business are more encouraging 
we expect membership to stabilize by the end of the second quarter of and start to grow in the latter part of therefore  we believe that commercial health plan membership at december  will be relatively flat when compared to december   including the new commercial membership that we expect to receive upon closing of our universal care acquisition 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in as we focus more on investing in growth and on our ongoing investment in medicare 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  in  our overall financial results fell short of our expectations 
earnings per share fell by to per basic and diluted share for  compared with per basic share and per diluted share in  primarily as a result of higher than anticipated commercial health care costs and lower membership 
in addition  as described below  we recorded a million pretax earnings charge in the fourth quarter ended december   which had a significant impact on our overall financial results 
beginning in the latter part of the first quarter ended march   we began to implement a plan designed to improve financial performance financial performance improvement plan 
as part of the financial performance improvement plan  we increased prices in our commercial health plans and commenced a series of initiatives designed to reduce the growth rate of our commercial health care costs 
following implementation of the financial performance improvement plan  the rate of increase in commercial pmpm premium yields climbed from a increase in the first quarter ended march  compared with the first quarter ended march   to a increase in the fourth quarter ended december  compared with the fourth quarter ended december  we believe that the implementation of higher premiums caused employer groups  many of which had high health care cost trends  to leave our health plans and obtain coverage elsewhere  which resulted in an overall decrease in commercial health plan enrollment from december  to december  the losses were greatest in our california and northeast health plans 
in the fourth quarter ended december   we recorded a million pretax earnings charge which was comprised of the following million of expenses associated with provider settlements  including legal costs  relating to claims processing and payment issues that have been or are being resolved  million of expenses for adverse reserve developments  most of which relates to the second and third quarters of  and million in severance  asset impairment and restructuring charges and other expenses 

table of contents provider settlement expenses 
following a thorough review of outstanding provider disputes and management s decision in the fourth quarter ended december  to settle a large number of provider disputes  we recorded an amount for provider settlements that reflects what we believe is a reasonable estimate to bring all of these matters to closure 
these provider disputes were primarily in our california health plan and related to claims issues extending as far back as for additional information regarding our provider disputes  see item legal proceedings provider disputes and results of operations health plan services costs 
reserve developments 
the fourth quarter pretax earnings charge also included amounts recorded for prior period adverse reserve developments  most of which related to revisions to reserve estimates for the second and third quarters of approximately million of the million recorded for prior period adverse reserve developments relate to for information regarding our reserve restatements for december  and prior  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the adverse reserve developments are directly related to management s decision in to accelerate claims payment practices and disengage from the claims review practices  both designed to improve relations with providers 
as a result of deliberate actions to accelerate claims payments  we experienced higher level of paid claims in the first quarter of compared with these higher levels of paid claims persisted through the balance of and contributed to the increase in commercial health care costs 
this had the impact of masking the increasing trend in health care costs until the fourth quarter of when higher levels of paid claims than were previously estimated emerged 
the reserves established at december  assume a permanent increase in claims costs because of these changes 
severance  asset impairment and restructuring charges and other miscellaneous expenses 
we recorded million of miscellaneous items as part of the fourth quarter pretax earnings charge  including severance and related benefit costs  lease terminations  the write off of certain investments and it assets and other balance sheet items 
for information regarding these balance sheet items  see results of operations litigation  severance and related benefit costs and asset impairments

california membership  where the program is known as medi cal  comprised of our medicaid membership at december  overall medicaid membership decreased at december  compared to december   primarily as a result of competition in new jersey  a change in law that eliminated certain members eligibility in connecticut and the state of california s efforts to tighten eligibility requirements for participation in the medi cal and healthy families program 
in the third quarter of  we added a new county in california  accounting for approximately  new members 
despite ongoing concerns about the states ability to adequately fund these medicaid programs  we believe that the significant savings generated by medicaid managed care will provide ongoing future growth opportunities  as states may move more medicaid enrollees into managed care plans

liquidity and capital resources liquidity we believe that cash flow from operating activities  existing working capital  lines of credit and cash reserves are adequate to allow us to fund existing obligations  introduce new products and services  and continue to develop health care related businesses 
we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments  and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through issuance of debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise  as appropriate 
our cash flow from operating activities is impacted by  among other things  the timing of collections on our amounts receivable from our tricare contract for the north region 
health care receivables related to tricare are best estimates of payments that are ultimately collectible or payable 
the timing of collection of such receivables is impacted by government audit and negotiation and can extend for periods beyond a year 
amounts receivable under government contracts were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities for and were impacted by the effects of the transition to the new tricare contract 
under the old tricare contracts  we were required to set aside million in cash for the payment of run out claims as of december  which we completed in during the third quarter of  we paid million to the government in bid price adjustments which had been previously accrued for as part of closing out the legacy contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax charge of million for expenses associated with provider settlements that had been or are currently in the process of being resolved  principally involving the 
table of contents alleged underpayment of stop loss claims 
included in the pretax charge was million related to the health care portion of the provider settlements and million related to legal costs 
most of the settlements involved california hospitals  and the claims at issue dated back to the remaining provider disputes liability balance relating to this pretax charge was million as of december  the cash payments for provider dispute settlements have been funded by cash flows from operations 
during the year ended december   no significant modification was made to the original estimated provider dispute liability amount  as we believed that the amount was adequate in all material respects to cover the outstanding estimated provider dispute settlements

operating cash flows our operating cash flows for the years ended december   and are as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash from operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following net increase in net income plus amortization  depreciation and other net non cash charges of million  net increase in cash flows from amounts receivable payable under government contracts of million  primarily due to the transition to the tricare contract for the north region  partially offset by increase in provider dispute payments of million related to the provider dispute charge reserve provided for in the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash from operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the following net decrease in net income plus amortization  depreciation and other net non cash charges of million  net decrease in cash flows from amounts receivable payable under government contracts of million  primarily due to the transition to the new tricare contract for the north region  and delayed receipt of an expected medicare payment of million for our california and new york health plans 
investing activities our cash flow from investing activities is primarily impacted by the sales  maturities and purchases of our available for sale investment securities and restricted investments 
our investment objective is to maintain safety and preservation of principal by investing in high quality  investment grade securities while maintaining liquidity in each portfolio sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements and attaining the highest total return on invested funds 

table of contents our cash flows from investing activities for the years ended december   and are as follows dollars in millions net cash used in investing activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  due primarily to an increase in available funds not required for operations that were placed in long term investments  offset by the proceeds received in june in connection with the sale leaseback transaction 
on june   we entered into an agreement in which we sold certain of our non real estate fixed assets to an independent third party for net cash proceeds of million the sale leaseback transaction and simultaneously leased such assets from an independent third party under an operating lease for an initial term of three years the lease agreement 
the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction were used to increase the capital level of our california health plan 
payments under the lease agreement are million per quarter  plus interest  payable in arrears 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale leaseback transaction 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the following net increase in maturities and sales of available for sale securities of million  net decrease in purchases of property and equipment of million  partially offset by net increase in purchases of restricted investments of million as required under our old tricare contracts in connection with the run out claims  and net decrease in cash proceeds from divestitures of million 
financing activities our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december   and are as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by used in financing activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities increased by million due to a decrease of million in repurchases of our common stock combined with an increase in cash proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases when compared to the prior year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in financing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in under our stock repurchase program compared to  shares for million in in addition  we paid million for  shares repurchased in and settled in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases declined by million 

table of contents capital structure stock repurchase program our board of directors has previously authorized us to repurchase up to million net of exercise proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of our common stock under a stock repurchase program 
after giving effect to realized exercise proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  our total authority under our stock repurchase program is estimated at million 
share repurchases are made under our stock repurchase program from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we had repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program at an average price of for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program as of december  was million after taking into account exercise proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options 
we used net free cash available to the parent company to fund the share repurchases 
as a result of the moody s downgrade in september and s p s downgrade in november with respect to our senior unsecured debt rating  we have currently discontinued our repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program 
our decision to resume the repurchase of shares under our stock repurchase program will depend on a number of factors  including  without limitation  any future ratings action taken by moody s or s p on our senior unsecured debt rating 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the moody s and s p downgrades 
our stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
as of december   we have not terminated any repurchase program prior to its expiration date 
senior notes our senior notes consist of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of april  the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if either moody s or s p downgrades the rating ascribed to the senior notes below investment grade as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes 
on september   moody s announced that it had downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from baa to ba  which triggered an adjustment to the interest rate payable by us on our senior notes 
as a result of the moody s downgrade  effective september   the interest rate on the senior notes increased from the original rate of per annum to an adjusted rate of per annum  resulting in an increase in our interest expense of million on an annual basis 
on november   s p announced that it had downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bb  and on march   s p further downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from bb to bb 
on may   moody s further downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from ba to ba the adjusted interest rate of per annum will remain in effect for so long as the moody s rating on our senior unsecured debt remains below baa or the equivalent or the s p rating on our senior unsecured debt remains below bbb or the equivalent 
during any period in which the moody s rating on our senior unsecured debt is baa or the equivalent or higher and the s p rating on our senior unsecured debt is bbb or the equivalent or higher  the interest rate payable on the senior notes will be equal to the original rate of per annum 
semi annual interest is payable on april and october of each year 
the senior notes are redeemable  at our option  at a price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed  and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the senior notes to be redeemed consisting of principal and interest  exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption  at the rate in effect on the date of calculation of the redemption price  discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the applicable yield to maturity as specified in the indenture governing the senior notes plus basis points plus  in each case  accrued interest to the date of redemption 

table of contents on february   we entered into swap contracts to hedge against interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate senior notes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding the swap contracts 
in an effort to lower our interest expense on the senior notes  we are currently considering our financing alternatives  including refinancing or repurchasing our senior notes 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing  are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors

risk factors we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
senior credit facility we have a million senior credit facility under a five year revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  swing line lender and l c issuer  jp morgan chase bank  as syndication agent  and the other lenders party thereto 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under our senior credit facility and our maximum commitment level under our senior credit facility was million 
borrowings under our senior credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  and to service our working capital needs 
we must repay all borrowings  if any  under our senior credit facility by june   unless the maturity date under the senior credit facility is extended 
interest on any amount outstanding under the senior credit facility is payable monthly at a rate per annum of a libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points or b the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus  plus a margin of up to basis points 
we have also incurred and will continue to incur customary fees in connection with the senior credit facility 
our senior credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum net worth and a limitation on dividends and distributions 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to our senior credit facility 
we can obtain letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million under our senior credit facility  which reduces the maximum amount available for borrowing under our senior credit facility 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million in letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior credit facility primarily to secure surety bonds issued in connection with litigation see contractual obligations below 
in addition  we secured a letter of credit effective january  in the amount of million to cover risk of insolvency for the state of arizona 
no amounts have been drawn on any of these letters of credit 
as a result of the issuance of these letters of credit  the maximum amount available for borrowing under the senior credit facility was million as of january  due to the moody s and s p downgrades of our senior unsecured debt rating as discussed above  we are currently prohibited under the terms of the senior credit facility from making dividends  distributions or redemptions in respect of our capital stock in excess of million in any consecutive four quarter period  are subject to a minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio rather than the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  are subject to additional reporting requirements to the lenders  and are subject to increased interest and fees applicable to any outstanding borrowings and any letters of credit secured under the senior credit facility 
the minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio calculates the fixed charge on a parent company only basis 
in the event either moody s or s p upgrades our senior unsecured debt rating to at least baa or bbb  respectively  our coverage ratio will revert back to the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 

table of contents on march   we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility 
the amendment  among other things  amends the definition of consolidated ebitda to exclude up to million relating to cash and non cash  non recurring charges in connection with litigation and provider settlement payments  any increase in medical claims reserves and any premiums relating to the repayment or refinancing of our senior notes to the extent such charges cause a corresponding reduction in consolidated net worth as defined in the senior credit facility 
such exclusion from the calculation of the consolidated ebitda was applicable to the five fiscal quarter periods commencing with the fiscal quarter ended december  and ending with the fiscal quarter ended december  on august   we entered into a second amendment to our senior credit facility 
the second amendment  among other things  amends the definition of minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio to exclude from the calculation of minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio any capital contributions made by the parent company to its regulated subsidiaries if such capital contribution is derived from the proceeds of a sale  transfer  lease or other disposition of the parent company s assets 
statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
management believes that as of december   all of our health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which generally represents the minimum amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries  for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
we generally manage our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital against of acl 
at december   we had sufficient capital to exceed this level 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash or other assets to the parent company 
as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
health net  inc elected to contribute million in cash and million in property to certain of its subsidiaries during the year ended december  to further strengthen such subsidiaries rbc 
except for the million and million in capital contributions  our parent company did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations during the year ended december  or thereafter through the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
legislation has been or may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 

table of contents as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived  or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus 
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations as of december  and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending december total thereafter dollars in millions long term debt operating leases other purchase obligations deferred compensation estimated future payments for pension and other benefits a a represents estimated future payments from through operating leases we lease office space under various operating leases

other purchase obligations other purchase obligations include payments due under agreements for goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have included in the table set forth under the heading contractual obligations above  obligations related to a three year pharmacy benefit services agreement  a five year agreement for a nurse advice line and other related services  and a five year agreement for a disease and condition management services 
we have excluded from such table amounts already recorded in our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also excluded from such table various contracts we have entered into with our health care providers  health care facilities  the federal government and other contracts that we have entered into for the purpose of providing health care services 
we have excluded those contracts that allow for cancellation without significant penalty  obligations that are contingent upon achieving certain goals and contracts for goods and services that are fulfilled by vendors within a short time horizon and within the normal course of business 
the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available 
the timing of and the actual payment amounts may differ based on actual events 

table of contents surety bonds in order to secure judgment pending our appeal in the amcareco litigation  we obtained surety bonds totaling million  which are further secured by letters of credit in the amounts of million issued in december see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and recoverability of long lived assets and investments 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage  for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
from time to time  we make adjustments to our revenues based on retroactivity 
these retroactivity adjustments reflect changes in the number of enrollees subsequent to when the revenue is billed 
we estimate the amount of future retroactivity each period and accordingly adjust the billed revenue 
the estimated adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of contract renewal activity during the period and other information 
we refine our estimates and methodologies as information on actual retroactivity becomes available 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 
reserves for claims and other settlements and health care and other costs payable under government contracts include reserves for claims incurred but not reported claims ibnr and received but unprocessed 
table of contents claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves for our two reporting segments  health plan services and government contracts 
as of december   health plan services reserves for claims comprised approximately of reserves for claims and other settlements 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed in the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims is highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million medical cost trend b increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions or changes  environmental changes or other factors 
in california  there were significant improvements in the claims processing that had a material impact upon the reserve levels as of december  none of the other factors had a material impact on the 
table of contents development of our claims payable estimates during any of the periods presented in this annual report on form k 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most recent months 
in developing its best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology listed above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims includes various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claims processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
hn of california  our california hmo  generally contracts with various medical groups to provide professional care to certain of its members on a capitated  or fixed per member per month fee basis 
capitation contracts generally include a provision for stop loss and non capitated services for which we are liable 
professional capitated contracts also generally contain provisions for shared risk 
we have risk sharing arrangements with certain of our providers related to approximately  members  primarily in the california commercial market 
shared risk arrangements provide for us to share with our providers the variance between actual costs and predetermined goals 
our health plans in connecticut  new jersey and new york market to small employer groups through a marketing agreement with the guardian 
we have approximately  members under this agreement 
in general  we share equally with the guardian in the profits of the marketing agreement  subject to certain terms of the marketing agreement related to expenses 
our hmos in other states also contract with hospitals  physicians and other providers of health care  pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements  hospital per diems  and case rates under which providers bill the hmos for each individual service provided to enrollees 
additionally  we contract with certain hospitals to provide hospital care to enrolled members on a capitation basis 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include margin assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held a premium deficiency reserve of million as of december  government contracts during the second half of  we transitioned from our old tricare contracts to our tricare contract for the north region 
as a result  the development of claim payment patterns for this new contract is limited and is not as mature when compared to that for our old tricare contracts and our managed care businesses 
in addition  there are different variables that impact the estimate of the ibnr reserves for our tricare business than those that impact our managed care businesses 
these variables consist of changes in the level of our nation s military activity  including the call up of reservists in support of heightened military activity  continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries  changes in the health care facilities in which the eligible beneficiaries seek treatment  and revisions to the provisions of the contract in the form of change orders 
each of these factors is subject to significant judgment  and we have incorporated our best estimate of these factors in estimating the reserve for ibnr claims 
as part of our tricare contract for the north region  we have a risk sharing arrangement with the federal government whereby variances in actual claim experience from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid are shared 
due to this risk sharing arrangement provided for in the tricare contract for the north region  the changes in the estimate of the ibnr reserves are not expected to have a material effect on the favorable or adverse development of our liability under the tricare contract 

table of contents the tricare north region contract is made up of two major revenue components  health care and administrative services 
health care services revenue includes health care costs  including paid claims and estimated ibnr expenses  for care provided for which we are at risk and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
administrative services revenue encompasses all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contracts with the government 
revenues associated with the transition to the new tricare contract for the north region are recognized over the entire term of the contract 
under our new tricare contract for the north region we recognize amounts receivable and payable under the government contracts related to estimated health care ibnr expenses which are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  these amounts are the same since all of the estimated health care ibnr expenses incurred are offset by an equal amount of revenues earned 
health care costs and associated revenues are recognized as the costs are incurred and the associated revenue is earned 
revenue related to administrative services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
other government contracts revenues are recognized in the month in which the eligible beneficiaries are entitled to health care services or in the month in which the administrative services are performed or the period that coverage for services is provided 
revenue under the expired former region  region and regions  and contracts was subject to price adjustments attributable to inflation and other factors 
the effects of these adjustments were recognized on a monthly basis  with the final determination of these amounts occurring in some of the amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of price adjustments and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
change orders arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value is defined or negotiated 
we start to incur costs immediately  before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue 
our policy is to collect and defer the costs incurred 
once we have submitted a cost proposal to the government  we will record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 
reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies that relate to our services and or business practices 
we and several of our competitors were named as defendants in a number of significant class action lawsuits alleging violations of various federal statutes  including the employee retirement income security act of and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act 
see item legal proceedings for additional information regarding these class actions 
we recognize an estimated loss from such loss contingencies when we believe it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  our relevant insurance coverage  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
while the final outcome of these proceedings cannot be determined at this time  based on information presently available we believe that the final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  our belief regarding the likely outcome of such proceedings could change in the future and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  the ultimate outcome of these loss contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty and it is difficult to measure the actual loss  if any  that might be incurred 

table of contents goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually based on the estimated fair value of our health plan services reportable segment 
we test for impairment on a more frequent basis in cases where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of goodwill 
our measurement of fair value is based on utilization of both the income and market approaches to fair value determination 
as a part of assessing impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform fair value measurements using different methodologies 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based upon converting expected cash flows to present value 
annual cash flows are estimated for each year of a defined multi year period until the growth pattern becomes stable 
the expected interim cash flows expected after the growth pattern becomes stable are calculated using an appropriate capitalization technique and then discounted 
the market approach uses a market valuation methodology which includes the selection of companies engaged in a line or lines of business similar to ours to be valued and an analysis of our comparative operating results and future prospects in relation to those of the guideline companies selected 
the market price multiples are selected and applied to us based on our relative performance  future prospects and risk profiles in comparison to those of the guideline companies 
methodologies for selecting guideline companies include the exchange methodology and the acquisition methodology 
the exchange methodology is based upon transactions of minority interests in publicly traded companies engaged in a line or lines of business similar to ours 
the public companies selected are defined as guideline companies 
the acquisition methodology involved analyzing the transaction involving similar companies that have been bought and sold in the public marketplace 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting units  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings based on current and future plans and initiatives 
if these planned initiatives do not accomplish their targeted objectives  the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected and have a material effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets held for sale long lived assets are classified as held for sale when certain criteria are met  which include management commitment to a plan to sell the assets  the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition  whether an active program to locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets have been initiated  whether the 
table of contents sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  whether the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value and how unlikely it is that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets 
we measure long lived assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices or the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale we classify an asset or asset group that will be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until the disposal transaction occurs 
the asset or asset group continues to be depreciated based on revisions to its estimated useful life until the date of disposal or abandonment 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining period of use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
we file tax returns in many tax jurisdictions and  often  application of tax rules within the various jurisdictions is subject to differing interpretation 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that it is probable certain positions will be challenged by taxing authorities  and we may not prevail on the positions as filed 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for the estimated amount of contingent tax challenges by taxing authorities upon examination  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the reserve is comprised of amounts for specific issues arising in periods subject to examination  and amounts are released from the reserve upon closure of such examinations or upon closure of the statute of limitations for assessment 
the estimates of contingent tax costs comprising the reserve balance have been developed after careful analysis of the applicable statutory authority and court case precedent 
as such  we believe that the reserve reflects the probable outcome of contingent tax challenges and that the probability of material assessments above the reserve balance is remote 
the reserve is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit profiles and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception may affect the value of financial instruments 

table of contents we have several bond portfolios to fund reserves 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset liability duration of our investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december  our calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
in addition to the market risk associated with its investments  we have interest rate risk due to our fixed rate borrowings 
we use interest rate swap contracts swap contracts as a part of our hedging strategy to manage certain exposures related to the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our senior notes 
on february   we entered into four swap contracts related to the senior notes 
under the swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swap contracts are entered into with a number of major financial institutions in order to reduce counterparty credit risk 
the swap contracts have an aggregate principal notional amount of million and effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the senior notes to a variable rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the swap contracts 
the interest rate on borrowings under our senior credit facility  of which there were none as of december   is subject to change because of the varying interest rates that apply to borrowings under the senior credit facility 
for additional information regarding our senior credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these borrowings  if any  are based on prevailing market rates 

table of contents the fair value of our fixed rate borrowing as of december  was approximately million  which was based on mark to market quotations from a third party provider 
the following table presents the expected cash outflows relating to market risk sensitive debt obligations as of december  these cash outflows include both expected principal and interest payments consistent with the terms of the outstanding debt as of december  prior to entering into the swap contracts 
thereafter total amounts in millions fixed rate borrowing principal interest valuation of interest rate swap contracts a cash outflow on fixed rate borrowing a expected cash outflow from swap contracts as of the most recent practicable date of january  is million  million  million  million  million and million for     and thereafter  respectively
