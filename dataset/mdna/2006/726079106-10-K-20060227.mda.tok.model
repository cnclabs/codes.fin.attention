item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
capital resources 
as of december   we exceeded each of the capital requirements to be deemed well capitalized 
as of december   we own the common stock of trusts that have issued million of trust preferred securities 
these securities are currently included in our tier capital for purposes of determining our tier and total risk based capital ratios 
as discussed above  effective march   we will be required to use a more restrictive formula to determine the amount of trust preferred securities that can be included in regulatory tier capital 
we have determined that our tier capital ratios would remain above the well capitalized level had the modification of the capital regulations been in effect at december  we expect our tier capital ratios will be at or above the well capitalized levels on march  for more information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
capital resources 
the risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  which emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements  currently becomes mandatory in only for banks with over billion in assets or total on balance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more 
alternative capital requirements are under consideration by the us federal banking agencies for smaller us banks which may be negatively impacted competitively by certain provisions of basel ii 
in addition  federal banking regulators may set capital requirements higher than the minimums described above for financial institutions whose circumstances warrant it 
for example  a financial institution experiencing or anticipating significant growth may be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
prompt corrective action federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed  based on its capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the regulations use an institution s risk based capital  leverage capital and tangible capital ratios to determine the institution s capital classification 
an institution is treated as well capitalized if its total capital to risk weighted assets ratio is or more  its core capital to risk weighted assets ratio is or more  and its core capital to adjusted total assets ratio is or more 
at december   the bank exceeded the required ratios for classification as well capitalized 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment 
safety and soundness standards in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound 
table of contents practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
finally  pursuant to an interagency agreement  the fdic can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination score or is considered undercapitalized without the express permission of the institution s primary regulator 
the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  asset growth  earnings  and compensation  fees and benefits 
in addition  the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards 
these guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating 
under these standards  an insured depository institution should conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets  estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses  compare problem asset totals to capital  take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets  consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations  and provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk 
these guidelines also set forth standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
premiums for deposit insurance through the bank insurance fund  the fdic insures our customer deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bank insurance fund member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors 
specifically  the assessment rate is based on the institution s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category 
an institution s capitalization risk category is based on the fdic s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
an institution s supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required 
fdic insured depository institutions pay an assessment rate equal to the rate assessed on deposits insured by the savings association insurance fund 
the assessment rate currently ranges from zero to cents per of domestic deposits 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi annual basis 
due to continued growth in deposits and some recent bank failures  the bank insurance fund is nearing its 
table of contents minimum ratio of of insured deposits as mandated by law 
if the ratio drops below  it is likely the fdic will be required to assess premiums on all banks 
any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the amount of the increase 
furthermore  the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
all fdic insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the bonds  commonly referred to as fico bonds  were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the fdic established the fico assessment rates effective for the first quarter of fiscal was basis points for each of assessable deposits 
the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fdic s insurance funds and do not vary depending on a depository institution s capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
loans to one borrower limitation with certain limited exceptions  the maximum amount that a california bank may lend to any borrower at any one time including the obligations to the bank of certain related entities of the borrower may not exceed and unsecured loans may not exceed of the bank s shareholders equity  allowance for loan losses  and any capital notes and debentures of the bank 
extensions of credit to insiders and transactions with affiliates the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation o place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director or principal shareholder 
loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan to one borrower limits  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
in addition  regulation o provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
regulation o also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank 
the bank also is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to  or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of  any affiliates  the purchase of  or investments in  stock or 
table of contents other securities thereof  the taking of such securities as collateral for loans  and the purchase of assets of any affiliates 
such restrictions prevent any affiliates from borrowing from us unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
further  such secured loans and investments by us to or in any affiliate are limited  individually  to of our capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations  and such secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of our capital and surplus 
some of the entities included in the definition of an affiliate are parent companies  sister banks  sponsored and advised companies  investment companies whereby the bank s affiliate serves as investment advisor  and financial subsidiaries of the bank 
additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on us under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law

usa patriot act of the usa patriot act of and its implementing regulations significantly expanded the anti money laundering and financial transparency laws 
under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are subject to prohibitions regarding specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
for example  the enhanced due diligence policies  procedures  and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transaction  to ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of  and the source of funds deposited into  each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions  to ascertain for any foreign bank  the shares of which are not publicly traded  the identity of the owners of the foreign bank  and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner  and to ascertain whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and  if so  the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information 
under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are required to establish and maintain anti money laundering programs which included the establishment of a customer identification program  the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test the programs 
our bank has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to address the requirements of the usa patriot act 
material deficiencies in anti money laundering compliance can result in public enforcement actions by the banking agencies  including the imposition of civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion 
such actions could have serious reputation consequences for us and our bank 
consumer protection laws and regulations examination and enforcement by the bank regulatory agencies for non compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations have become more intense in nature 
the bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations  some of which are discussed below 
the home ownership and equal protection act of  or hoepa  requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers for certain lending practices 
the term predatory lending  much like the 
table of contents terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced loan flipping  and or engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
federal reserve regulations and office of the comptroller of the currency guidelines aimed at curbing predatory lending significantly widen the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by hoepa 
in addition  the regulations bar certain refinances within a year with another loan subject to hoepa by the same lender or loan servicer 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans should not be made to people unable to repay them unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
we do not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
privacy policies are required by federal banking regulations which limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to those rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
in addition  state laws may impose more restrictive limitations on the ability of financial institutions to disclose such information 
california has adopted such a privacy law that among other things generally provides that customers must opt in before information may be disclosed to certain nonaffiliated third parties 
the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act  or fact  requires financial firms to help deter identity theft  including developing appropriate fraud response programs  and give consumers more control of their credit data 
it also reauthorizes a federal ban on state laws that interfere with corporate credit granting and marketing practices 
in connection with fact  financial institution regulatory agencies proposed rules that would prohibit an institution from using certain information about a consumer it received from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer  unless the consumer has been notified and given a chance to opt out of such solicitations 
a consumer s election to opt out would be applicable for at least five years 
the check clearing for the st century act  or check  facilitates check truncation and electronic check exchange by authorizing a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check  which is the legal equivalent of an original check 
check does not require banks to create substitute checks or accept checks electronically  however  it does require banks to accept a legally equivalent substitute check in place of an original 
in addition to its issuance of regulations governing substitute checks the federal reserve has issued final rules governing the treatment of remotely created checks sometimes referred to as demand drafts and electronic check conversion transactions involving checks that are converted to electronic transactions by merchants and other payees 

table of contents the equal credit opportunity act  or ecoa  generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the truth in lending act  or tila  is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments  including the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total of payments and the payment schedule  among other things 
the fair housing act  or fh act  regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
a number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
the community reinvestment act  or cra  is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the agencies use the cra assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
in its last examination for cra compliance  as of march   the bank was rated satisfactory 
the home mortgage disclosure act  or hmda  grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods and provides public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
the hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
the federal reserve board amended regulations issued under hmda to require the reporting for of certain pricing data with respect to higher priced mortgage loans 
the expanded hmda data is being reviewed by federal banking agencies and others from a fair lending perspective 
we do not expect that the hmda data reported by the bank for will raise material issues regarding the bank s compliance with the fair lending laws 
the real estate settlement procedures act  or respa  requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
penalties under the above laws may include fines  reimbursements and other penalties 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with the cra  tila  fh act  ecoa  hmda and respa generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local community 
proposed guidance on nontraditional mortgage products on december   the federal banking agencies issued for comment proposed guidance on residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and sometimes interest  including interest only mortgage loans  and payment option adjustable rate mortgages where a borrower has flexible payment options  including payments that have the potential for negative amortization 
while acknowledging that innovations in mortgage lending can benefit some consumers  the federal banking agencies in their joint 
table of contents press release stated their concern that these and other practices described in the guidance can present unique risks that institutions must appropriately manage 
the proposed guidance states that management should assess a borrower s ability to repay the loan  including any balances added through negative amortization  at the fully indexed rate that would apply after the introductory period  recognize that certain nontraditional mortgages are untested in a stressed environment and warrant strong risk management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan loss reserves  and ensure that borrowers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks prior to making a product or payment choice 
it is uncertain at this time whether guidance will be adopted in final form and  if adopted  whether and to what extent final guidance may differ from the proposal and what effect the final guidance may have on financial institutions originating such residential mortgage products including the bank 
change in control the bhca  and the change in bank control act of  as amended  together with regulations of the federal reserve  require that  depending on the particular circumstances  either federal reserve approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the federal reserve and not disapproved prior to any person or entity acquiring control of a state member bank  such as the bank  subject to exemptions for some transactions 
control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or entity acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank 
control is rebuttably presumed to exist if an entity acquires or more but less than of any class of voting securities and either the entity has registered securities under section of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following risks may affect us 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
changes in economic conditions could materially hurt our business 
our business is directly affected by factors such as economic  political and market conditions  broad trends in industry and finance  legislative and regulatory changes  changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation  all of which are beyond our control 
we are particularly affected by economic conditions in the state of california 
deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  
table of contents low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease  and collateral for loans made by us  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
in view of the geographic concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in both northern and southern california  we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of any of these consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our growth and expansion may strain our ability to manage our operations and our financial resources 
our financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy 
in addition to seeking deposit and loan and lease growth in our existing markets  we intend to pursue expansion opportunities through strategically placed new branches  by acquiring community banks in identified strategic markets  or by acquiring branch locations that we find attractive 
continued growth  however  may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced 
our growth may place a strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and increase demands on our systems and controls 
we plan to pursue opportunities to expand our business through internally generated growth and acquisitions 
this business growth may require continued enhancements to and expansion of our operating and financial systems and controls and may strain or significantly challenge them 
the process of consolidating the businesses and implementing the strategic integration of any acquired businesses with our existing business may take a significant amount of time 
it may also place additional strain on our resources and could subject us to additional expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate these businesses successfully or in a timely manner 
in addition  our existing operating and financial control systems and infrastructure may not be adequate to maintain and effectively monitor future growth 
our continued growth may also increase our need for qualified personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
the following risks  associated with our growth  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows our inability to continue to upgrade or maintain effective operating and financial control systems  our inability to recruit and hire necessary personnel or to successfully integrate new personnel into our operations  our inability to integrate successfully the operations of acquired businesses or to manage our growth effectively  and our inability to respond promptly or adequately to the emergence of unexpected expansion difficulties 
we face risks associated with acquisitions relating to difficulties in integrating combined operations  potential disruption of operations and related negative impact on earnings  and incurrence of substantial expenses 
growth through acquisitions represents a component of our business strategy 
we expect to acquire banks and branches in strategic markets 
any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions 
these risks include  among other things the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired banks and branches  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  
table of contents the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems  and the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that our integration of the operations of acquired banks or branches will be successfully accomplished 
our inability to improve the operating performance of acquired banks and branches or to integrate successfully their operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the purchase price of banks or branches that might be attractive acquisition candidates for us may significantly exceed the fair values of their net assets 
as a result  material goodwill and other intangible assets would be required to be recorded 
in connection with acquisitions  we could incur substantial expenses  including the expenses of integrating the business of the acquired bank or branch with our existing business 
we expect that competition for appropriate candidates may be significant 
we may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies  many of which may be larger or have greater financial and other resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable banks or branches on acceptable terms and conditions 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the california community banking industry 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of our senior executive management team of messer s ronald w 
bachli  randall e 
reynoso and david e 
hooston  who have expertise in community banking and experience in the markets we serve and have targeted for future expansion 
we are also dependent upon a number of other key executives who are california natives or are long time residents and who are integral to implementing our business plan 
the loss of the services of any one of our senior executive management team or other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our balance sheet is asset sensitive 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance 
a substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
at december  our balance sheet was asset sensitive and  as a result  our net interest margin tends to expand in a rising interest rate environment and decline in a falling interest rate environment 
because of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and  in turn  our profitability 
in addition  loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates 
rising interest rates  generally  are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations 
conversely  in rising 
table of contents interest rate environments  loan repayment rates may decline and in falling interest rate environments  loan repayment rates may increase 
falling interest rate environments may cause additional refinancing of commercial real estate and family residence loans  which may depress our loan volumes or cause rates on loans to decline 
in addition  an increase in the general level of short term interest rates on variable rate loans may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations or reduce the amount they wish to borrow 
additionally  as short term market rates have risen over the past eighteen months we have not proportionally increased interest rates we paid on deposits 
beginning in  we increased rates paid on deposit accounts to retain existing customers and attract new deposit customers 
as short term rates continue to rise  retention of existing deposit customers and the attraction of new deposit customers may require us to continue increasing rates we pay on deposit accounts 
because we deferred increasing rates we paid on deposit accounts during a period of rising short term market rates  we may need to continue to accelerate the pace of rate increases on our deposit accounts as compared to the pace of future increases in short term market rates 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the types of loans in our portfolio have a higher degree of risk and a downturn in our real estate markets could hurt our business 
a downturn in our real estate markets could hurt our business because most of our loans are secured by real estate 
real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes  regulations and policies and acts of nature 
if real estate prices decline  the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be reduced 
our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
as of december   approximately of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate 
substantially all of our real estate collateral is located in california 
the median sales price of an existing single family detached home in california increased from december to december  while the number of homes sold decreased during the same period 
if there is a significant decline in real estate values  especially in california  the collateral for our loans will provide less security 
real estate values could also be negatively affected by  among other things  earthquakes and other natural disasters particular to california 
any such downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we cannot attract deposits  our growth may be inhibited 
we plan to increase significantly the level of our assets  including our loan portfolio 
our ability to increase our assets depends in large part on our ability to attract additional deposits at favorable rates 
we intend to seek additional deposits by offering deposit products that are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our markets and by establishing personal relationships with our customers 
we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful 
our inability to attract additional deposits at competitive rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses could be sustained because borrowers  guarantors  and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases 
the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unexpected losses may arise from a wide variety of specific or systemic factors  many of which are beyond our ability to predict  influence or control 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan and lease defaults and non performance 
our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual 
table of contents loan and lease losses  and future provisions for loan and lease losses could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the allowance for loan and lease losses reflects our estimate of the probable losses in our loan and lease portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is based on prior experience  as well as an evaluation of the known risks in the current portfolio  composition and growth of the loan and lease portfolio and economic factors 
the determination of an appropriate level of loan and lease loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates 
federal and state regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our loans and leases and allowance for loan and lease losses 
while we believe that our allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to cover current losses  we cannot assure you that we will not increase the allowance for loan and lease losses further or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance 
either of these occurrences could have a material adverse affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we rely on communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology from third party service providers  and we may suffer an interruption in those systems that may result in lost business and we may not be able to obtain substitute providers on terms that are as favorable if our relationships with our existing service providers are interrupted 
we rely heavily on third party service providers for much of our communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology 
any failure or interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  servicing and or loan origination systems 
we cannot assure you that such failures or interruptions will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if any of our third party service providers experience financial  operational or technological difficulties  or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them  we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services  and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us  or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources  if at all 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services which could hurt our business 
we conduct our banking operations exclusively in california 
increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the banking services that we offer in our service areas 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions may have larger lending limits which would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
we also face competition from out of state financial intermediaries that have opened loan production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas

if we fail to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities 
effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
as part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control as defined under standards adopted by the public company accounting oversight board  or pcaob  that require remediation 
under the pcaob standards  a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
a significant deficiency is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies  that adversely affect a company s ability to initiate  authorize  record  process  or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected 
as a result of weaknesses that may be identified in our internal controls  we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation 
if we discover weaknesses  we will make efforts to improve our internal and disclosure controls 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  which could affect our ability to remain listed with the nasdaq national market 
ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities

rather than accept the merger consideration of per share of common stock paid to cerritos valley bank shareholders who did not dissent from the merger  the dissenting shareholders claimed that the fair market value of their shares of common stock was per share 
prior to consummation of the merger  bank of orange county deposited the sum of approximately million with the exchange agent for the merger  representing per share multiplied by the number of shares held by dissenting shareholders

under the terms of the agreement  each party s appraiser valued the shares 
after conducting the appraisal  each appraiser reached a different dollar amount 
because the difference between the two amounts exceeded a specified range  the settlement agreement provided that a third appraiser be selected by the two other appraisers  to determine the fair market value of the cerritos valley bank common stock 
the third appraiser determined that the fair market value of the shares held by the dissenting shareholders was 
based on the valuation  the bank paid the dissenting shareholders approximately million
