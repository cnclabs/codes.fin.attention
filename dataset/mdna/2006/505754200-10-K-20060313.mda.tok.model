critical accounting policies deferred income taxes the company has domestic net deferred income tax assets totaling million 
the realization of these assets over time is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
the company has domestic net operating loss nol carryforwards that were generated prior to its reorganization pre reorganization completed on april  as well as nol carryforwards that were generated subsequent to reorganization and prior to the ownership change post reorganization  and nol carryforwards generated in through these nols are available to the company to reduce future taxable income 
the net realizable value of the related tax benefit of the nols is approximately million as of december  the amount of the nol carryforwards used through december  total million of the pre reorganization nols and million of the post reorganization nols 
federal nol carryforwards remaining as of december  total million of pre reorganization nols  million of post reorganization nols and million of nols generated in through wisconsin nol carryforwards remaining as of december  total million of post reorganization nols and million of nols generated in through the company s ipo in march  created an ownership change as defined by the internal revenue service irs 
this ownership change generated an irs imposed limitation on the utilization of nol carryforwards  generated prior to the ownership change  to reduce future taxable income 
the annual use of the nol carryforwards is limited to the lesser of the company s taxable income or the amount of the irs imposed limitation 
since the ownership change  the total nol available for use is million annually 
to the extent less than million is used in any year  the unused amount is added to and increases the limitation in the succeeding year 
pre reorganization nols are further limited to an annual usage of million 
any unused amount is added to and increases the limitation in the succeeding year 
the pre reorganization nols of million expire in the post reorganization nols of million expire in there is no limitation on the usage of the million of nols generated in through and these nols expire in years through because of the annual limitations on the usage of pre reorganization nols and their earlier expiration dates  there is a greater risk of the loss of benefits recorded for these nols 
the net deferred tax asset recorded for the pre reorganization nols approximates million 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires establishment of a valuation allowance for all or a part of the nols unless it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize the nols before they expire 
in determining that realization of the net deferred tax assets was more likely than not  the company gave consideration to a number of factors including its recent earnings history  expectations for earnings in the future  the timing of reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies available to the company and the expiration dates associated with nol carryforwards 
if  in the future  the company determines that it is no longer more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  a valuation allowance will be established against all or part of the net deferred tax assets with an offsetting charge to the income tax provision 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans plans covering a majority of its employees 
in  the company contributed million to the plans which consisted of million in cash and  shares of treasury stock with a fair market value of million 
the company contributed million to the plans in the company intends to contribute  and million to the plans in  and  respectively 
the company plans on funding those contributions from cash on hand  cash generated from operations  working capital reductions  treasury stock contributions and  if necessary  from the facility 
no calculation has been made for payments into the plans beyond the plans assets are held in a trust and are primarily invested in us government securities  investment grade corporate bonds and marketable common stocks 
a number of the plans hold shares of the company s common stock which comprise less than ten percent of any individual plan s total assets 
the key assumptions the company considers with respect to the assets in the plans and funding the liabilities associated with the plans are the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plans assets  the projected rate of increase in compensation levels and the actuarial estimate of mortality of participants in the plans 
the most sensitive assumption is on discount rate 
for funding purposes  the company s independent actuaries assume an annual long term rate of return on plan assets of  a reduction from the rate of return used for prior periods 
for the ten year period ending december   the company experienced an annual rate of return on plan assets of 
the company is currently using a rate of for its discount rate assumption 
the discount rate assumption has declined for five consecutive years 
a decrease in the discount rate results in an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation at the measurement date which may also result in an increase in the additional minimum pension liability included as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income 
such a decrease also results in an actuarial loss which is amortized to pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
an increase in the discount rate will have the opposite effect in the pension liability and pension expense 
the company bases its discount rate on long maturity aa rated corporate debt securities 
the company cannot predict whether these interest rates will increase or decrease in future years 
the company cannot predict the level of interest rates in the future and correspondingly cannot predict the future discount rate which will be applied to determine the company s projected benefit obligation 
as demonstrated in the chart below  relatively small movements in the discount rate  up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s projected benefit obligation under the plans 
projected plan benefit obligation as of december  dollars in millions at discount rate at discount rate at discount rate nor can the company predict with any certainty what the actual rate of return will be for the plans assets 
as demonstrated in the chart below  a modest change in the presumed rate of return on the plans assets will have a material impact upon the actual net periodic cost for the plans 
net periodic cost for year ending december  dollars in millions expected return expected return expected return goodwill goodwill of million  included in other assets on the company s balance sheets  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets relating to business acquisitions 
it is an asset with an indefinite life and therefore is not amortized to expense 
the company s assessment of fair value takes into account a number of factors including ebitda multiples of transactions in the company s industry as well as fair market value multiples of transactions of similarly situated enterprises 
the company tests the goodwill for impairment at least annually by fair value impairment testing 
no impairments were recognized in or should goodwill become impaired in the future  the amount of impairment will be charged to sg a expense 
new accounting pronouncements fasb statement revised  share based payment  is a revision of fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation 
statement revised supersedes accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of these instruments 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized 
this statement was adopted by the company as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter in this statement applies to all awards granted after the effective date and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
by adopting statement revised on october   the company no longer is required to apply variable accounting to its fully vested but unexercised repriced options 
additional compensation expense of million would have been recorded in had statement revised not been adopted 
the company has no unvested options 
other than as described above  the adoption had no material effect on the results of operations or financial position 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that an entity recognize the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
an asset retirement obligation would be reasonably estimable if a it is evident that the fair value of the obligation is embodied in the acquisition price of the asset  b an active market exists for the transfer of the obligation  or c sufficient information exists to apply to an expected present value technique 
fasb interpretation no 
became effective for calendar year enterprises as of december  in applying this statement to the company  it was necessary to determine if the company will undertake any major renovation  sell  dispose or abandon its factory and factory related assets  what liability would be associated with such action  and the date such action would be taken 
the company has three factories in the united states which may be subject to certain conditional retirement obligations 
the company believes it does not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation because the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates has not been specified by others and information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
there are no plans to demolish or undertake any major renovation to the factories that would result in any retirement obligations 
the factories have been and are expected to be maintained by repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve activities resulting in a retirement obligation 
furthermore  there have not been identified any need for major renovations caused by technology changes  operational changes  or other factors 
fasb statement  inventory costs an amendment of fasb no 
 chapter  amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be expensed as current period charges to expense 
this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred by the company beginning january  the company is currently evaluating what effect  if any  adoption of this statement will have on its financial position and results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and trade accounts receivable is immaterial
