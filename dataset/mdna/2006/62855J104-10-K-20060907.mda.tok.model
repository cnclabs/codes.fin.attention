item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biotechnology company focused on the development and marketing of novel therapeutic and molecular diagnostic products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that permit us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins play in the onset and progression of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new healthcare products that will treat major diseases and assess a person s risk of disease later in life 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to undertaking our drug discovery and development programs  operating our predictive medicine business  and continuing our research and development efforts 
we have three reportable operating segments research  predictive medicine  and drug development 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding these operating segments 
our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of predictive medicine products and research payments 
we have yet to attain profitability and  for year ended june   we had a net loss of million 
as of june  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to the expansion of our drug discovery and development efforts  the initiation and continuation of human clinical trials  the launch of new molecular diagnostic products  the performance of our internal research and development programs  and expansion of our facilities 
we incurred research and development expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended june    and respectively 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our pharmaceutical and predictive medicine businesses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and share based payment expense 
revenue recognition 
predictive medicine revenues include revenues from the sale of predictive medicine products  forensic dna analysis fees  and related marketing agreements 
predictive medicine revenue is recognized upon completion of the test or analysis and communication of results and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
up front payments related to marketing agreements are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
research revenues include revenues from research agreements  milestone payments  and technology licensing agreements 
in applying the principles of sab to research and technology license agreements we consider the terms and conditions of each agreement separately to arrive at a proportional performance methodology of recognizing revenue 
such methodologies involve recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  on a basis of costs incurred relative to the total estimated contract costs cost to cost method  or on the basis of contractually defined output measures such as units delivered 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in our cost to cost calculations as work progresses and we gain experience 
the principal costs under these agreements are for personnel expenses to conduct research and development but also include costs for materials and other direct and indirect items necessary to complete the research under these agreements 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
payments received on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings and have been recorded as other receivables or deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved and where the 
table of contents amount of the milestone payments approximates the value of achieving the milestone 
we recognize revenue from up front nonrefundable license fees on a straight line basis over the period of our continued involvement in the research and development project 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our predictive medicine products 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment term changes when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debt 
share based payment expense 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment statement r and staff accounting bulletin no 
set accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires us to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the grant date fair value of our stock options and other equity based compensation 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board statement issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
fin accounting for income tax uncertainties 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
fin provides guidance on the de recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the provisions of eitf become effective as of december  our adoption of etif is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
table of contents results of operations years ended june  and predictive medicine revenue is comprised primarily of sales of predictive medicine products  and also includes some marketing fees and forensic dna analysis fees 
predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of

research revenue is comprised of research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements and amortization of upfront technology license fees 
research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in research revenue is primarily attributable to revenues associated with the delivery of research data pursuant to one research collaboration 
we expect that our continued focus will be on our internal drug development and predictive medicine programs and we plan to continue to de emphasize external research collaborations 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  research revenue may increase or decrease proportionately

years ended june  and predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
increased sales and marketing efforts  coupled with recent publications concerning the clinical utility of our products  have resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance that predictive medicine revenues will continue to increase at historical rates 
total research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
related party research revenue included in total research revenues for the fiscal year ended june  and was and million  respectively 
related party research revenue is comprised of certain research services performed for prolexys pharmaceuticals  inc  which was owned by us at june  the agreement to provide these research services was terminated effective january  the decrease in total research revenue is primarily attributable to the successful completion of two of our research collaborations with corporate partners

all forward looking statements are management s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward looking statements 
these risks include  but are not limited to our inability to further identify  develop and achieve commercial success for new products and technologies  our ability to discover drugs that are safer and more efficacious than our competitors  our ability to develop predictive medicine products that help assess which patients are subject to greater risk of developing diseases and who would therefore benefit from new preventive therapies  the possibility of delays in the research and development necessary 
table of contents to select drug development candidates and delays in clinical trials  the risk that clinical trials may not result in marketable products  the risk that we may be unable to successfully finance and secure regulatory approval of and market our drug candidates  or that clinical trials will be completed on the timelines we have estimated  uncertainties about our ability to obtain new corporate collaborations and acquire new technologies on satisfactory terms  if at all  the development of competing products and services  our ability to protect our proprietary technologies  patent infringement claims  risks of new  changing and competitive technologies and regulations in the united states and internationally  and other factors discussed under the heading risk factors contained in item a of this annual report 
in light of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the results and events discussed in the forward looking statements contained in this annual report or in any document incorporated by reference might not occur 
stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our written investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june   we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements as a whole
