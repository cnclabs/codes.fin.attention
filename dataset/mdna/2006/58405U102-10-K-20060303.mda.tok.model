principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries 
investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence  but neither a controlling interest nor a majority interest in the risks or rewards of the investee  are accounted for using the equity method 
the company s equity investments are not significant 
intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash includes currency on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions 
cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
as a result of the company s normal payment cycle  cash disbursement accounts carrying negative book balances of  million and million representing outstanding checks not yet presented for payment have been reclassified to claims and other accounts payable at december  and december   respectively 
this reclassification restores balances to cash and current liabilities for checks to the company s vendors  clients and members which have not cleared 
no overdraft or unsecured short term loan exists in relation to these negative balances 
short term investments 
the company has investments in certificates of deposit and us government securities that are carried at fair value and classified as available for sale  with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of equity  net of tax 
these investments  totaling million and million as of december  and december   respectively  have maturities of less than one year and are held to satisfy the statutory capital and other requirements for the company s insurance subsidiaries 
financial instruments 
the carrying amount of cash  short term investments in marketable securities  trade accounts receivable and claims and other accounts payable approximated fair values as of december  and december  the company estimates fair market value for these assets and liabilities based on their market values or estimates of the present value of their cash flows 
the fair value of the company s senior notes was million and million at december  and december   respectively  and was estimated based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of the term loan obligations outstanding under the company s senior unsecured bank credit facility approximates its carrying value and was estimated using current interbank market prices 
the fair value of the company s obligation under its interest rate swap agreements was million and million at december  and december   respectively  and was based on quoted market prices that reflect the present values of the differences between future fixed rate payments and estimated future variable rate receipts 
the fair value of the accounts receivable financing facility approximates its market value 
see note  debt and refinancing  for additional information 
accounts receivable  net 
accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from manufacturers  clients and other payors  including patient accounts receivable 
in addition  rebates payable to clients are estimated and accrued as a reduction in accounts receivable  net  based upon the prescription drugs dispensed by the 
table of contents pharmacies in the company s retail networks  or dispensed by the company s mail order pharmacies 
when rebates due to be passed back to clients are greater than the corresponding client accounts receivable balances  the net liability is reclassified to claims and other accounts payable 
unbilled pbm receivables from manufacturers are generally billed beginning days from the end of each quarter 
unbilled pbm receivables from clients are typically billed within days based on the contractual billing schedule agreed upon with each client 
at the end of any given reporting period  unbilled pbm receivables from clients may represent up to two weeks of dispensing activity and will fluctuate at the end of a fiscal month depending on the timing of these billing cycles 
certain specialty pharmacy bills are sent to payors within two days of product shipment 
a portion of the specialty pharmacy business includes reimbursement by payors  such as insurance companies  under a medical benefit  or by medicare or medicaid 
these transactions involve higher patient co payments than experienced in the pbm business 
as a result  this portion of the specialty pharmacy business  which yields a higher margin than the pbm business  experiences slower accounts receivable turnover than in the aforementioned pbm cycle 
as of december  and december   respectively  total unbilled client  other payor and manufacturer receivables amounted to  million and  million 
specialty pharmacy accounts receivable from payors and patients amounted to million at december  accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances of million at december  which includes million for specialty pharmacy and million at december  the relatively higher allowance for certain specialty pharmacy accounts reflects a different credit risk profile than the pbm business  characterized by reimbursement through medical coverage  including government agencies  and higher patient co payments 
the company regularly reviews and analyzes the adequacy of the allowances based on a variety of factors  including the age of the outstanding receivable and the collection history 
when circumstances related to specific collection patterns change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted 
concentrations of risks 
in  the company had one client that represented of net revenues  which is substantially reported within the pbm segment 
in each of and  this client represented of net revenues 
none of the company s other clients individually represented more than of net revenues in  or the company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable  which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies  insurance companies and private patients 
concentration of credit risk relating to these accounts receivable is limited to some extent by the diversity and number of patients and payors 
the company derives a substantial portion of its specialty segment revenue from the sale of specialty drugs provided by a limited number of single source biopharmaceutical manufacturers 
inventories  net 
inventories  net  are located in the company s mail order pharmacies and in warehouses  consist solely of finished product primarily prescription drugs  and are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
property and equipment  net 
property and equipment  net  is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method for assets with useful lives ranging from three to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over three to five years 
costs for general and administrative expenses  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to the existing system  are expensed as incurred 
net revenues 
product net revenues consist principally of sales of prescription drugs to clients and members  either through the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or through the company s mail order pharmacies 
specialty pharmacy product net revenues represent revenues from the sale of primarily biopharmaceutical drugs and are reported at the net amount billed to third party payors  patients and others 
the company recognizes these revenues when the prescriptions are dispensed through retail pharmacies in the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order pharmacies and received by the members and patients 
the company evaluates client contracts using the indicators of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent  to determine whether the company acts as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through the retail pharmacy network 
the company acts as a principal in most of its 
table of contents transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  including the portion of the price allocated by the client to be settled directly by the member co payment  as well as the company s administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because the company a has separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b is responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through its claims adjudication process  c commits to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manages the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are members of clients plans  and e has credit risk for the price due from the client 
in limited instances where the company adjudicates prescriptions at pharmacies that are under contract directly with the client and there are no financial risks to the company  such revenue is recorded at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the company for processing the claim net reporting 
rebates and guarantees regarding the level of service the company will provide to the client or member or the minimum level of rebates or discounts the client will receive are deducted from product net revenue as they are earned by the client 
rebates are generally paid to clients subsequent to collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers  although there are certain instances where rebates are paid to clients on a more accelerated basis 
other contractual payments made to clients are generally made upon initiation of contracts as implementation allowances  which may  for example  be designated by clients as funding for their costs to transition their plans to the company or as compensation for certain information or licensing rights granted by the client to the company 
the company considers these payments to be an integral part of the company s pricing of a contract and believes that they represent only a variability in the timing of cash flows that does not change the underlying economics of the contract 
accordingly  these payments are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of product net revenue  generally on a straight line basis  over the life of the contract where the payments are refundable upon cancellation of the contract or relate to noncancelable contracts 
amounts capitalized are assessed periodically for recoverability based on the profitability of the contract 
service revenues consist principally of administrative fees and clinical program fees earned from clients and other non product related revenues  sales of prescription services and data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and other parties  and performance oriented fees paid by specialty pharmacy manufacturers 
client administrative fees are earned for services that are comprised of claims processing  eligibility management  benefits management  pharmacy network management and other related customer services 
service revenues are recorded by the company when performance occurs and collectibility is assured 
cost of revenues 
cost of product net revenues includes the cost of inventory dispensed from the mail order pharmacies  along with direct dispensing costs and associated depreciation 
cost of product net revenues also includes ingredient costs of drugs dispensed by and professional fees paid to retail network pharmacies 
in addition  cost of product net revenues includes the operating costs of the company s call center pharmacies  which primarily respond to member and retail pharmacist inquiries regarding member prescriptions  as well as physician calls 
cost of product net revenues also includes an offsetting credit for rebates earned from pharmaceutical manufacturers whose drugs are included on the company s preferred drug lists  which are also known as formularies 
these rebates generally take the form of formulary rebates  which are earned based on the volume of a specific drug dispensed under formularies  and market share rebates  which are based on the achievement of contractually specified market share levels for a specific drug 
rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are accrued in the period earned by multiplying estimated rebatable prescription drugs dispensed through the company s retail network and through the company s mail order pharmacies by the contractually agreed manufacturer rebate amount 
rebates receivable estimates are revised to actual  with the difference recorded to cost of revenues  upon billing to the manufacturer  generally to days subsequent to the end of the applicable quarter 
these billings are not issued until the necessary specific eligible claims and third party market share data is received and thoroughly analyzed 
historically  the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized and recorded to actual amounts billed has not been material to the company s results of operations 
cost of service revenues consists principally of labor and operating costs for delivery of services provided  costs associated with member communication materials  and certain information acquisition costs 
goodwill 
goodwill of  million at december  and  million at december  represents  for the pbm business  the push down of the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the company s net assets 
table of contents from the acquisition of the company by merck in  and  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of provantage health services  inc provantage  in the balance at december  also includes a portion of the excess of the accredo purchase price over tangible net assets acquired  which has been allocated to goodwill and  to a significantly lesser extent  the acquisition of selected assets of pediatric services of america  inc pediatric services in november see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information 
the company tests its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events  such as a protracted decline in the company s stock price or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  using a two step fair value based test 
the most recent assessment of goodwill impairment for each of the designated reporting units was performed as of september   and the recorded goodwill was determined not to be impaired 
intangible assets  net 
intangible assets  net  of  million at december  and  million at december   net of accumulated amortization of  million at december  and  million at december  primarily reflect  for the pbm business  the value of client relationships that arose in connection with the acquisition of the company by merck in and that have been pushed down to the consolidated balance sheets of the company 
the balance at december  also includes the portion of the excess of the accredo purchase price over tangible net assets acquired that has been allocated to intangible assets 
see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information 
these intangible assets are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events  such as losses of significant clients or biotechnology manufacturer contracts  or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when these events occur  the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the pre tax undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings 
if this comparison indicates that there is an impairment  the amount of the impairment would be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
the company continually assesses the useful lives of the intangible assets  taking into account historical client turnover experience  including recent losses of clients and expected future losses  to ensure they reflect current circumstances 
effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year  the weighted average useful life was revised from years to years  with the annual intangible asset amortization expense increasing to million from million in effective as of the accredo acquisition on august   the weighted average useful life of intangible assets subject to amortization is years in total and by major asset class are approximately years for the pbm client relationships and approximately years for the accredo intangibles  with the annual intangible amortization expense increasing to million 
stock based compensation 
the company grants options to employees to purchase shares of medco common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant 
the options generally vest over three years and expire within years from the date of the grant 
under the terms of the medco health solutions  inc  stock incentive plan  as of december   million shares of the company s common stock are available for awards under the plan 
as of december   under the terms of the accredo health long term incentive plan as amended and restated on august   there are million shares of the company s common stock available for awards under the plan 
prior to the spin off from merck  the company s employees had participated in merck stock option plans under which employees were granted options to purchase shares of merck common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant 
these options generally were exercisable in three to five years and expired within five to years from the date of grant 
certain merck stock options granted in and converted to medco options upon the spin off the converted options 
the rate of conversion was determined based on a formula that preserved the economic position of the option holder immediately before and after the spin off

revised  share based payment sfas r which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb  and its related implementation guidance 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option on the date of grant 
because employee stock options are granted to purchase shares of stock at the fair market value on the date of grant  no compensation expense has been recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income for any stock options granted  or shares issued under the espp 

table of contents if the fair value method of accounting had been applied for stock options and shares issued under the espp  net income in  and would have been reduced 
the fair value method under sfas requires recognition of compensation expense ratably over the vesting period 
in january  the company revised the assumptions utilized by the black scholes model in determining pro forma compensation expense  based on updated option exercise data  such that the expense is attributed under the method prescribed in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin as this was considered the preferred method before final issuance of sfas r 
as a result  beginning in january  the company has calculated pro forma compensation expense for any stock options granted since that time using the fin methodology 
the company recognizes pro forma compensation expense under the straight line method of amortization for stock options granted prior to january the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value method for recognizing employee stock based compensation to stock options and for shares issued under the espp and the espp is as follows in millions  except for per share data fiscal years net income  as reported medco stock based compensation expense  net of tax pro forma net income including medco stock based compensation expense merck stock based compensation expense  net of tax pro forma net income including all stock based compensation expense basic earnings per share as reported pro forma sfas diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma sfas notes week fiscal year

the company grants restricted stock units and restricted stock to employees and directors  generally vesting over two or three years 
the company records unearned compensation within stockholders equity at an amount equivalent to the market value on the date of grant and amortizes such amount to compensation expense over the vesting period 
net income  as reported  includes stock based compensation expense related to the restricted stock units and restricted stock for the year ended december  of million million pre tax and for the year ended december  of million million pre tax and for the year ended december   million million pre tax 
at december   the net unearned compensation recorded within stockholders equity is million

for the year ended december   the medco pro forma stock based compensation expense  determined using the fair value method for stock based awards  net of tax  includes million million pre tax for the stock options and million million pre tax for the espp 
the company is reflecting the merck stock based compensation for its employees in the pro forma net income for the periods the company was wholly owned by merck 
upon spin off from merck  the company s employees had no remaining service requirements to merck and the merck stock options became fully vested  with the compensation expense of million reflecting the accelerated vesting 
there has been no impact on the company s post spin off pro forma earnings  nor will there be any impact on future pro forma earnings relating to the merck options 

table of contents the fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model

the weighted average fair value of options granted for the years ended december   december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the historical merck assumptions relate to merck stock and were therefore based on merck s valuation assumptions

income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
prior to the date of its incorporation on may   the company was structured as a single member limited liability company with merck as the sole member 
as described further in note  taxes on income  under the terms of the tax responsibility allocation agreement  the company is responsible for the payment of federal income taxes and all state income taxes on income earned subsequent to the date of the spin off  except that the company is also generally responsible for state income taxes on income earned subsequent to the date of incorporation in states where merck did not file a unitary or combined return 
these federal and state income tax liabilities are reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
use of estimates 
the consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
estimates are used in determining such items as accruals for rebates receivable and payable  depreciable useful lives  allowance doubtful accounts  testing for impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions  amounts recorded for contingencies  and other reserves 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
operating segments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  the company has two reportable segments  pbm and specialty pharmacy 
see note  segment reporting  for more information 
both the pbm and specialty pharmacy segments operate in one geographic region  which includes the united states and puerto rico 
earnings per share 
the company reports earnings per share eps in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas 
basic eps are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during the reporting period 
diluted eps are calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period 
the dilutive effect of outstanding options  and their equivalents  as well as restricted stock units  is reflected in diluted eps by application of the treasury 
table of contents stock method 
from february  to june   merck granted under its employee stock options plans  options that converted into million medco options on august  the rate of conversion was determined based on a formula that preserved the economic position of the option holder immediately before and after the spin off 
for purposes of calculating fiscal year diluted eps  the converted options were assumed to have converted to medco options on their original date of grant 
subsequent to the spin off in august  the company granted options of million shares in fiscal  million shares in fiscal and million shares in fiscal  inclusive of million shares as the result of the conversion of the accredo options outstanding  at the fair market value on the date of grant 
these options may have a dilutive effect on future eps if the exercise price of the options is less than the market price during a future reporting period 
options granted by merck to medco employees prior to february  remain options to purchase merck stock and became fully vested upon the spin off 
these merck options have no impact on medco share dilution 
for the years ended december   december  and december   there were outstanding options to purchase million  million and million shares of medco stock  respectively  where the exercise price of the options exceeded the average stock price  which is calculated as the average of the nyse price for each trading day in the fiscal period 
accordingly  these options are excluded from the diluted eps calculations 
the following is a reconciliation of the number of weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted eps calculation amounts in millions fiscal years weighted average shares outstanding dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding stock options and restricted stock units weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution other comprehensive income loss 
total comprehensive income includes  in addition to net income  unrealized investment gains and losses and changes in the minimum pension liability excluded from the consolidated statements of income that were recorded directly into a separate section of stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
these items are referred to as accumulated other comprehensive income 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is based on assumptions used by actuaries including an appropriate discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
see note  pension and other postretirement benefits  for more information concerning the company s pension and other postretirement benefits assumptions 
contingencies 
the company is currently involved in various legal proceedings and other disputes with third parties that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
the company has considered these proceedings and disputes in determining the necessity of any reserves for losses that are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company s recorded reserves are based on estimates developed with consideration given to the potential merits of claims  the range of possible settlements  advice from outside counsel  and management s strategy with regard to the settlement of such claims or defense against such claims

pension plan assets 
the company s pension plan asset allocation at december   december  and target allocation for by asset category are as follows percentage of plan assets at asset category target allocation december  december  us equity securities international equity securities fixed income total includes cash 
the investment objectives of the company s qualified pension plan are designed to generate asset returns that will enable the plan to meet its future benefit obligations 
the precise amount for which these obligations will be settled depends on future events  including interest rates  salary increases  and the life expectancy of the plan s members 
the obligations are estimated using actuarial assumptions  based on the current economic environment 
the pension plan seeks to achieve total returns both sufficient to meet expected future obligations  as well as returns greater than its policy benchmark reflecting the target weights of the asset classes used in its targeted strategic asset allocation 
the plan s targeted strategic allocation to each asset class was determined through an asset liability modeling study 
the currently adopted strategic asset allocation targets in equity securities and in fixed income and diversification within specific asset classes of these broad categories 
the company believes that the portfolio s equity weighting strategy is consistent with investment goals and risk management practices applicable to the long term nature of the plan s benefit obligation 
changes in plan assets and projected benefit obligation 
summarized information about the changes in plan assets and projected benefit obligation is as follows in millions pension benefits other postretirement benefits fiscal years fair value of plan assets at beginning of year actual return on plan assets company contributions employee contributions benefits paid fair value of plan assets at end of year projected benefit obligation at beginning of year service cost interest cost employee contributions actuarial gains losses benefits paid projected benefit obligation at end of year 
table of contents a reconciliation of the plans funded status to the net asset liability recognized at year end and is as follows in millions pension benefits other postretirement benefits plan assets in excess of less than benefit obligation unrecognized net loss unrecognized prior service benefit net asset liability recognized as other current assets other current liabilities other noncurrent liabilities net asset liability the accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was million and million at december  and december   respectively  and the projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the projected benefit obligation amounts are higher because they include projected future salary increases through expected retirement 
unrecognized net loss gain amounts reflect experience differentials relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets  differences between expected and actual healthcare cost increases  and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
expected returns are based on the market value of assets 
total unrecognized net loss gain amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other postretirement benefit costs over the average remaining service life of employees 
actuarial assumptions 
actuarial weighted average assumptions used in determining plan information are as follows pension benefits other postretirement benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at fiscal year end discount rate salary growth rate weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost for the fiscal year ended discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets salary growth rate the company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis 
for  the company maintained its expected long term rate of return on plan assets of for pension benefits  and at december   changed its discount rates for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits from to to reflect the prevailing market interest rate environment 
the discount rate assumption is determined by considering a portfolio of high quality corporate bond investments that would provide the future cash flows needed to settle benefit obligations as they came due 
the expected rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on the plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers long term compound annualized returns of historical market data  as well as historical actual returns on the company s plan assets 
using this reference information  the company develops forward looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long term rate of return for a targeted portfolio allocated across these investment categories 
actuarial assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
a reasonably possible change of plus minus basis points in the discount rate assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on net pension and postretirement benefit cost 
a reasonably possible change of plus minus basis points in the expected rate of return assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on net pension cost 

table of contents the amended postretirement benefit healthcare plan resulted in future costs being capped based on costs 
as a result  employer liability is not affected by healthcare cost trend after the company will have a minimum pension funding requirement of million under the internal revenue code irc during the preceding hypothetical changes in discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the company s funding requirements 
cash flows employer contributions 
the company expects to contribute an additional amount up to million to its pension plans above the aforementioned minimum pension funding requirement 
the expected contributions to the pension plans during are estimated to reflect amounts necessary to satisfy minimum funding requirements or medco s discretion in bringing the plans to a fully funded accumulated benefit obligation status 
the company anticipates that contributions will consist solely of cash 
estimated future benefit payments 
the following benefit payments  which reflect expected future service  as appropriate  are expected to be paid in millions fiscal years pension benefits other postretirement benefits other plans 
the company participates in a multi employer defined benefit retirement plan that covers certain union employees 
the company made contributions to the plan of million in  million in and million in the company sponsors defined contribution retirement plans for all eligible employees  as defined in the plan documents 
these plans are qualified under section k of the irc 
contributions to the plans are based on employee contributions and a company matching contribution 
the company s matching contributions to the plans were million in  million in and million in taxes on income the components of the provision for income taxes are as follows in millions fiscal years current provision federal state total deferred provision benefit federal state total total provision for income taxes 
table of contents a reconciliation between the company s effective tax rate and the us statutory rate is as follows fiscal years us statutory rate applied to pretax income differential arising from state taxes other effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective rate for the year reflects a million non recurring benefit recorded in the third quarter of associated with a reduction in the company s marginal state income tax rate resulting primarily from an enacted change in a state income tax law and the receipt of a favorable state income tax ruling 
a reduction in the company s marginal state income tax rate creates a benefit via a corresponding reduction of the company s net deferred tax liabilities  principally on its net intangible assets  partially offset by deferred tax assets primarily from client rebates payable and other accruals 
during  the company completed a study of its state tax position for the apportionment of its income  based on its business activities and tax strategies existing as of the spin off date from merck 
the study included formalization during the second quarter of its state income tax position through rulings from and discussions with taxing authorities in key selected states 
as a result of the outcome of the study  the company has determined that its income taxes as a stand alone taxpayer should be provided at a lower effective rate than the rate it used as a member of the merck consolidated group 
for all periods presented  the company s consolidated balance sheets reflect a net deferred tax liability  which arises from its deferred tax liabilities  principally on its intangible assets being only partially offset by its deferred tax assets  principally on client rebates payable and other accruals 
accordingly  a reduction in the company s effective tax rate results in a benefit from the reduction of that net deferred tax liability 
as a result of the study  the company expects to settle its net deferred tax liability as a stand alone taxpayer at an effective rate lower than it expected to settle as a member of the merck consolidated group 
accordingly  the company in the second quarter of reduced its net deferred tax liability existing as of the spin off date  and recorded the benefit as a million credit to additional paid in capital 
the company also adjusted its net deferred tax liability in the second quarter of for temporary differences arising since the spin off through income tax expense  the impact of which was not material 
in addition  and largely as a result of state filing positions available as a stand alone taxpayer as opposed to filing as a member of the merck consolidated group  the company expects to achieve additional state income tax savings some of which relate to state income tax payables provided for at the spin off date from merck 
to the extent that these state tax savings are realized  they will be recorded as a reduction of state income taxes at the time approval is received from the respective state taxing jurisdiction or the applicable statute of limitation has expired 
deferred income taxes at year end consisted of in millions assets liabilities assets liabilities intangibles accelerated depreciation accrued expenses accrued rebates other total deferred taxes income taxes payable of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  are reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities

segment reporting reportable segments as a result of the company s acquisition of accredo  the company now has two reportable segments  pbm and specialty pharmacy 
the pbm segment involves sales of traditional prescription drugs to the company s clients and their members  either through the company s network of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order 
table of contents pharmacies 
the specialty pharmacy segment  which was formed upon the accredo acquisition  includes the sale of higher margin specialty pharmacy products and services for the treatment of chronic and potentially life threatening diseases 
the results of accredo are included in the specialty pharmacy segment results and the consolidated statements of income effective with the august  acquisition 
the specialty pharmacy segment also includes the specialty pharmacy activity previously included in medco s pbm business 
the company defines the specialty pharmacy segment based on a product set and associated services  broadly characterized to include drugs that are high cost  usually developed by biotechnology companies and often injectable  and which require elevated patient support 
when dispensed  these products frequently require a significant amount of ancillary administration equipment  special packaging  and a much higher level of patient oriented customer service than is normally required in the pbm business model 
in addition  specialty pharmacy products and services are often covered through medical benefit programs with the primary payors being insurance companies and government programs  along with patients  with a smaller but growing percentage of pbm clients as payors 
factors used to identify reportable segments the specialty pharmacy segment was formed as a result of the accredo acquisition on august  in response to a management desire to manage the acquired business together with medco s pre existing specialty pharmacy activity as a separate business from medco s pbm operations 
this acquisition complimented the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy operations  which was evolving in and  to a greater extent in results for the specialty pharmacy business were neither prepared nor provided to the chief operating decision maker as he managed medco on an entity level 
during  medco established procedures and controls and implemented system solutions in order to identify discrete financial information on a prospective basis for the specialty pharmacy activities in anticipation of the combination of those activities with accredo into a separate segment  effective with the closing of the accredo acquisition 
until these procedures  controls and systems were implemented during  the complexity of the company s manufacturer and client contracts  determining the appropriate cost of inventory and retail reimbursement  as well as the shared costs between the pbm and specialty pharmacy activities prevent medco from preparing detailed separate profitability financial results for specialty pharmacy for periods prior to the formation of the segment in august of for fiscal years  and  medco has identified the revenues associated with the specialty pharmacy business based on a data extract of sales for the specialty product set 
medco has also calculated the estimated full year operating income for fiscal year based on the best information available for the pre acquisition period and the detailed post acquisition segment results 
in estimating the and operating income  medco utilized the overall pbm operating income as a percentage to revenue 
the and operating income estimates for the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy operations approximate the overall pbm operating income as a percentage to revenue as the product pricing and service model was substantially consistent with the overall pbm business in those periods 
selected segment income and asset information total net revenues and operating income are the measures used by the chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of each of the company s operating segments 
as described above  the company s acquisition of accredo resulted in the establishment of the specialty pharmacy segment  hence the specialty pharmacy segment activity commenced with the accredo acquisition date 
the following table presents selected financial information about the company s reportable segments  including a reconciliation of operating income to income before provision for income taxes in millions for the year ended december  pbm specialty pharmacy total product net revenues total service revenues total net revenues total cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles operating income reconciling items to income before provision for income taxes interest and other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes total identifiable assets capital expenditures notes includes eight fiscal months of specialty pharmacy activity previously included in medco s pbm business

if the company had owned accredo for the full fiscal year ended december   it is estimated that the specialty pharmacy segment net revenues would represent approximately of total medco net revenues 
medco s operating results for fiscal  excluding the effect of the accredo acquisition  would have reflected  million in net revenues  and million in operating income

pcma appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit and  on november   the court of appeals affirmed the district court s ruling 
pcma plans to petition the united states supreme court to review the case 
if the supreme court declines to review the case or the judgment is upheld  it could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct its business on commercially reasonable terms in maine 
the company is also involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to the company s business  principally employment and commercial matters 
the various lawsuits described above arise in an environment of rising costs for prescription drugs and heightened public scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry  including the pbm and specialty pharmacy industries and their practices 
this public scrutiny is characterized by extensive press coverage  ongoing attention in various state and federal government branches  and investigations and public statements by government officials 
these factors contribute to the uncertainty regarding the possible course and outcome of the proceedings discussed above 
an adverse outcome in any one of the lawsuits described above could result in material fines and damages  changes to the company s business practices  loss of or litigation with clients  and other penalties 
moreover  an adverse outcome in any one of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  liquidity and operating results 
the company is vigorously defending each of the pending lawsuits described above 
although the range of loss for many of the unresolved matters above is not subject to reasonable estimation and it is not feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of any of the above proceedings with certainty  the company s management does not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity  either individually or in the aggregate 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate resolutions of one or more of these matters  or changes in the company s assumptions or its strategies related to these proceedings 
the company believes that most of the claims made in these legal proceedings and government investigations would not likely be covered by insurance

for the majority of the period during which the company was owned by merck  merck provided the company with various services  including finance  legal  public affairs  executive oversight  human resources  procurement and other services 
the historical consolidated financial statements for and prior years include expense allocations related to these services  which diminished as the company prepared for the spin off 
these expense allocations are reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses and amounted to million for the year to date through august  all of which was recorded in the first quarter of 
the company considers these allocations to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided 
the company assumed full responsibility for these services and the related expenses prior to the completion of the spin off 
on august   the company received million in settlement of the recorded amount of the net intercompany receivable due from merck arising from intercompany transactions from december   to july  the company completed its spin off from merck on august  as a result  the company no longer has intercompany transactions with merck  and it treats its transactions for items such as mail order inventory  sales of pbm and other services  and rebates receivable as third party transactions 
prescription drugs purchased from merck that are dispensed by the company s mail order pharmacies are included in cost of product net revenues  or in inventory if not yet dispensed 
during the periods prior to the spin off  this inventory from merck was recorded at a price that management believes approximated the price that an unrelated third party would pay 
during fiscal through the spin off date  purchases from merck as a percentage of the company s total cost of revenues remained consistently in the to range 
in addition  the company records rebates from merck in cost of revenues based on the volume of merck prescription drugs dispensed through its retail pharmacy network and by its mail order pharmacies 
the accounting treatment for the historical transactions with merck is consistent with how transactions with other third parties have been and continue to be treated

in connection with the spin off  the company also entered into a tax responsibility allocation agreement with merck 
the tax responsibility allocation agreement includes  among other items  terms for the filing and payment of income taxes through the spin off date 
for the period up to the spin off date  merck incurred federal taxes on the company s income as part of merck s consolidated tax return 
for state income taxes prior to the company s incorporation  merck was taxed on the company s income 
this is also the case for the post incorporation period through the spin off date in states where merck filed a unitary or combined tax return 
in states where merck did not file a unitary or combined tax return  the company is responsible since incorporation for filing and paying the associated taxes  with the estimated state tax liability reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
subsequent to the spin off  the company is responsible for filing its own federal and state tax returns and making the associated payments 

table of contents in addition  the company entered into an indemnification and insurance matters agreement  as well as a master separation and distribution agreement  and other related agreements

see note  subsequent event  for more information 
subsequent event on february   following arms length negotiations  the managed care agreement that the company had entered into with merck while it was a wholly owned subsidiary of merck was terminated as of april  effective april   the managed care agreement will be replaced with a new agreement that is comparable to the customary rebate agreements the company has entered into with other major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the ordinary course of our business 
the liquidated damages provisions contained in the managed care agreement  under which the company could have been required to pay liquidated damages if the company s merck related market share declined below specified levels  will no longer apply
