table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of banking services to our customers  with a primary focus on serving closely held businesses in the chicago metropolitan area and the people who own and manage them 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
all share and per share information for all periods presented has been adjusted for a three for two split of our common stock that was effected as a dividend to stockholders of record as of october  overview we reported net income applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted common share  compared with million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the increased net income applicable to common stockholders was primarily a result of higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan losses  while lower noninterest income was substantially offset by lower noninterest expense 
in addition  we had no preferred dividends in because we redeemed all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock in july net interest income increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared with the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for total assets increased by million  or  from year end to billion at december  we reported net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  for  compared to net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  for the increased net income applicable to common stockholders in was primarily a result of reduced noninterest expense and reduced preferred stock dividends 
noninterest expense declined million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to we achieved the reduction in noninterest expense through reduced salary and advertising expense as well as a lower charge relating to our facilities initiatives 
we also lowered our cost of capital by redeeming our series a preferred stock with the proceeds from junior subordinated debentures in mid total assets increased million  or  from year end to billion at december  capital transactions on august   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
on september   we issued an additional  shares in connection with an over allotment option granted to our underwriters 
we received million  after offering expenses  from this offering 
the offering helped increase our tangible equity to assets ratio to at december  from at december   and has had the effect of increasing the daily trading volume of our common stock 
we used million of the proceeds to reduce notes payable and the remainder of the proceeds has been retained at the holding company to support our continued growth 
in connection with our capital stock offering  the taylor family reduced their stock holdings in the company by selling  shares of common stock in the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the taylor family 
as a result of the taylor family s sale of stock  the taylor family s ownership of the company has declined below 

table of contents on june   tayc capital trust ii  our wholly owned non consolidated subsidiary  issued million of trust preferred securities in a private placement 
tayc capital trust ii invested the proceeds  along with million received from us for the purchase of its common equity securities  in million of junior subordinated debentures issued by the company 
on july   we used the proceeds from the junior subordinated debentures to redeem all of our outstanding shares of series a noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 
the redemption price was the stated liquidation value of the series a preferred stock of per share  totaling million  plus  of accrued and unpaid dividends since the last dividend distribution date 
the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures after issuance costs and redemption of the series a preferred stock were used for general corporate purposes 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
our accounting policies are described in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
the significant uncertainties surrounding our portfolio of borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments and competitive challenges as well as management and other changes greatly complicate the estimate of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  actual losses may vary from current estimates 

table of contents as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
goodwill impairment we have goodwill of million that we recognized in connection with our acquisition of the bank 
we test this goodwill annually on july for impairment  or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we tested goodwill for impairment as of july  and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
the evaluation for impairment includes comparing the estimated fair market value of the bank to our carrying value for the bank 
because there is not a readily observable market value for the bank  the estimation of the fair market value is based on the market price of our common stock adjusted for the junior subordinated debentures and the notes payable at the holding company 
income taxes at times  we apply different tax treatment for selected transactions for tax return purposes than for income tax financial reporting purposes 
the different positions result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations  and interpretations  and our accruals for income taxes include reserves for these differences in position 
our estimate of the value of these reserves contains assumptions based upon our past experience and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  and we believe that the level of these reserves is reasonable 
a reserve is utilized or reversed once the applicable statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved 
it is likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amounts we have accrued 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate exchange and floor agreements  to assist in our interest rate risk management 
in accordance with sfas  all derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair values 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas are also reported currently in earnings 
at the inception of the hedge and quarterly thereafter  a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period and prospectively 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivative flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  which results in greater volatility in our earnings 

table of contents the estimates of fair values of our derivatives are calculated using independent valuation models to estimate mid market valuations 
the fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and therefore can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in income statement volatility 
results of operations as of and for the years ended december    and net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income earned on interest earning assets  including investment securities and loans  and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million during these non gaap tax equivalent measures are discussed more fully below 
the net interest income increased as a result of the increase in our average interest earning assets and in our net interest margin 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was during compared to during our net interest margin benefited from the increase in market interest rates that began at the end of the second quarter of the net interest margin incorporates the impact on noninterest bearing funds 
because the average volume of earning assets was million greater than the volume of interest bearing liabilities and the yield on earning assets increased during  the net interest margin increased 
the tax equivalent net interest spread  which is determined by subtracting the yield on interest earning assets from the cost of interest bearing liabilities was unchanged at during both and the yield on our interest earning assets increased basis points to during from during the cost of our interest bearing liabilities also increased basis points to during from during average interest earning assets increased million  or  to billion for compared to billion for average loans increased million  or  to billion during compared to billion for average commercial loans increased million  or  between the two periods  while our portfolio of home equity and consumer loans decreased by million  or

from to  average brokered and out of local market certificates of deposits cds increased million  or  average money market accounts increased million  or  and average local customer cds increased million  or 
deposits in noninterest bearing and lower rate products  including now and savings accounts  declined 
see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned deposits for further discussion on changes in deposits during our internal modeling indicates that if interest rates were to remain unchanged in  we would expect to be exposed to the negative impact of a significant portion of our time deposits maturing and repricing at today s higher market rates  while a large portion of our assets are floating and therefore reflect today s market rates 
this downward pressure on our net interest margin will likely be augmented by the increasing competitive pressure on loan and deposit pricing 
provided we execute our balance sheet growth and funding mix plans 
table of contents effectively  we expect our tax equivalent net interest margin to marginally decline for see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks for further discussion on the impact of changes in interest rates 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during  as compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  a decrease from the million of net interest income in net interest income decreased  as the benefit from the increase in interest earning assets was more than offset by a basis point decline in our net interest margin 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was for all of compared to for our net interest margin declined as the yield on our interest earning assets declined while our cost of interest bearing liabilities remained unchanged 
the third and fourth quarters of included the incremental interest expense of approximately  and  respectively  arising from the million of junior subordinated debentures issued in june  which increased interest expense by basis points each quarter 
average interest earning assets during increased million  or  to billion as compared to billion during an increase in average loans  primarily in our commercial portfolio  produced the increase in average earning assets 
average commercial loans increased million  or  during to billion as compared to billion during this increase was partly offset by lower consumer related loans 
a million increase in average investment securities also contributed to the increase in average earning assets 
the asset growth was funded primarily with time deposits 
total average time deposits were billion during  a million increase from average time deposits of million during higher average brokered and customer cds produced the majority of the increase 
additional funding was also provided by a million increase in average non interest bearing demand deposits 
tax equivalent measures 
as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  the earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments 
the following table reconciles the tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income as reported on the consolidated statements of income

for additional information concerning this determination  see the sections of this discussion and analysis captioned application of critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets and impaired loans and allowance for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses was million during  a decrease of million  or  less than the provision of million during the lower provision in as compared to was due to the improvement in the overall performance of our loan portfolio  as evidenced by reduced net charge offs and nonaccrual loans  coupled with the slower growth of commercial loans 
net charge offs totaled million  or of total loans  in compared to million  or of total loans  in nonaccrual loans totaled million at year end as compared to million at year end total commercial loans grew million in  compared to million in see the sections of this discussion and analysis captioned nonperforming assets and impaired loans and allowance for loan losses for further discussion on the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
our net charge offs in were at the lower range of our expectations  and we are anticipating a higher provision for loan losses in than we recorded in however  if the overall credit performance of our loan portfolio is similar and our loan portfolio continues to grow  we would expect our allowance as a percentage of total loans to decline through the end of we continue to expect our provisioning to fluctuate as the circumstances of our individual commercial borrowers and the economic environment change 

table of contents our provision of million during was  or  higher than the provision for loan losses of million during the increase in the provision was mainly due to the growth in commercial loans

service charges declined to million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
service charge income is impacted by a number of factors  including the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
the decrease in service charge revenue in and was primarily caused by a lower volume of deposit services rendered and an increase in the earnings credit rate given to customers on their collected account balances to offset gross activity charges 
trust services include fees from corporate trust  land trust and tax deferred exchange trust services 
total trust fees decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in the decline in trust fees was primarily a result of the sale of the land trust operations at the end of the first quarter of for a gain of million 
in  land trust revenues totaled million 
on october   we entered into a strategic alliance with a company that provides tax deferred exchange services whereby all four of our tax deferred exchange professionals became employees of that company and we became the primary financial custodian for that company in the midwest region

this sale allows us to redeploy our investment in that banking facility into geographic markets more closely aligned with our targeted customers 
loan syndication fees increased million to million during as compared to million during and million during these fees were earned through the syndication of certain commercial real estate development loans for our customers 
while professional real estate developers have for years been a significant part of our commercial banking business  our activity in loan syndication has been opportunistic 
while fees of this nature are difficult to predict with certainty  we anticipate fees to approximate and levels 
atm fees have declined since as the number of automatic teller machines we have deployed in our market has decreased 
we have investments in limited partnerships that specialize in providing low income housing in the chicago metropolitan area 
as our ownership percentage in these partnerships are typically small  we account for our investments under the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of partnership losses in noninterest income and the related low income housing tax credits as a reduction of income tax expense 
at december   we had investments in a total of partnerships with a carrying value of million 
we use certain interest rate exchange agreements  or swaps  to convert fixed rate brokered cds to a variable rate 
to the extent these agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the net cash settlements are reported in noninterest income 
net cash settlements were  in  as compared to million in the increase in market interest rates that began in mid caused the decrease in the net cash settlements as the rates paid on the variable leg of the swaps increased

salaries and employee benefits represent the largest category of our noninterest expense 
total salaries and benefits during were compared to million during and million during changes in the composition of salaries and employee benefits were as follows salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance were million  million and million during  and respectively

stock based compensation expense  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  will be recognized against earnings for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated using a black scholes pricing model under sfas for pro forma disclosure 
the company is currently evaluating to what extent the entity s equity instruments will be used in the future for employees services and the transition provisions of this standard  therefore  the full impact to the company s financial statements of the adoption of sfas no

our occupancy of premises expense was million during as compared to million during and million during the decrease of  or  during as compared to was due to reduced premises maintenance and janitorial services as we continued to reduce our ownership of facilities 
the increase of  or during as compared to was due to higher rent expense partly offset by a decline in depreciation of building related improvements 
our occupancy expense has been impacted by our initiative to rationalize our occupancy space and consolidate our administrative and operating departments 
since  we have consolidated our administrative and operating departments in our new corporate center in rosemont  illinois  modified our banking center profile  sold certain banking centers  and opened smaller leased locations 
see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned financial condition non earning assets for additional details 
furniture and equipment expense was million during and compared to million during the increase in expense during as compared to resulted from additional depreciation from the new furniture and equipment acquired in the fourth quarter of with the corporate center consolidation 
in connection with the corporate center consolidation  we abandoned our administrative offices on the second and third floors of our wheeling facility  a  square foot facility 
upon ceasing to use this space in  we recorded a million lease abandonment charge 
the charge was comprised of a  write off of leasehold improvements  furniture and other equipment that were abandoned and a million charge for the liability related to the operating lease that represented the estimated liability for the lease payments that we would incur for the remaining term of the lease for which we would receive no future economic benefit other than through subleasing 
at the end of  we reached an agreement to terminate the lease for a cash payment of million and the transfer of a small parcel of land we owned next to the site

the decline in expense during  as compared to resulted from lower legal fees incurred in our special asset loan work out area 
improved overall credit performance in our loan portfolio has a positive impact on legal collection expenses 
in addition to the decrease in gross expense  we were able to obtain more in reimbursements from these borrowers than in prior years 
our advertising expenses were  during compared to million during and million during our advertising expense declined over these years as we discontinued television advertising and reduced print advertising 
we do  however  plan to increase our advertising and marketing activities in to increase recognition of the bank and its offering of products and services 
we expect that advertising and marketing expense will increase gradually over the next few years to be roughly of total noninterest expense annually 
consulting expense was   and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the higher expense during as compared to was related to branding and cash management product consulting 
the higher expense in was due to projects related to strategic and facilities planning  and local market analysis consultation 
other real estate and repossessed asset expense was  for the year ended december   compared to expense of  and  for and  respectively 
the higher expense during was associated with higher losses on the disposal of owned real estate properties 
this net expense is influenced to a large degree by the number and complexity of properties being maintained pending their sale 
other noninterest expense principally includes certain professional fees  fdic insurance  outside services  operating losses and other operating expenses such as telephone  postage  office supplies  and printing 
other noninterest expense was million during compared to million and million during and  respectively 
other noninterest expense in and included recoveries or charges of  and  respectively  to adjust our reserves for interest receivable related to our portfolio of indirect manufactured homes 
there were no such recoveries or charges in our efficiency ratio improved to for as compared to and for and  respectively  primarily as a result of major initiatives we have executed to reduce our operating expenses 
we expect to maintain or marginally improve our efficiency ratio in future periods 
income taxes our income tax expense was million during  resulting in an effective tax rate of  compared to our income tax expense of million during  or an effective income tax rate of 
the higher level of pre tax income caused the increase in income tax expense during income tax expense in was million  or an effective tax rate of 
the lower effective tax rates in and resulted primarily from the net recognition of million and million of income tax benefits  respectively  relating to expenses deducted on prior years tax returns for which the statute of limitations has expired 
in comparison  in  we had net additions to our income tax reserves of  without the recognition of these income tax benefits  the effective income tax rates would have been and for and  respectively 

table of contents one of our goals is to identify and potentially implement strategies to lower our effective income tax rate in the future 
the company has not recognized any income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes with respect to the litigation settlement payment of million paid in october however  the company did deduct a portion of the settlement million on its income tax return  because management believes that a portion of the settlement that relates to specific settled claims is more likely than not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expense 
this degree of certainty is not sufficient to recognize an income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes 
the company will recognize all or a portion of the income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes if and when the company determines that the position it took on its income tax return becomes probable of being sustained by the taxing authorities 
given the complexity of the litigation  the settlement and related tax law  management continues to believe that only a specific resolution of the matter with the taxing authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations would provide sufficient evidence for management to conclude that the deductibility is probable 
while the statute of limitations for the tax return expires in september  the internal revenue service can request an extension of the statute of limitations at any time prior to that date 
accrued interest  taxes and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december  include million representing the tax benefit of the deduction of million and million of related accrued interest through such date  if the deduction were disallowed by the taxing authorities 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
financial condition our total assets increased million  or  during to billion at december  compared to billion at year end an increase in loans and investment securities primarily produced the increase 
total deposits increased million  or  to reach billion at december  as compared to total deposits of billion at december  total stockholders equity increased million during to million at december  compared to million at december  the sale of million shares of common stock in coupled with the retention of earnings produced the increase in total stockholders equity 
average interest earning assets during totaled billion  an increase of million  or  as compared to average interest earning assets of billion during a million increase in total average loans and a million increase in average investment securities produced the increase in average interest earning assets 
average interest bearing deposits during increased million to billion as compared to billion during  while average other borrowings increased million to million over the same time period 
interest bearing cash equivalents interest bearing cash equivalents consist of interest bearing deposits with banks or other financial institutions  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell with original maturities less than days 
all federal funds are sold overnight with daily settlement required 
we use short term investments in circumstances where a large depositor indicates the increase in deposit balance is likely to be short term 
included in interest bearing cash equivalents at december   were million of securities purchased on december  under agreements to resell on january   to accommodate a large  short term deposit 

table of contents investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to provide a source of income with minimal risk of loss  a source of liquidity and interest rate risk management opportunities 
in managing our investment portfolio within the composition of the entire balance sheet  we balance our earnings  credit  interest rate risk  and liquidity considerations  with a goal of maximizing longer term overall profitability 
the following tables present the composition and maturities of our investment portfolio by major category as of the dates indicated available for sale held to maturity total amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands december  us government agency securities collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities state and municipal obligations other debt securities total december  us government agency securities collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities state and municipal obligations other debt securities total december  us government agency securities collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities state and municipal obligations other debt securities total investment securities do not include investments in federal home loan bank fhlb and federal reserve bank stock of million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
these investments are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
we consider our commercial loan portfolio to be our primary earning asset and use our investment portfolio primarily for liquidity and interest rate risk management 
our investment portfolio increased by million  or  to million at december  compared to million at year end during  we purchased approximately million in securities to replace maturities  sales and other cash flows from our existing securities portfolio 
in addition  beginning in september  we purchased million in securities as part of an interest rate risk management strategy to reduce potential exposure to declining interest rates 
we completed the implementation of this strategy with the purchase of million of additional municipal securities in january securities purchased in included million of us government agency securities  million of mortgage related securities and million of tax exempt municipal securities 
the mortgage related securities were purchased at discounts to par and had an average life of approximately years 
the tax exempt municipal securities had average lives to the par call date of years 
the weighted average life of the investment portfolio at december  was approximately five years as compared to four years at the end of in connection with our liquidity risk management  we regularly assess the size of our investment portfolio to meet our liquidity needs 
see the sections of this discussion and analysis captioned liquidity and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks for further discussion on liquidity and interest rate risk management 

table of contents the net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio was million at the end of compared to an unrealized loss of million at the end of the decline in the fair value of the portfolio was due to changes in market interest rates and not credit deterioration 
we manage our potential exposure to impairment within our investment securities portfolio by limiting the purchase of securities at a premium over par value and by subjecting all securities to interest rate shock testing prior to their acquisition 
no security is purchased if the result of the interest rate shock testing indicates a negative yield could result under any of the rate shocks 
in addition  we adjust premium amortization monthly based on current prepayment estimates and month rolling actual prepayment rates for all mortgage related securities 
at december   we had investment securities in an unrealized loss position 
of these securities  securities have been in a loss position for twelve months or more 
we believe that none of these unrealized losses represented other than temporary impairments of our investment portfolio 
we believe that we have both the intent and ability to hold all of these securities for the time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
our investment portfolio increased by million  or  to million at december  compared to million at year end we increased our investment portfolio to increase net interest income by increasing interest earning assets 
during  we sold million of available for sale investment securities at a net gain of  we sold us government agency securities with short maturities and reinvested the proceeds in both agency and mortgage backed securities with longer durations and higher yields 
we also sold approximately million of mortgage related securities with very low par values to improve the operating efficiency of our investment portfolio 
we purchased a total of million of investment securities in investment portfolio maturity and yields the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investment securities and their weighted average yields as of december  within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield total yield dollars in thousands available for sale securities us government agency securities collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities states and political subdivisions total available for sale held to maturity securities other debt securities total held to maturity total securities based on estimated fair value 
maturities of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are based on anticipated lives of the underlying mortgages  not contractual maturities 
cmo maturities are based on cash flow or payment windows derived from broker market consensus 
rates on obligations of states and political subdivisions have been adjusted to tax equivalent yields using a income tax rate 
based on amortized cost 

table of contents investments in us treasury securities and us government agency securities are generally considered to have low credit risk 
our mortgage backed securities holdings consist principally of direct pass through securities issued by the fannie mae and freddie mac 
these securities are also considered to have low credit risk  but do possess market value risk due to the prepayment risk associated with mortgage backed securities 
our cmos consist primarily of planned amortization class securities that are backed by fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
although cmos are guaranteed as to principal and interest by certain agencies  primarily fannie mae and freddie mac  they possess market risk due to the prepayment risk associated with the underlying collateral 
we generally invest in state and municipal obligations that are rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating organizations 
however  certain municipal issues  which are restricted to our local market area  are not rated and undergo the bank s standard underwriting procedures for loan transactions 
we also have investments in federal reserve bank stock and fhlb stock which are required to be maintained for various purposes 
at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities  that exceeded of stockholders equity 
although we hold securities issued by municipalities within the state of illinois that  in the aggregate  exceed of stockholders equity  none of the holdings from any individual municipal issue exceed this threshold 
investment securities with an approximate book value of million and million at december  and  respectively  were pledged to collateralize certain deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb advances  and for other purposes as required or permitted by law 
loan portfolio our primary source of income is interest on loans

table of contents and  respectively 
consumer loans have continued to decline as we discontinued origination of indirect auto and manufactured homes  de emphasized first mortgage products  and ceased acquiring home equity loans and lines from mortgage brokers 
commercial and industrial c i loans consist of loans to businesses or for business purposes that are either unsecured or secured by collateral other than the business real estate 
these loans totaled million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively and have represented between and of our total loan portfolio over the last three years 
c i loans increased million  or  during and million  or during loans secured by commercial real estate consist of commercial owner occupied properties as well as investment properties 
these loans totaled million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively and have represented approximately of our total loan portfolio over the past three years 
commercial real estate secured loans increased million  or  during and million  or during the growth in commercial real estate secured loans in and related primarily to investment and income producing properties 
commercial real estate lending has remained strong over the last two years as historically low interest rates have added to the attractiveness of real estate investments 
while commercial real estate loans have increased  the percentage of these loans to our total loan portfolio has remained at approximately to over the past three years 
at december  and  the composition of our commercial real estate secured portfolio was approximately as follows december  december  percentage of total commercial real estate secured percentage of gross loans percentage of total commercial real estate secured percentage of gross loans commercial properties non owner occupied owner occupied subtotal residential income property total commercial real estate secured real estate construction loans consist primarily of loans to professional real estate developers for the construction of single family homes  town homes  condominium conversions and commercial property

table of contents we expect that our growth rate in total commercial loans  which includes commercial and industrial  commercial real estate secured  and real estate construction  to reflect historical growth rates 
during  most of our commercial loan growth occurred in our real estate portfolios  a market that we believe has benefited from a robust real estate market and favorable interest rates 
in  we plan to focus on originating c i loans  while continuing our historically strong real estate development and investment lending 
if the real estate market in the chicago metropolitan area softens significantly above and beyond our current projections and we are unable to increase our penetration into the operating company c i market  our commercial loan growth rate could slow 
our portfolio of residential real estate mortgages continues to decline as a result of our decision to de emphasize this product in at december   this portfolio totaled million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
correspondingly  this portfolio as a percentage of total loans has decreased to at year end from at december  we expect that this portfolio of loans will continue to decline 
in  we also stopped originating residential real estate loans for sale into the secondary market 
our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit continues to decline as a result of our decision to discontinue the origination of third party sourced home equity products in at december   this portfolio totaled million  compared to million and million at december  and respectively

table of contents nonperforming assets and impaired loans lending officers and their managers are responsible for continuous review of present and estimated future performance of the loans within their assigned portfolio and for risk rating such loans in accordance with the bank s risk rating system 
in addition  an objective loan review process independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the effectiveness of the lending officer s loan risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level is reported by the responsible lending officer to a loan committee where consideration is given to placing the loan on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis for recognition of interest income when sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest 
generally  loans are to be placed on nonaccrual when principal and interest is contractually past due days  unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due days or more but still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets restructured loans not included in nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total loans plus repossessed property nonperforming assets to total assets a loan is considered impaired if  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
certain homogenous loans  including residential mortgage and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and  therefore  do not have individual credit risk ratings and are excluded from impaired loans 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans as well as certain accruing loans judged to have higher risk of noncompliance with the present contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal 
once a loan has been determined to be impaired  it is measured to establish the amount of the impairment 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  the measurement of impairment may not always result in an allowance for loan loss for every impaired loan 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 

table of contents information about the impaired loans at or for the years ended december    and is as follows in thousands recorded balance of impaired loans  at end of year with related allowance for loan loss with no related allowance for loan loss total allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans  at end of year average balance of impaired loans for the year interest income recognized on impaired loans for the year although the amount of impaired loans increased at the end of  as compared to and  the corresponding allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans  did not increase proportionately 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  in addition to the impaired loans  we continue to closely monitor the credit quality trends in the manufactured housing industry and its potential impact on our portfolio of loans secured by manufactured homes 
these trends could lead to higher net charge offs in the future 
at december   our consumer loan portfolio included million of loans to consumers secured by manufactured homes  however  we have discontinued the origination of these loans and we expect this portfolio to continue to decline over time 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial  which includes c i  commercial real estate  and real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification and in some cases by delinquency status 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  for example home equity loans over loan to value  home equity loans equal to or less than  and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  segmenting loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates for prior years for each separate loan segment identified 
each of the prior years historical loss rates is then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the segments  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 

table of contents specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the factors assessed are more qualitative in nature 
conditions affecting the entire lending portfolio evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include general economic and business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations and findings of our independent loan review process 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussion with our senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as part of the formula allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such conditions is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  the loans to which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
for example  our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 

table of contents the table below presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions

nonearning assets the company has million and million of goodwill at december  and  respectively  created from the acquisition of the bank 
goodwill was reduced by  during in connection with the sale of the land trust operations 
in recording goodwill in  the company elected the composite useful life approach and aggregated existing intangible assets into goodwill 
intangible assets consisting of relationships with land trust customers were therefore  included in the original recognition of goodwill 
in connection with the sale of the land trust operations in  the amount of the goodwill relating to land trusts was offset against the proceeds from the sale 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment and as of july   the company determined that no impairment charge was necessary at that time 
no additions or disposals to goodwill were recorded during premises  leasehold improvements  and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in premises  leasehold improvements and equipment was due to the construction of our ashland banking center  as well the remodeling of our wheeling banking center 
partially offsetting these increases was the completion in of the sale of our broadview banking center that had a net book value million 
deposits our deposits consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand deposits  savings deposits  cds  certain public funds and customer repurchase agreements 
our customer repurchase agreements are reported in other borrowings 
we also use brokered and other out of local market cds to support our asset base

on october   we entered into a strategic alliance with a tax deferred exchange company in which all four of our tax deferred exchange professionals became employees of that company and we became the primary financial custodian for that company in the midwest region 
as a result  tax deferred exchange deposits increased to million at december  from million at december  money market accounts also increased in from the introduction of a new  higher rate promotional account in the spring of our in market deposits also include deposits and other borrowings from what we describe as deposit rich customers 
these customers include title companies  downstream correspondent banks and local municipalities  among others 
within this customer group  there were two customers with combined deposit balances of million at december  on january   we completed the sale of our broadview banking center 
in addition to selling the physical land and building  we sold approximately million of deposits 
the deposits sold consisted of million of noninterest bearing demand deposits  million of interest bearing demand deposits and million of cds 
the sale of these deposits did not have a material impact on our funding 

table of contents we utilize out of market cd s to fund the portion of our earning asset growth that is not funded with in market deposits and other borrowings 
while these time deposits generally carry higher interest rates  prudent use of these alternatives is part of our strategy for the management of our overall cost of funding 
when we evaluate the rate paid on a particular in market deposit product  we quantify the cost of the increase and weigh it against the alternative of maintaining the rate and exposing ourselves to potential balance runoff  which then must be funded through alternative sources 
this in market deposit pricing strategy has been critical for us in the management of our cost of total funding 
we offer cds to out of local market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers 
these cds are generally issued at amounts of  or less as the purchasers seek to maintain full fdic deposit insurance protection 
the balance of cds obtained through this marketing medium was million at december   as compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
we also issue brokered cds 
the balance of our brokered cds was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
under fdic regulations  only well capitalized institutions may fund brokered cds without prior regulatory approval  and the bank is currently categorized as well capitalized 
adverse operating results at the bank or changes in industry conditions or overall market liquidity could lead to our inability to replace brokered deposits at maturity  which could result in higher costs to  or reduced asset levels at  the bank 
brokered cds are carried net of the related broker placement fees and fair value adjustments related to those brokered cds accounted for as fair value hedges 
the broker placement fees are amortized to the maturity date of the related brokered cds 
the amortization is included in deposit interest expense 
the fair value adjustment relates to those brokered cds that are hedged with cd swaps 
at december   the scheduled maturities of brokered cds are as follows year associated with cd swaps all others total in thousands thereafter subtotal unamortized broker placement fees fair value adjustment total we have entered into interest rate exchange contracts to change the fixed interest expense on certain brokered cds to variable 
under these contracts  we receive a fixed interest rate over the term of the agreement and pay a floating interest rate based upon month libor 
the notional amount of these interest rate exchange contracts related to brokered cds totaled million at december  one of our key goals in is to increase our deposits from our commercial customers  particularly with respect to noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts 
to achieve this goal we have revised our incentive compensation program to give more value to customer deposit accounts 
additionally  in we will be introducing cash management product enhancements including imaged lockbox and remote deposit capture 
we believe our focus on operating companies and c i lending customers will also facilitate growth in lower cost deposits 
historically  our real estate developers and investors  in aggregate  maintain deposits approximating of their aggregate loan outstandings

our other borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and us treasury tax and loan note option accounts 
the federal funds purchased are primarily noncollateralized funds obtained from financial institutions where the bank acts as one of the selling institution s primary correspondent banks 
the overnight securities sold under agreement to repurchase are collateralized financing transactions and are primarily executed with local bank customers 
at december   we had a million term repurchase agreement that we executed with a broker dealer to fund a portion of our investment security purchases during the term repurchase agreement  which matures in september  carries a variable interest rate tied to month libor with a maximum rate of

table of contents capital resources we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier i capital includes common stockholders equity  trust preferred securities up to certain limits  and  in prior periods  our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 
goodwill is deducted from tier i capital 
total capital represents tier i capital plus the allowance for loan loss  subject to certain limits  our subordinated note payable and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier i capital 
at december    and  the holding company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
the holding company s regulatory capital ratios increased in as a result of the common stock offering completed in august and from earnings retention 
the holding company s regulatory capital ratios declined in as a result of the increase in average and risk weighted assets and the redemption of the preferred stock 
during  we redeemed the million series a noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  all of which qualified as tier i capital 
the series a preferred stock was redeemed with the proceeds from the issuance of million of trust preferred securities by tayc capital trust ii on june  a portion of the trust preferred securities qualifies as tier i capital and the remainder qualifies as tier ii capital 
as a result  the redemption of the preferred stock and the issuance of the trust preferred securities caused a decline in tier i capital  but no material impact on total capital tier i and tier ii 
total capital increased in because of earnings retention 
at december    and  the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
all of the bank s capital ratios increased during  as growth in equity outpaced the higher risk weighted and average assets 
during  the bank s ratio of tier i to risk weighted assets and total capital to risk weighted assets both decreased 
the decrease was a result of higher risk weighted assets  partly offset by an increase in regulatory capital 
regulatory capital increased through earnings retention 
the bank s dividend payout as a percentage of bank net income was for the year ended december  we intend to maintain the bank s capital levels at amounts above the regulatory well capitalized guidelines

the amount of dividends paid was million in and million in and the increase in common shares outstanding because of the august public offering  as well as the exercise of stock options  caused the increase in the amount of dividends paid in during  we also declared preferred stock dividends of per share  totaling million 
we redeemed the series a preferred stock on july   and therefore no longer pay preferred dividends 
during  we declared preferred stock dividends of per share  totaling million 
as of december   we had purchased  shares of our common stock  at a cost of million  which are held as treasury shares 
previously  under the terms of our employee stock ownership plan  stock option agreements  and the restricted stock program  we were obligated to purchase shares of our stock from 
table of contents terminated employees related to put rights 
following the completion of our common stock offering  we are no longer obligated to purchase shares of our stock under any of these plans and we purchased no additional treasury shares in or liquidity in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from in market deposit growth  in concert with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  the bank utilizes brokered and out of local market cds  fhlb borrowings  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet its liquidity needs 
we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by extending and laddering the maturity of these liabilities and pledging collateral 
we manage the risk associated with volatility in our customers deposit balances by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use 
for example  the bank is able to borrow from the federal reserve bank using securities or commercial loans as collateral through the borrower in custody program 
under this program  at december   the bank maintained million of commercial loans as collateral with a lendable value of million 
the bank also maintains pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines at various correspondent banks  which provide additional short term borrowing capacity of million at december  pre approved repurchase agreement availability with major brokers and banks totaled million at december   subject to acceptable unpledged marketable securities 
at december   our total assets increased to billion  a million  or  increased from december  the increase in total assets was primarily funded with a million increase in deposits and a million increase in other borrowings 
the increase in deposits was primarily due to a million increase in money market account balances and a million increase in brokered cd balances 
cash inflow from operations exceeded cash outflows by million in we also received million of proceeds  net of issuance costs  from the offering of million of our common shares in we believe that our current sources of funds are adequate to meet all of our financial commitments and asset growth targets for during  our total assets increased by million  or 
the increase in total assets was primarily funded with the million increase in deposits 
the increase in deposits was primarily due to a million increase in brokered and out of local market cds a million increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits 
cash inflow from operations exceeded cash outflows by million in during  our total assets increased by million  or 
the asset growth was funded almost equally by wholesale deposits and cash provided by operations 
most of the increase in wholesale deposits was from higher brokered cd balances 
cash inflows from operations exceeded cash outflows by million in interest received net of interest paid was the principal source of our operating cash inflows in each of the above periods 
management of investing and financing activities and market conditions determine the level and the stability of our net interest cash flows 
our net cash outflows from investing activities for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
during  the net cash outflow was primarily invested in loans of million and investment securities of million

during  we also utilized term securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund a portion of our investing activities 
a portion of the net proceeds of million from our 
table of contents common stock offering was used to retire our subordinated and term debt totaling million 
in  we used proceeds from the issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures to tayc capital trust ii to redeem all of the outstanding series a preferred stock at its stated amount of million 
holding company liquidity 
historically  our primary source of funds has been dividends received from the bank 
during and  the bank declared million and million  respectively of dividends to the holding company 
during  the bank did not declare any dividends 
the bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth by regulatory authorities  whereby the bank may not  without prior approval of regulatory authorities  declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year s earnings plus the retained earnings from the prior two years 
the dividends  as of december   that the bank could declare and pay to us  without the approval of regulatory authorities  amounts to approximately million 
we also receive funds from the exercise of employee stock options 
we received million during each of and from the exercise of employee stock options  compared to million in in  we received net proceeds  after issuance costs  of million from the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
we used million of the proceeds to repay our notes payable 
to date we have maintained the remaining proceeds at the holding company level for general corporate purposes and to support future growth 
our liquidity uses at the holding company level consist primarily of dividends to stockholders  debt service requirements on the debentures issued to tayc capital trust i and tayc capital trust ii  and expenses for general corporate purposes 
the holding company currently has sufficient cash to meet its expected obligations in in addition  we have a million revolving credit facility  which was not drawn upon at december  in  we received net proceeds  after issuance costs  of million from the issuance of junior subordinated debentures to tayc capital trust ii 
we used most of these proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding series a preferred stock 
the redemption price was the stated value of million  plus  of accrued and unpaid dividends since the last dividend distribution date 
the remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we had commitments to extend credit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts 
historically  approximately of available consumer and commercial loan commitment amounts are drawn 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and  respectively 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees

under these cd swaps  we receive a fixed interest rate equal to the rate paid on the brokered cds and pay a variable interest rate based upon month libor 
in august  we entered into a three year swap  with a notional amount of million  to hedge the variability in cash flows on certain prime indexed commercial loans 
under the terms of this swap  we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating rate based upon the prime lending rate 
we account for this as a cash flow hedge  and the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded as an asset or liability with the corresponding gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  net of tax 
during  we entered into swaps with a total notional amount of million  to hedge the variability of cash flows of certain prime indexed commercial loans and accounted for these transactions as cash flow hedges 
however  in october  these swaps were terminated and the resulting gain on termination of  net of taxes  was deferred and recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
this deferred gain is being reclassified as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining term of the original swaps 
during each of the years ended december  and   of this deferred gain was reclassified into interest income 
during  an additional  of this deferred gain is expected to be reclassified into interest income 
during  we entered into two five year interest rate floors  each with a million notional amount 
the agreements are based upon the prime lending rate and have interest rate floors of and 
we use these interest rate floors as cash flow hedges of certain commercial loans that are tied to the prime lending rate  
table of contents to protect interest income in the event that the prime lending rate declines below the floor level 
the premium on the floors is amortized to loan interest income in proportion to the expected value of the floor  calculated at inception  in each of the future periods 
the company did not receive any payment in from these floors

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  or alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps and interest rate floors  to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts are designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative financial instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or any changes in balance sheet composition 
projected net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in the balance sheet such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
as short term interest rates increased basis points between june and december  we took steps to reduce potential exposure to a possible declining interest rate environment in the future 
significant steps during included our purchase of million in interest rate floors  the continued acquisition of cd interest rate swaps and the extension of the average life of our investment portfolio from four years to five years 
as a result of these and other actions  the volatility of our interest rate sensitivity has been reduced in both the rising and falling interest rate environments as compared to december  net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to be  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was million  or higher than the rates unchanged scenario 
net interest income at risk for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was 
table of contents calculated at million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was million  or lower than the rates unchanged scenario 
these exposures were within our policy guidelines of 
beginning in the first quarter of  we reported our potential exposure to falling rates using basis points as compared to basis points in our interest income simulation modeling indicates that if interest rates were to remain unchanged in  we would expect to be exposed to the negative impact of a significant portion of our time deposits maturing and repricing at today s higher market rates  while a large portion of our assets are floating and therefore  already reflect today s market rates 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  no change in the balance sheet size or composition  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year basis points over one year we also model changes in the shape steepness of the yield curve  other parallel shifts in the yield  such as a basis point increase in interest rates  and balance sheet growth scenarios 
we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing 

table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future deposit activity 
volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb federal reserve bank stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit short term borrowings notes payable fhlb advances junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon 
litigation we are from time to time a party to litigation arising in the normal course of business 
management knows of no such threatened or pending legal actions against us that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  liquidity or operating results
