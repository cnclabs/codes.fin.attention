we continue to closely monitor our major commodities costs and are particularly concerned with the future cost of aluminum and the future cost and availability of hardwood flooring 
communication with key suppliers is ongoing  monitoring tools are in place and strategies to mitigate cost and availability issues are at the forefront of our planning activities 
due to the complexity of our manufacturing processes and diverse product line  supreme has historically recorded both favorable and unfavorable annual physical inventory adjustments 
to a large degree  this situation relates to supreme s commitment to provide a high level of product customization through engineering and design in order to meet the particular and unique transportation needs of our customers 
the physical inventory adjustments were a net unfavorable adjustment in the third quarter of million and a net favorable adjustment in the fourth quarter of 
million 
for  management has scheduled periodic physical inventories to provide analyses of improved reporting procedures and their related effect on inventories 
these more frequent physical inventories  combined with other initiatives relating to improved practices  should enable supreme to reduce the physical inventory adjustments and obtain this information on a more timely basis 
direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in our direct labor percentage benefited from the selling price increases and also improved as a result of incremental net sales to our large fleet customers 
these large orders of standardized units create labor efficiencies that are not attainable with our customized retail units 
overhead overhead as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in despite the higher net sales experienced in  the company was not able to achieve a lower overhead rate as a percentage of net sales principally due to increased amounts of group health insurance claim costs 
these costs increased million  or  year over year 
the company is introducing wellness programs to its employees and is making design changes to its group health plan in an effort to control future claim costs

million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the higher selling expenses related primarily to a reduction in cooperative marketing funds the company receives from chassis manufacturers 
these funds  determined solely by programs established by the chassis manufacturers  have historically been used to offset marketing and promotional expenses 
to a lesser extent  selling expenses were higher due to compensation related costs associated with the increase in net sales 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily associated with the increase in incentive pay tied directly to the increase in pretax income

of net sales for the year ended december  from million 
of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense resulted from higher levels of borrowings against the company s revolving line of credit and higher short term interest rates

operating activities operating activities generated cash of million in compared to million in net income was the largest source of cash generated from operations in working capital increased million during  principally due to higher levels of inventories 
the inventories increased as a result of higher cost of raw materials  higher levels of finished goods related to the pre building of large fleet orders to avoid the necessity of a second shift to meet demand  and higher levels of purchased chassis in our bus and armored divisions 
investing activities investing activities used million of cash in compared to million in major capital expenditures in related to additional plant expansions at our georgia  pennsylvania and texas locations 
also  the company purchased a storage facility adjacent to its fiberglass reinforced plywood operations in indiana 
this acquisition replaced a previously leased facility 
the company intends to have lower levels of additions to property  plant and equipment in as compared to  however  we will consider strategic acquisitions should they present themselves

all borrowings under the revolving line of credit remain unsecured 
during  the company obtained financing for the acquisition of real estate and equipment for its new facility adjacent to our existing facility in pennsylvania 
the funds borrowed totaled million at a fixed rate of 
these funds were obtained through a job creation and retention program created as a part of the governor of pennsylvania s economic stimulus program 
comparison of with revenue includes net sales and other income 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the million for the year ended december  all of the company s major product lines increased over the levels experienced in the largest increase in net sales was in the company s dry freight product line which grew million over the balance of the increase in net sales was spread over its remaining product lines 
the opening of the company s northwest production facility in oregon during contributed million to the increase in net sales  primarily in the dry freight area 
the improved market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of carried over into on a unit basis  new orders increased approximately  and backlog grew to a record million 
while the company implemented several price increases during  these price increases only impacted revenues by an estimated to due to the company s significant backlog and policy of honoring quotes outstanding at the time of the increase 
other income decreased million to 
million in from million in gains on sale of property  plant and equipment were  in compared to million in and this accounted for most of the decrease in other income 
the million of gains in was principally attributable to the sale of two buildings no longer used in the business operations 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined in to from in the startup and training costs of approximately million at the company s new oregon manufacturing facility impacted margins  however  the most significant cause for the decrease in gross profit was the unprecedented rise in the company s raw material costs 
the following table presents the components of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and their change from year to year percent change material direct labor overhead delivery cost of sales gross profit the company experienced rapidly escalating raw material costs throughout the most significant increases were encountered in the company s steel purchases which aggregate approximately of total raw material purchases 
steel costs  on average  increased approximately during from the levels paid during cost of all other major raw material items also increased significantly in from the levels experienced in cost of resins and gelcoats used in the company s composites products increased and  respectively 
plywood costs spiked as high as  but leveled off at over prices paid in other items experiencing cost increases as compared with were flooring at and aluminum at to 
at the end of  the company s major suppliers were indicating that they did not see an end to escalating raw material costs 
raw materials anticipated to be most affected in were steel  resins and gelcoats 
the company seeks to purchase its raw material requirements at the best terms and prices possible and continues to expand vendor relationships both domestically and internationally 
the slight increase in direct labor of 
was attributed primarily to startup and training costs at the company s bus operation in california  its new oregon facility and  to a lesser extent  the armored plant startup in texas 
both overhead and delivery expenses improved as a percentage of net sales in when compared to the improvement in overhead was due to the fixed nature of certain expenses that do not fluctuate when volume changes 
the company has been unfavorably impacted since by rising overhead expenses that the company has been unable to pass on due to competitive market conditions 
the categories that have felt the most pressure are commercial and general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance and group health insurance 
to improve gross profit and mitigate rising material costs  the company implemented a series of price increases beginning march the most recent price increase was effective january  the cumulative effect of these price increases totaled approximately 
product lines containing large amounts of steel and composite materials had price increases significantly above average 
prior to the march increases  the company had not had a price increase since june industry practice is such that price increases take effect approximately days after announcement 
in addition  firm backlogged orders historically have been honored and not subject to price increases for either escalating material cost increases or otherwise 
as a result of significant backlogs approximately to days throughout the year  each of the price increases did not take effect for to months after announcement 
therefore  we estimate that approximately million of material cost increases were not recovered through price increases in to help eliminate the effect of the above industry practices  the company now makes its price increases effective immediately  while attempting to include escalation provisions in large fleet orders 
with regard to dealer and direct non fleet backlogged business  the company evaluated various strategies for more post order pricing flexibility 
changing historical industry practices is a long term effort and therefore should material costs continue to escalate  there will continue to be a degree of material cost increase absorption due to the delay in effectiveness of price increases 
in addition  competitive conditions in certain markets and products affect the net selling price the company may realize and it is difficult to predict the effect our price increases may have on customer demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the largest component of selling  general and administrative expense was compensation related expense which comprised approximately and of total selling  general and administrative expenses in and  respectively 
the dollar increase in related to additional commission expense on increased net sales  additional incentive programs that resulted in higher volume and investment in upgrading the company s sales literature 
the company benefited from cooperative marketing income in both and in approximately the same dollar amounts 
these cooperative marketing funds  received from original equipment manufacturers oem  are used to offset marketing and promotional expenses for the company s products 
there is no assurance that these programs will continue or that the company will benefit from these programs as the oem tend to reduce them as their business improves 
interest expense increased  in to  from  in the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of gradually increasing interest rates and additional borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement to fund increases in accounts receivable and inventories associated with substantially higher net sales throughout the company s effective income tax rate was for compared to in the favorable rate reduction in resulted from federal and state research and development tax credits claimed on amended tax filings 
additionally  other tax reserves were credited to income as they were no longer required as the result of the favorable conclusion of tax audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on open years see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income for was million  or 
per diluted share compared to million  or

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance and accrued warranty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of products and provides a provision for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of standard bills of material 
because of the customized nature of the company s products  it is difficult to place full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments  which are based on estimates  are necessary in an effort to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the estimate calculations consider the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not known until the annual physical inventories 
in prior years  management had concluded that it is not practical to consider more frequent physical inventories because of the sales order backlog and the costs associated with ceasing production for the purpose of conducting physical inventories 
during  the company s annual physical inventories resulted in a net unfavorable adjustment of million which was recorded in the third quarter 
subsequently  management has dedicated significant in house resources refining bills of materials  improving cost accounting functions and instituting new inventory policies and procedures 
in addition  management has implemented more frequent physical inventories and expects the new policies  procedures and frequent physical inventories will minimize favorable or unfavorable inventory and cost of sales adjustments 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates and any subsequent changes in estimates may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
effective january   the company began utilizing its newly formed and wholly owned small captive insurance company to insure certain of its business risks 
certain risks  previously self insured by the company and its subsidiaries  are now insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
in addition  certain business risks not previously insured are now insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
since the captive insurance company has not reinsured any of its coverages  the company s overall self insurance risk has not changed 
the captive insurance subsidiary is expected to help the company manage its risk exposures and under the internal revenue code the net underwriting income of a small captive  as defined  is not taxable 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale 
estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of sale and are based upon historical experience 
pending accounting pronouncements see new accounting standards to be adopted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  other than historical facts  which reflect the view of the company s management with respect to future events 
when used in this report  words such as believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  and similar expressions  as they relate to the company or its plans or operations  identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions made by  and information currently available to  the company s management 
although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  and it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such expectations include  without limitation  limitations on the availability of chassis on which the company s product is dependent  availability of raw materials  raw material cost increases and severe interest rate increases 
furthermore  the company can provide no assurance that such raw material cost increases can be passed on to its customers through implementation of price increases for the company s products 
the forward looking statements contained herein reflect the current view of the company s management with respect to future events and are subject to those factors and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to the operations  results of operations  cash flows and financial position of the company 
the company assumes no obligation to update the forward looking statements or to update the reasons actual results could differ from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
control risks while the company believes its control systems are effective  there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls  disclosure controls  and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
in addition  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more persons  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of investing  financing and operating 
the company s primary risk exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
in an effort to manage risk exposures  the company strives to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions 
the company s revolving line of credit is floating rate debt and bears interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus certain basis points depending on the pricing option selected and the company s leverage ratio 
at december   the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement dated july  the interest rate swap agreement is a contract to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreement and is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure of credit loss 
the differential paid or received under the interest rate swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the following is a summary of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  notional amount fixed rate maturity july  based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
