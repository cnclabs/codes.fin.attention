executive summary and overview the company provides services and equipment to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet that is ultimately dependent upon oil and natural gas prices that  in turn  are determined by the supply demand relationship for oil and natural gas 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
fiscal domestic results of operations improved significantly as compared to fiscal the company s domestic based revenues and operating profit increased approximately million and million  respectively  during the current fiscal year due to favorable commodity prices and an improved operating environment which resulted in increased demand for the company s vessels which in turn resulted in an escalation of vessel dayrates 
a significant portion of the company s increase in domestic based revenues went directly to operating profit because operating costs and depreciation did not change proportionally when revenue changed 
hurricanes katrina and rita caused extensive damage to the energy industry infrastructure in the gulf of mexico and along the us gulf coast resulting in an interruption in oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico 
given the damage sustained to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure  management anticipates its vessels to be in high demand in the gulf of mexico for the near term while repairs are made to offshore pipelines and platforms 
fiscal s domestic based operating costs increased a modest as compared to fiscal the number of available drilling rigs in the us market will be the primary driver of the company s future profitability in the domestic market 
the strength of the international drilling market has attracted offshore rigs from the us market over the past few years 
over the longer term  the company s domestic based fleet utilization will be influenced more by the active offshore rig count than by any other single outside influence  although the number of available units of competitor companies will also have a significant effect 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for crude oil 
during fiscal international based revenues and operating profit increased approximately million and million  respectively  as compared to fiscal due to strong demand for natural resources  and an improved operating environment which in turn resulted in an escalation of vessel dayrates 
in addition  fiscal international based vessel revenues were slightly offset by higher operating costs and depreciation expense resulting from an increased number of vessels operating in the international market during fiscal due to new vessel deliveries throughout the current fiscal year 
fiscal s international based operating costs increased approximately from fiscal levels 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of six of its kmar class of anchor handling towing supply vessels to deep sea supply asa for a total cash price of million 
the transaction resulted in a million pre tax financial gain  or approximately million after tax  or per diluted common share 
the transaction resulted in an approximate million taxable gain  but no cash taxes are due because of the availability of net operating loss carryforwards 
the company used a portion of the proceeds of the sale to repay million of then outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company also sold and or scrapped an additional vessels which resulted in additional gains on sales of assets of approximately million during fiscal fiscal witnessed the delivery of newly constructed vessels  which consisted of anchor handling towing supply vessels  one platform supply vessel and seven crewboats 
three of the newly constructed anchor handlers are deepwater class vessels 
the remaining newly built anchor handlers and the platform supply vessels expanded the company s core vessel fleet 
to date  the company has funded all of its vessel commitment programs from current cash balances  operating cash flow  and funds provided by its million senior unsecured notes and its revolving credit facility 
the provisions of the american jobs creation act of the act  were effective for the company as of april   and allowed the company to omit recording deferred tax assets or liabilities on future undistributed earnings of most non us subsidiaries and business ventures that it considers indefinitely reinvested abroad 
at march   the company reversed all previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities related to timing differences  foreign tax credits  or prior undistributed earnings of these entities whose future and prior earnings are now anticipated to be indefinitely reinvested abroad 
this resulted in an approximate million reduction of income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to the april  effective date of the act  the company provided income taxes at the us statutory rate on generally all profits the company generated from both us and international operations 
effective april  income taxes on earnings generated in the us are provided for at the us statutory income tax rate and the company earnings generated from international operations which we expect to be permanently invested abroad is provided at the tax rates of the respective countries where the profits are generated 
generally  these international tax rates are significantly less than the us statutory income tax rate  therefore  the company s consolidated effective tax rate is significantly lower post april  than what the company historically experienced 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate in the future could be more volatile as a result of changing profit levels from the various countries in which the company operates 
key focus for fiscal and outlook during fiscal  the company focused on strengthening its balance sheet  improving its domestic profitability  growing its international markets  and regenerating its vessel fleet in order to generate future earnings capacity 
the company strengthened its balance sheet by selling its kmar class of vessels for million in cash that resulted in a million pre tax financial gain 
the company used these funds to maintain its financial strength by eliminating an existing million outstanding debt under the company s revolving credit agreement  initiating a stock repurchase program and to continue to reinvest in new equipment 
in the company s operating business  management focused on improving dayrates and utilization  maintaining disciplined cost control in the sourcing of critical supplies and services  and obtained favorable tax incentives 
fiscal was a year of strong financial performance with solid improvements in revenue  operating profit and earnings per share  all building the foundation for long term growth 

table of contents 
index to financial statements given the progress the company has made in executing its strategies  the company is poised to continue to grow organically and  given the right opportunity  to grow through targeted and disciplined acquisitions 
the company will continue to pursue its long term growth strategies on a disciplined basis 
the company has targeted two additional dimensions within its growth initiatives to include assessing opportunities for its older fleet  and targeted acquisitions 
in each case  the company will carefully consider whether proposed transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
these areas of opportunity have a common theme which is to leverage the company s existing strengths and capitalize on favorable market conditions to improve operating profit  earnings per share and cash flows

table of contents 
index to financial statements while the company does not have any other commitments for new build vessel contracts other than what is discussed above  the company anticipates that over the next several years  it will continue to build  acquire or lease newer vessels in order to replace its aging vessels 
the majority of the company s supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and will need to be replaced within the next several years 
in addition to age  market conditions also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacities or new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund over the next few years the continuing replacement of the company s mature fleet of vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels 
the company believes that adequate capital resources will be available to continue its fleet replacement

in conjunction with the acquisition of the vessels  it was agreed that  for a two year period and subject to satisfactory performance  the company would provide to ensco all of its discretionary vessel requirements in the gulf of mexico 
the day rates charged under the arrangement were based upon predetermined pricing criteria 
the original agreement expired on march  and a one year extension under similar terms was agreed to which expired on march  a second one year extension has been agreed to which will expire on march  during fiscal  the company took delivery of two large  platform supply vessels one constructed by a brazilian shipyard and the other by a shipyard in the far east 
the company also took delivery of nine next generation supply vessels  ranging in size from foot to foot  for approximately million 
the company s shipyard  quality shipyard  llc  constructed three of the next generation supply vessels and two other us shipyards constructed the remaining six vessels 
although the nine vessels are intermediate in size and are technically capable of working in certain deepwater markets  they were constructed to replace older supply vessels 
also during fiscal  the company purchased two  bhp anchor handling towing supply vessel for approximately million  purchased one offshore tug for approximately million and took delivery of three water jet crewboats that were constructed in holland for approximately million 
during fiscal  the company constructed and delivered to the market  for an approximate total cost of million  two crewboats whose construction contracts the company assumed from crewboats  inc  a privately held  independent provider of crewboat services in the gulf of mexico during fiscal the company also delivered to the market during fiscal  for an approximate total cost of million  three foot  state of the art  fast  crew supply boats that blend the speed of a crewboat with the capabilities of a supply vessel 
all three vessels were constructed at a us shipyard that is currently constructing one additional foot  fast  crew supply boats as discussed above

these departures  combined with the low activity levels of traditional gulf of mexico operators  left the active offshore rig count at its lowest level in ten years 
by late fiscal  the company concluded  based on mounting extrinsic evidence that low activity levels in the gulf of mexico could possibly persist for an extended period of time 
management reviewed the recoverability of the values of its gulf of mexico operating assets and recorded in march a non cash asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share relating to older gulf of mexico supply vessels 
as a result of the prolonged weakness in the gulf of mexico drilling market  a majority of the vessels were stacked for as long as several years and were viewed as unlikely to return to service 
due to the average age of the vessels years  outdated specifications low horsepower and cargo capacities relative to competing equipment  significant costs to repair and return the vessels to service average approximately  per vessel and an anticipation of low customer demand for the vessels in the future  the company concluded it was unlikely that these vessels would return to active

based on such factors  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the asset impairment charge noted above was taken to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value at march  the fair value of the vessels was determined based upon management s estimate of liquidation values that could be realized in sales to unrelated purchasers and included an assumption that a significant number of the vessels as much as may have to be scrapped 
disposal of the assets may take an extended period of time due to the vessels outdated specifications 
two vessels from this group of impaired vessels were sold during fiscal and an additional impaired vessels were sold and or scrapped during fiscal the company has previously disclosed that it is the subject of an informal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission sec related to the million impairment charge that it recorded in its fiscal year ended march  that was related to stacked vessels that had been used in the gulf of mexico 
the company is in discussions with the sec in an effort to resolve the matters raised by the inquiry 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the timing or ultimate outcome of these discussions 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reviewed  for impairment purposes  all stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share to reduce the carrying amount of stacked vessels as to which an impairment charge had not been taken in fiscal but which were subsequently identified as being unlikely to return to active service 
an impairment review during fiscal resulted in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million million after tax  or per share on eight additional vessels that are withdrawn from service as to which an impairment charge had not been taken previously 
general market conditions and results of operations offshore service vessels provide a diverse range of services and equipment to the energy industry 
fleet size  utilization and vessel day rates primarily determine the amount of revenues and operating profit because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally when revenue changes 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors that affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demands  vessel age and scheduled drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
whenever possible  vessel drydockings are scheduled in order to minimize any impact on vessel operations and are only done if economically justified  given the vessel s age and physical condition

comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal domestic results of operations benefited from strong industry fundamentals which translated into higher utilization and average day rates for the company s domestic based vessel fleet 
prospects for growth in the offshore market in the gulf of mexico have shown significant improvement during the past year 
however  hurricanes katrina and rita have caused extensive damage to the energy industry infrastructure in the gulf of mexico and along the us gulf coast resulting in an interruption in oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico 
the us minerals management service mms statistical report on production shut ins due to hurricanes katrina and rita dated march  reported that total shut in oil production  for the period of september  to march   totaled approximately of the yearly us gulf oil production 
during this same period of time  natural gas shut in totaled approximately of the yearly us gulf gas production as reported by mms 
pre storm offshore rig demand improved greatly and drilling activity was forecast to remain at improved levels well into the exploration and production e p companies have contracted offshore drilling rigs for longer durations than in past periods due to concerns over rig availability in the domestic market 
the market for offshore support vessels 
table of contents 
index to financial statements tightened as drilling operators discovered that offshore vessels currently in service are in short supply 
the gulf of mexico supply boat market still has a significant number of vessels stacked that could resume active status  but only after expenditures to drydock to re certify the vessels 
the company did not experience any injuries to its personnel or damage or interruption of service to its fleet of vessels serving the offshore oil and gas industry in the gulf of mexico due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
the aftermath of the storms did not have any material impact on the company s ability to respond to customer needs or its ability to fulfill contract commitments 
demand for the company s available domestic based vessels prior to the two storms was strong and business has been brisk since the storms  with charter rates exceeding levels that were achieved in prior industry upturns in and domestic results of operations are primarily driven by natural gas exploration and production and  given the damage sustained to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure  management anticipates its vessels to be in high demand in the gulf of mexico for the near term while repairs are made to offshore pipelines and platforms 
while the repair work in the gulf of mexico is expected to keep domestic based vessel demand high for the near term  the offshore rig count in the gulf of mexico remains relatively depressed as compared to past up cycles 
the uptick in domestic based business during the second half of fiscal is related to the repair work resulting from damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
upon completion of the needed repair work in the us gulf of mexico  and assuming no significant damage from any hurricanes during  the number of available drilling rigs in the us market will be the primary driver of the company s future profitability in the domestic market 
the strength of the international drilling market has attracted offshore rigs from the us market over the past few years 
this capacity constraint is forcing some e p companies to delay drilling programs 
over the longer term  the company s domestic based fleet will be influenced more by the active offshore rig count than by any other single outside influence 
recent analysts reports indicate that over the next years offshore drilling rig count will increase as the newbuild order books for jackup rigs currently stand at approximately rigs 
nine of these rigs are scheduled to be delivered in calendar while calendar years  and expect to have  and rig deliveries  respectively 
historically  the company s international results of operations have been primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for crude oil and crude oil prices are presently at historically high levels 
the company s fiscal international results of operations benefited from higher average day rates  utilization and an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally 
improvements in the company s average day rates and utilization are due to increases in international e p spending and an increase in rig utilization in the international arena 
industry analysts are forecasting that demand for crude oil will likely remain strong throughout calendar year and expect future crude oil prices to remain at high levels due to strong domestic and international demand  tight crude oil inventory supplies and continued concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain countries that are members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
analysts also forecast that calendar year e p spending in the international markets will increase approximately from amounts spent in calendar management anticipates international vessel demand will continue to improve along with these market conditions  although the demand will be limited by the availability of drilling and production units to serve the industry 
there are also a number of vessels under construction in the industry that will enter into service in the coming year that will increase the available supply of vessels to satisfy customer demands 
the company s properties and equipment were unaffected by hurricanes katrina and rita  which affected the gulf coast region of the united states 
the company s fleet of vessels operating in the gulf of mexico did not sustain any damage and the company s main operational base in amelia  louisiana suffered only power and telephone outages 
the company s corporate headquarters located in new orleans  louisiana did not sustain damage but was inaccessible for business for approximately three months 
during this period  the company s new orleans based staff personnel were assigned to the company s main operational base in amelia  louisiana while the company s senior management group operated from the company s houston  texas office 
the company s shipyard  quality shipyards  llc located in houma  louisiana also did not sustain any damage 
all international operations of the company were unaffected by the two storms 
the company s corporate headquarters are accessible for business and its new orleans based staff personnel have resumed operations in new orleans while the company s senior management group operates in both the new orleans and houston offices 
the company maintains insurance against property damage  including extra expense coverage which covers costs incurred to continue as nearly as practicable the normal operations of the business

lastly  utilization rates and average day rates on the domestic based offshore tugs increased approximately and  respectively  during fiscal as compared to fiscal us based operating profit increased approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher revenues 
revenues generated during fiscal were slightly offset by higher vessel operating costs  specifically crew costs which increased due to competitive pressure on wages rates 
international based vessel revenues increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in average day rates on all vessel classes 
the company s international deepwater class  towing supply supply class and crew utility class of vessels generated approximately  and  respectively  of the revenue growth during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s offshore tugs and other class of vessel also made positive contributions to fiscal s revenue growth  each contributing approximately and  respectively  to the increase in revenues earned 
revenues also improved due to an increase in total utilization of the international based fleet which increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal international based vessel operating profit increased  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher revenues 
higher revenues were partially offset by increases in crew costs resulting from an increase of vessels operating in the international market and due to additional united kingdom multi employer retirement fund expense and depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of vessels operating in the international market 
increases in depreciation expense is a result of adding newly built vessels to the company s fleet of vessels 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company performed a thorough review of all vessels withdrawn from service and stacked vessels in the company s fleet and during the third quarter of fiscal  the company performed a thorough review of all vessels in its fleet for asset impairment 
the reviews resulted in a december impairment charge of million on eight vessels withdrawn from service 
the eight vessels were written down to each vessel s respective estimated fair value 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal to reduce the carrying amount of stacked vessels that were unlikely to return to active service 
due to an improved safety record and lower claim costs and loss reserves  the company s insurance and loss reserve costs decreased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal other marine services operating profit which consist of operating profit on the company s shipyard operations  brokered vessel and other marine services lines of business were comparable to fiscal levels 
fiscal gain on sales of assets increased significantly as compared to fiscal due primarily to the july  sale of six kmar class of anchor handling towing supply vessels to deep sea supply asa for a total cash price of million 
the transaction resulted in a million pre tax financial gain

the company also sold and or scrapped an additional vessels which resulted in additional gains on sales of assets of approximately million during fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal persistent weakness in the natural gas drilling market in the us gulf of mexico continued to negatively impact the company s domestic results of operations during fiscal  however  prospects for growth in the offshore drilling market in the gulf of mexico did show promise because of several positive developments that occurred during fiscal in august  the western gulf of mexico lease sale received solid bids 
bids for shallow water tracts were up and high bids for deepwater tracts increased from the previous year s sale 
the texas state lease sale  which was held in january  reported to have had its best showing in six years and the independent exploration and production e p companies were dominant bidders at the central gulf of mexico lease sales held in march analysts forecast that worldwide e p expenditures would increase in calendar year due to continuing strong demand for natural resources despite historically high crude oil prices and lofty natural gas prices 
sizeable portions of the increase in capital spending was expected to be spent in north america 
industry analysts reported that many companies planned on increasing their calendar year e p budgets on deepwater activities in the gulf of mexico 
offshore rig demand was showing signs of strengthening and drilling activity was likely to improve 
the e p companies began to contract offshore drilling rigs for longer durations than in past periods due to concerns over rig availability in the domestic market 
the market for offshore support vessels tightened during fiscal as drilling operators discovered that offshore vessels then in service were in short supply 
during fiscal  the gulf of mexico supply boat market still had a significant number of vessels stacked that could have resumed active status  but only after significant expenditures to drydock and re certify the vessels 
natural gas pricing is a critical factor in e p companies development of capital spending budgets 
weather was a major driver of natural gas pricing during calendar year the latter half of calendar witnessed natural gas inventories exceed five year inventory averages due to mild summer and winter weather 
disappointing storage withdrawals due to the mild weather applied downward pressure on natural gas commodity prices 
the downward pricing trend appeared to reverse during the first quarter of calendar year as inventories for natural gas began decreasing 
management was pleased by the strength that developed in the offshore drilling market during fiscal despite the challenge presented in predicting how domestic based vessel demand would be affected in the upcoming quarters 
the company s international results of operations for fiscal benefited from higher utilization and average day rates and an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally 
industry analysts forecast that demand for crude oil would remain strong throughout calendar year and beyond and expected future crude oil prices to remain at attractive levels due to high consumer demand  a tightening of crude inventory supplies and concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec countries 
during fiscal  analysts estimated that profitable international offshore markets would receive notable increases in exploration and production spending in due to strong demand for crude oil and higher commodity prices for the resource 
management anticipated international vessel demand to improve along with the market conditions 
domestic based vessel revenues decreased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal due to a decrease in the number of vessels operating in the domestic market resulting from the redeployment of vessels to international growth areas  an increase in vessel sales specifically crewboats and offshore tugs and lower utilization and average day rates on the company s offshore tugs 
revenues generated by the towing supply supply vessel class  the company s major income producing vessel class in the domestic market  increased approximately compared to fiscal due to a increase in utilization and a increase in average day rates 
international based vessel revenues for fiscal increased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal due to an increase in the number of vessels operating in international markets and due to higher utilization and average day rates on the company s deepwater class of vessels  which contributed of the increase in revenue growth for fiscal as compared to fiscal the

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an asset impairment charge of million was recorded to write down the carrying value of these assets to fair value at march  an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal to reduce the carrying amount of stacked vessels that are unlikely to return to active service 
international based vessel operating profit was comparable to fiscal despite higher revenues due to increases in international vessel operating costs  specifically crew costs  fuel  lube and supplies  and depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of vessels including vessels moved by the company from the gulf of mexico operating in the international market 
due to the level of vessel activity experienced and to a positive safety performance on a year to date basis  marine results of operations for fiscal includes million of net insurance premium rebates as provided for in our insurance program 
the company has an opportunity to obtain additional insurance premium rebates in the future should the positive safety performance continue 
the company recorded million of premium rebates during fiscal fiscal s gain on sales of assets increased approximately compared to fiscal due to an increase in the number of vessels sold 
vessel class statistics vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated on active vessels only and  as such  do not include vessel withdrawn from active service or joint venture vessels

this action is taken to reduce operating costs when management does not foresee adequate marketing possibilities in the near future 
vessels are added to this list when market conditions warrant and they are removed from this list when sold or otherwise disposed of or when returned to active service

total interest and debt costs incurred in fiscal were considerably higher than the previous two fiscal years because the relative portion of interest cost capitalized during fiscal was less than in fiscal years and due to the reduced level of investments in the company s new construction program during the current fiscal year 
other liquidity matters while the company does not have any other commitments for new build vessel contracts other than what is discussed in the vessel construction and acquisitions section of item  the company anticipates that over the next several years  it will continue to build  acquire or lease newer vessels in order to replace its aging vessels 
the majority of the company s supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and will need to be replaced within the next several years 
in addition to age  market conditions also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacities or new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund over the next few years the continuing replacement of the company s mature fleet of vessels  with emphasis on the international anchor handling towing supply vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the recorded values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company s estimates and assumptions affect its recognition of deferred expenses  bad debts  income taxes  the carrying value of its long lived assets and goodwill  and its provision for certain contingencies 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to one week 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for doubtful accounts 
goodwill 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  using carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and international operations 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s related weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics are grouped for asset impairment testing 

table of contents 
index to financial statements although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
during fiscal  the company refined its asset groupings to increase the number of asset groups and better reflect the composition of its fleet and the markets within which it currently operates 
in addition to the periodic review of long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months 
this review considers items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked and likelihood of a return to active service  among others 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or stacked vessel that is unlikely to return to service exceeds its estimated fair value 
income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances quarterly 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs 
the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also has the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year period and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses 
the company self insures potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the company also sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan that covers eligible us fleet personnel and eligible employees of the company hired after december  and a post retirement plan for qualified retired employees 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined in accordance with sfas accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  amortization of prior service costs or benefits  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also provides postretirement benefits to qualified retired employees 
the postretirement program provides limited health care and life insurance benefits 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits 
this plan is not funded 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance that had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only 
this standard  together with a new rule adopted by the securities and exchange commission in april  is effective for the company as of april  and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date 
the ultimate amount of increased compensation expense will be dependent on the number of option shares granted  their timing and vesting period and the method used to calculate the fair value of the awards  among other factors 
based on stock options outstanding as of march   the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to result in the recognition of million of future compensation expense  of which million is expected to be recorded during fiscal from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  management believes that the impact of recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as the spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
due to the increase in business activity resulting from strong global oil and gas fundamentals  the competitive market for experienced crew personnel has exerted upward pressure on wages in the labor markets which increased the company s operating expenses 

table of contents 
index to financial statements also  the commodity price of steel has increased dramatically due to increased worldwide demand for the metal 
although prices have moderated some in calendar year  the price of steel remains high by historical standards 
if the price of steel continues to rise  the cost of new vessels will result in higher capital expenditures and depreciation expenses which will reduce the company s future operating profits 
environmental matters during the ordinary course of business the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations 
the company attempts to comply with these laws and regulations in order to avoid costly accidents and related environmental damage 
compliance with existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any environmentally hazardous material aboard its vessels and at shore base locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment 
item a

the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risk 
interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
the company s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are its cash equivalents and long term borrowings 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the cash equivalent investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investments 
the book value for cash equivalents is considered to be representative of its fair value 
at march   the company had million of debt outstanding which represents senior unsecured notes that were issued on july  the multiple series of notes with maturities ranging from years to years have an average outstanding life to maturity of years and can be retired prior to maturity without penalty

the company is exposed to possible interest rate fluctuations related to its commitment to the sale leaseback of four of its vessels to boal c 
on march   the company entered into four interest rate swap transactions to effectively fix the amount of the lease payments on four vessels currently under construction that the company agreed to sell and leaseback from boal c 
the lease payments for each respective vessel will be based on the five year swap rate at the time of the lease which will coincide with the delivery of each vessel 
any amounts received from the bank or paid to the bank will be recorded on the company s balance sheet as either an other asset or other liability and amortized over the term of the respective leases

foreign exchange risk 
the company s financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and currency commitments 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the company enters into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its risk management objectives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
the company had one currency spot contract outstanding at march  totaling approximately million that settled on april  the company had three currency spot contracts outstanding at march  totaling approximately million that settled on april  the company had no spot contracts outstanding at march  the company is exposed to possible currency fluctuations related to its commitment to construct two of its anchor handling towing supply vessels at an indonesian shipyard
