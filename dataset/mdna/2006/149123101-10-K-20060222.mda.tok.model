item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
information required by item is incorporated by reference from pages a through a of exhibit safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in our management s discussion and analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results 
the words believes  expects  estimates  anticipates  will be  should and similar words or expressions identify forward looking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 
uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses  as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 
world economic factors our projection for about percent growth in the world economy in assumes central banks will cautiously raise interest rates so as not to slow growth too much 
low interest rates  and continued good economic growth  should encourage further growth in construction and mining 
should central banks raise interest rates aggressively  both world economic growth and our machinery and engines sales likely would be weaker 
we expect the u 
s 
federal reserve will soon end its policy of raising interest rates and that the federal funds rate will end the year below five percent 
somewhat higher interest rates should cause a further slowing in economic growth to slightly over three percent in other financial factors long term interest rates  corporate bond spreads are expected to remain sufficiently favorable to support further growth in business investment 
should financial conditions tighten noticeably  causing economic growth to slow below three percent  expected improvements in machinery and engines sales likely would be lower than projected 
our projection of increased sales of machinery and engines in europe  africa  middle east eame in assumes that continued low interest rates will allow slightly faster economic growth in europe and that favorable commodity prices will extend healthy recoveries in both africa and middle east ame and the commonwealth of independent states cis 
key risks are significant interest rate increases in the eurozone that would slow the european economy or a worldwide collapse in commodity prices 
those developments would likely negatively impact our results 
page somewhat higher local interest rates in latin america in and slower economic growth in the united states are expected to contribute to a further slowing in latin american economic growth to slightly less than four percent 
that rate of growth should support further increases in construction spending  and high metals prices should benefit investment in mining  both contributing to an increase in machinery and engines sales 
this forecast is vulnerable to a significant weakening in commodity prices  widespread increases in interest rates or political disruptions 
in asia pacific  we project economic growth will remain slightly below percent in  with faster growth in australia and developing asia offsetting a slight slowing in china 
the projected increase in machinery and engines sales assumes that coal and metals prices will contribute to increased mine investment  growing populations and rising home prices will benefit housing construction  and rapid economic growth will prompt businesses to invest more in structures 
some developments that could lower expected results include reduced demand for thermal and coking coal  significant revaluations of regional currencies  restrictions on regional exports and sharp interest rate hikes  particularly in china and indonesia 
commodity prices commodities represent a significant sales opportunity  with prices and production as key drivers 
prices have improved sharply over the past three years and our outlook assumes that continued growth in world industrial production  low inventories and some difficulties in increasing production will cause metals prices to remain high enough in to encourage further mine investment 
any unexpected weakening in world industrial production  however  could cause prices to drop sharply to the detriment of our results 
coal prices showed softness in some regions late in but remained well above prices that make mine investment attractive 
we expect that the need to rebuild some coal stocks as well as increased electricity generation will support demand for coal in and prices will remain favorable 
should coal prices soften  due to a slowing in world economic growth or otherwise  the ongoing sales recovery would be vulnerable 
oil and natural gas prices increased sharply over the past three years due to strong demand and high capacity usage 
higher energy prices have not halted economic recoveries since strong demand boosted prices and world production increased 
high prices are encouraging more exploration and development 
however  should significant supply cuts occur  such as from opec production cuts or political unrest in a major producing country  the resulting oil shortages and price spikes could slow economies  potentially with a depressing impact on our sales 
monetary and fiscal policies for most companies operating in a global economy  monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the united states and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth  and accordingly  demand for our product 
in general  higher than expected interest rates  reductions in government spending  higher taxes  excessive currency movements and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand 
with economic data looking more favorable  central banks in several developed countries have raised interest rates from the lowest rates in decades  with the u 
s 
federal reserve bank being the most aggressive 
our outlook assumes that central banks will try to avoid increasing rates so much that economic recoveries stall 
should central banks raise interest rates more aggressively than anticipated  both economic growth and our sales could suffer 
budget deficits in many countries remain higher than governments would like 
our outlook assumes that governments will not aggressively raise taxes and slash spending to deal with their budget imbalances 
such actions could disrupt growth and negatively affect our sales 
political factors political factors in the united states and abroad can impact global companies 
our outlook assumes that no major disruptive changes in economic policies occur in either the united states or other major economies 
significant changes in either taxing or spending policies could reduce activities in sectors important to our businesses  thereby reducing sales 
page our outlook assumes that there will be no additional significant military conflicts in either north korea or the middle east in the forecast period 
such military conflicts could severely disrupt sales into countries affected  as well as nearby countries 
our outlook also assumes that there will be no major terrorist attacks 
if there is a major terrorist attack  confidence could be undermined  potentially causing a sharp drop in economic activities and our sales 
attacks in major developed economies would be the most disruptive 
our outlook assumes that efforts by countries to increase their exports will not result in retaliatory countermeasures by other countries to block such exports  particularly in the asia pacific region 
our outlook includes a negative impact from the phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion as enacted by the american jobs creation act of our outlook assumes any other tax law changes will not negatively impact our provision for income taxes 
currency fluctuations the company has costs and revenues in many currencies and is therefore exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations 
our outlook assumes no significant currency crises occur that could disrupt international trade or the competitiveness of our facilities 
should any crisis develop  economic activity and our results could be negatively impacted 
the company s largest manufacturing presence is in the united states  so any unexpected strengthening of the dollar tends to raise the foreign currency costs to our end users and reduce our global competitiveness 
dealer original equipment manufacturers inventory practices the company sells finished products through an independent dealer network or directly to original equipment manufacturers oem 
both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs 
such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively 
the current outlook assumes no major changes in either dealer or oem inventory practices 
should dealers or oems decide to control inventories more tightly  our sales would be lower 
financial products division factors inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers 
the creditworthiness of each customer  and the rate of delinquencies  repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors  including  but not limited to  relevant industry and economic conditions  the availability of capital  the experience and expertise of the customer s management team  commodity prices  political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 
additionally  interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt 
our match funding policy addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within pre determined ranges on an ongoing basis 
to achieve our match funding objectives  we issue debt with a similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds 
if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
with respect to our insurance and investment management operations  changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio  thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 
other factors the rates of infrastructure spending  housing starts  commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the company s results 
our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the united states or abroad  demand for our products may be significantly impacted 
projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors could include  among other things  higher than expected wages  energy and or material costs  and or higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in tax  trade  environmental  labor  safety  payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions in which the alliances conduct their operations 
page results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix 
our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales 
if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales  our results could be negatively impacted 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company s share of industry sales 
an unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  a failure to price the product competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets  leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and or used equipment prices 
the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint 
our sales outlook assumes that the company is successful in implementing worldwide machine price increases communicated to dealers with an effective date of january while we expect that the environment will absorb these price actions  delays in the marketplace acceptance would negatively impact our results 
moreover  additional price discounting to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated realization 
our sales and results are generally sensitive to changes in economic growth  particularly those originating in construction  mining and energy 
developments reducing such activities also tend to lower our sales 
in addition to the factors mentioned above  our sales and results could be negatively impacted by any of the following any sudden drop in consumer or business confidence  delays in legislation needed to fund public construction  regulatory or legislative changes that slow activity in key industries  and or unexpected collapses in stock markets 
this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive  but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook 
obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion  but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the company s actual results to differ from those currently anticipated
