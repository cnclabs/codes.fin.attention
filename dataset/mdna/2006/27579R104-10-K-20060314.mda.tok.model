item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries  or the company 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein 
information related to share volume and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split that became effective on or about june  critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all our significant accounting principles are described in note of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of our accounting principles require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  certain accounting principles require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas for available for sale securities  they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment level factors we examine to assess impairment include the severity and duration of the loss  an analysis of the issuers of the securities and if there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we reexamine the financial resources and overall ability the company has and the intent management has to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
aside from the corporate debt security that was determined to be impaired  resulting in a thousand writedown during the first quarter of  we did not have any other investment securities that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and chargeoff trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished good prices as well as acts of nature earthquakes  floods  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
during the third quarter of  we enhanced our migration analysis methodology by increasing the number of risk rated loan pools from six to eighteen categories and extending the loss horizon from five to thirteen years 
a more detailed discussion of this enhanced methodology can be found in management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we will continue to enhance our methodologies to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio 
changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should also be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein including the section entitled loans and allowance for loan losses 
loan sales we routinely sell  and occasionally securitize  residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors 
when mortgage loans are sold  we generally retain the right to service these loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the sold or securitized loans 
the gain on sale recorded on these loans depends  in part  on our allocation of the previous carrying amount of the loans to the retained interests 
previous carrying amounts are allocated in proportion to the relative fair values of the loans sold and the interests retained 
the fair values of retained interests are estimated based upon the present value of the associated expected future cash flows taking into consideration future prepayment rates  discount rates  expected credit losses  and other factors that impact the value of the retained interests 
we may also record mortgage servicing assets  or msa  when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer 
the company determines whether the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement 
the expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing 
in addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates  other assumptions such as the cost to service the underlying loans  foreclosure costs  ancillary income and float rates are also used in determining the value of the msas 
mortgage servicing assets are discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
overview was a year of both record earnings and strategic acquisitions for east west bank 
we achieved our ninth year of record earnings  achieving record net interest income  net earnings and earnings per share in since our initial public offering in  our net income has increased six fold  from million in to million in the significant increase in our net income over the past several years was driven primarily by the steady annual growth in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities 
other factors contributing to this achievement include our ability to balance rapid growth with sound underwriting standards resulting in sustained strong asset quality  our steadfast focus on controlling operating expenses which have favorably impacted our efficiency ratios  and our consistent ability to effectively integrate operations and maximize returns from past acquisitions 
during  we completed another successful acquisition our largest acquisition to date 
united national bank was headquartered in san marino  california and provided community banking services through eleven branches  with eight located in southern california  two in northern california and one in houston  texas 
as of the transaction closing date of september   unb had total assets of million  net loans of million  and total deposits of million 
we were able to successfully integrate all of unb s systems into our infrastructure shortly after the closing of the transaction 
the acquisition added several thousand deposit customers to our existing customer base  generating additional lending and deposit opportunities for the company 
the acquisition resulted in total goodwill of million and core deposit premium of million 
additionally  on december   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire standard bank  a federal savings bank headquartered in monterey park  california 
standard bank provides banking services to the community through six branches in the los angeles metropolitan area 
at december   standard bank had total assets of million net loans of million and total deposits of million 
under the terms of the agreement  the shareholders of standard bank will receive consideration of two times book value  or approximately million 
the shareholders of standard bank will receive a minimum of and up to of the merger consideration in shares of east west bancorp common stock 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of  subject to requisite regulatory approvals 
the impact of this acquisition to earnings is expected to be approximately per share 
net income surpassed the million mark for the first time during  totaling million for the year  a increase from million  earned during on a per diluted share basis  we earned  or a increase from per diluted share earned during our return on average assets in was  compared to in and return on average equity was in  compared to in management expects net income per diluted common share for to be approximately higher than in based on a projected loan growth of to and deposit growth of approximately to 
our earnings projection for also assumes a stable or marginally increasing interest rate environment and continued operating efficiency 
net interest income increased to million during  compared with million during the increase in net interest income is predominantly due to continued loan growth and steady increases in interest rates by the federal reserve during partially offset by notable increases in market interest rates paid on our deposits and borrowings 
our net interest margin decreased basis points to during  compared to during assuming a stable or marginally increasing interest rate environment during  we anticipate the net interest margin for to be in the range of to 
noninterest income decreased to million during from million in the prior year  primarily due to lower net gain on sales of fixed assets in during  we recorded gains from the disposition of fixed assets in the amount of million compared to thousand recorded in the decrease in gain on sales of fixed assets was partially offset by an increase in net gain on investment securities available for sale  which increased to million in the increase in net gain on investment securities available for sale was due to improved market conditions 
additionally  we experienced growth in branch fees and letters of credit fees primarily due to overall increases in our asset and deposit base 
as a result of our continued expansion during  total noninterest expense increased to million in  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily driven by a increase in compensation and employee benefits and a increase in occupancy and equipment expenses 
the increases in both compensation and occupancy expense can be attributed to the recent acquisitions of united national bank during the year and trust bank in late furthermore  we continued to add relationship and operational personnel during the year to enhance and support our loan and deposit growth 
despite the sizable increase in overall expenses  our efficiency ratio  which represents noninterest expense excluding the amortization of intangibles and investments in affordable housing partnerships divided by the aggregate of net interest income before provision for loan losses and noninterest income  only increased to during  compared to during we believe this to be a reflection of our ability to efficiently and effectively utilize our resources and operating platform to support our continuing growth 
due to the overall growth of the bank and the recent relocation of our corporate headquarters  we anticipate noninterest expenses for to increase by to  but expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the to range 
total consolidated assets at december  increased to billion  compared with billion at december  a growth in gross loans was the primary driver of this increase 
excluding the impact of the unb acquisition as well as loan sales and securitizations  organic loan growth was  or billion  during we attribute overall loan growth to the expansion of relationships throughout california  the addition of seasoned and skilled banking professionals  and increased loan origination volume from our branch network 
we estimate loan growth in to be to  reflecting the core rate of growth in the bank s lending markets  the addition of new client relationships  and the utilization of additional lending programs and products 
total average assets increased to billion in  compared to billion in  due primarily to average loan growth 
total average loans grew to billion during  an increase of over the prior year 
all loan sectors experienced double digit growth year over year 
this increase in average loan growth was driven largely by increases in commercial real estate and residential multifamily loans 
total average deposits rose during to billion  compared to billion in we experienced gains in all deposit categories during  with the most significant contributions coming from time  money market and noninterest bearing demand deposits 
total nonperforming assets were million  or of total assets at december   compared with million  or of total assets  at december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   or of outstanding total loans 
net loan chargeoffs totaled million  or of average loans  during  compared with million  or of average loans  during we anticipate our overall asset quality to remain sound throughout we project that nonperforming assets will continue to be below of total assets and that net chargeoffs will remain below of average loans in we continue to be well capitalized under all regulatory guidelines with a tier i risk based capital ratio of  a total risk based capital ratio of  and a tier i leverage ratio of at december  during  we raised million in additional regulatory capital through the issuance of trust preferred securities in a trust preferred offering 
trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
we also issued million in subordinated debt through a private placement transaction 
subordinated debt qualifies as tier ii capital for regulatory purposes 
the net proceeds from the trust preferred and subordinated debt offerings were used to partially fund the acquisition of unb and also to support the continued growth of the bank 
results of operations net income for totaled million  compared with million for and million for  representing an increase of for and for on a per diluted share basis  net income was  and for  and  respectively 
the increases in net earnings during both and are primarily attributable to higher net interest income  partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher provision for income taxes 
our return on average total assets declined to in  compared to in and in  while the return on average stockholders equity increased to in  compared with in and in table components of net income year ended december  in millions net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense provision for income taxes net income return on average total assets return on average stockholders equity net interest income our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans  investment securities and other earning assets less the interest expense on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income in totaled million  a increase over net interest income of million in total interest and dividend income during increased to million compared with million during  primarily due to a growth in average earning assets combined with increased yields on all categories of earning assets 
the net growth in average earning assets was fueled by a growth in average loans  increasing to billion in  from billion in increases in all deposit categories  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  and long term debt funded the growth in average earning assets 
total interest expense during increased to million compared with million a year ago 
the increase in interest expense during is primarily attributable to higher rates paid on all categories of deposits and borrowings 
the increased volume of average time deposits  money market accounts  fhlb advances  and long term debt also contributed significantly to higher interest expense in compared to net interest margin  defined as net interest income divided by average earning assets  remained relatively stable  decreasing basis points to during  from during the overall yield on earning assets increased basis points to in  from in  due to several consecutive federal reserve interest rate increases during similarly  our overall cost of funds in increased by basis points to  compared to for the combined impact of an increasing interest rate environment and increased competition in the deposit market were the primary drivers of our increased cost of funds during to help fund our loan growth during  we increased our utilization of time deposits and fhlb advances  further contributing to the overall increase in our cost of funds for the year 
we also continue to rely heavily on noninterest bearing demand deposits as a significant funding source  with average noninterest bearing demand deposits increasing to billion during  compared with million during comparing to  our net interest margin decreased basis points to in  compared to in primarily due to a growth in average earning assets 
in  our overall yield on earning assets increased basis points to  from in  due to federal reserve interest rate increases during the second half of as well as the higher proportion of loans to total average assets during relative to our overall cost of funds also increased basis points to during  compared to during  in response to the increasing interest rate environment 
our increased reliance on fhlb advances and time deposits accounted for the majority of the increase in our cost of funds during the following table presents the net interest spread  net interest margin  average balances  interest income and expense  and the average yields and rates by asset and liability component for the years ended december   and table summary of selected financial data year ended december  average average average average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest dollars in thousands assets interest earning assets short term investments securities purchased under resale agreement investment securities loans receivable fhlb and frb stock total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity interest bearing liabilities checking accounts money market accounts savings deposits time deposits less than  time deposits  or greater federal funds purchased fhlb advances securities sold under repurchase agreements long term debt total interest bearing liabilities nonnterest bearing liabilities demand deposits other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest rate spread net interest income and net interest margin includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities and loans receivable totaling thousand  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

the fund provided state tax benefits beginning in until the end of  when the ric was officially dissolved 
while the company s management continues to believe that the tax benefits realized in previous years were appropriate and fully defensible under the existing tax codes at that time  the company has deemed it prudent to participate in the voluntary compliance initiative  or vci offered by the state of california to avoid certain potential penalties should the ftb choose to litigate its recently announced position about the tax treatment of rics for periods prior to enactment of the legislation described above and should the ftb be successful in that litigation 
pursuant to the vci program  we filed amended california income tax returns on april  for all affected years and paid the resulting taxes and interest due to the ftb 
this amounted to an aggregate payment of million for tax years   and we continue to believe that the tax deductions are appropriate and  as such  we have also filed refund claims for the amounts paid with the amended returns 
these refund claims are reflected as assets in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these actions amending our california income tax returns and subsequent related filing of refund claims we retain our potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position  in addition to our risk of not being successful in our refund claim for taxes and interest 
our potential exposure to all other penalties  however  has been eliminated through this course of action 
the franchise tax board is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing our refund claims for taxes and interest for tax years through management is continuing to pursue these claims  to monitor developments in the law in this area  and to monitor the status of tax claims with respect to other registered investment companies

balance sheet analysis total assets increased billion  or  to billion during the year ended december  the increase in total assets was primarily attributable to a growth in gross loans and a increase in investment securities available for sale

primarily  we offer arm loan programs that have six month  three  five  or seven year initial fixed periods 
we originate single family residential mortgage loans under three different types of programs  full alternative documentation  reduced documentation and no documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels 
our underwriting criteria for all the loans in our single family residential mortgage loan programs include minimum fico scores and maximum loan to value ratios 
additionally  our full alternative documentation loan program requires verification of employment and income 
reduced documentation loans are primarily intended for borrowers who are self employed 
generally  we require reduced documentation borrowers to have more equity in the property and higher amounts of liquid reserves 
finally  our no documentation loan program is designed for borrowers who demonstrate excellent credit quality and have the ability to place a large down payment or have high equity in the property

multifamily real estate loans 
we continue to place emphasis in the origination of multifamily loans and originated million multifamily loans in the year ended december  although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
multifamily real estate loans accounted for billion or and for billion or of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
we securitized million of multifamily loans through fnma during the year 
the securitizations were undertaken for liquidity and capital management purposes  with all of the resulting securities retained in our available for sale investment portfolio 
the securitizations were all accounted for as guaranteed mortgage securitizations which did not generate any gains or losses to operations 
we also recorded million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these multifamily securitizations since the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
we offer both fixed and arm multifamily loan programs 
primarily  we offer arm multifamily loan programs that have six month  three  or five year initial fixed periods 
we originate these prime multifamily mortgage loans under two different types of programs  full documentation and reduced documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels  similar to the programs mentioned in the single family residential loan programs 
underwriting criteria generally include minimum fico scores  maximum loan to value ratios and minimum debt coverage ratios 
additionally  we own single family and multifamily residential mortgage loans that have contractual features that may increase our credit exposure 
these mortgage loans include option adjustable rate mortgage loans that may subject borrowers to significant future payment increases or create the potential for negative amortization of the principal balance 
interest only mortgage loans allow interest only payments for fixed period of time 
at the end of the interest only period  the loan payment includes principal payments and increases significantly 
the borrower s new payment once the loan becomes amortizing ie  includes principal payments will be greater than if the borrower had been making principal payments since the origination of the loan 
the longer the interest only period  the larger the amortizing payment will be when the interest only period ends 
option adjustable rate mortgage loans permit different repayment options 
the monthly payment is set as the initial interest rate for the first year of the loan 
after that point  the borrower can make a minimum payment that is limited to a increase in payment 
if the minimum payment is not adequate to cover the interest amount due on the mortgage loan  the loan would have negative amortization  which will result in an increase in the mortgage loans principal balance 
these loans completely re amortize every five years and the monthly payment is reset at that point 
as of december  and  there was no negative amortization on any loans held in our portfolio 
we did not originate these loans and they were purchased several years ago

generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if either i principal or interest payments are past due in excess of days  or ii the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain  regardless of the length of past due status 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  any interest accrued on the loan is reversed and charged against current income 
in general  subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans that demonstrate a satisfactory payment trend for several months are returned to full accrual status subject to management s assessment of the full collectibility of the account

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
under sfas no 
 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
at december   we classified million of our loans as impaired  compared with million at december  specific reserves on impaired loans amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  our average recorded investment in impaired loans during and was million and million  respectively 
during and  gross interest income that would have been recorded on impaired loans  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  totaled million and thousand  respectively 
of this amount  actual interest recognized on impaired loans  on a cash basis  was thousand and thousand  respectively 
allowance for loan losses we are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
in addition to regular  quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to a continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period operating results  and is decreased by the amount of net chargeoffs during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december  the million increase in the allowance for loan losses at december   from year end  reflects million in additional loss provisions and million in loss reserves acquired from unb  reduced by million in net chargeoffs during the year 
moreover  we reclassified million from the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities during  representing additional loss allowances required for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit related primarily to our trade finance and affordable housing activities 
the provision for loan losses of million recorded in represents a decrease from the million in loss provisions recorded during net chargeoffs amounting to million represent of average loans outstanding during this compares to net chargeoffs of million  or of average loans outstanding  during we continue to record loss provisions to compensate for both the continued growth of our loan portfolio  which grew during  and our continued lending focus on increasing our portfolio of commercial real estate  commercial business  trade finance  and construction loans

the results from these two methodologies were compared to various ancillary analyses  including historical loss analyses  peer group comparisons  and analyses based on the federal regulatory interagency policy for loan and lease losses to determine an overall allowance requirement amount 
largely in response to the significant growth of the bank s loan portfolio in the past couple of years  we refined the classification migration analysis in the third quarter of to take into consideration the increasing diversity and risk profiles of loans within the same loan categories 
as a result of our enhanced approach to the classification migration analysis  management has determined that the individual loan review analysis methodology and separate historical loss analyses are no longer necessary in determining the overall adequacy of the allowance since the results of these analyses have been incorporated into the enhanced migration model 
under the classification migration approach implemented prior to the third quarter of  we utilized only six risk rated loan pools 
this now has been expanded to eighteen categories 
automobile loans and homogeneous loans  which are predominantly consumer related credits ie home equity lines  overdraft protection  and credit card loans  remain unchanged under the enhanced model 
all other categories ie single family residential  multifamily residential  commercial real estate  construction  and commercial business have been broken down into additional subcategories 
for example  instead of one commercial real estate loan category  this category has been segmented into six subcategories based on industry sector  namely  retail  office  industrial  land  hotel motel  and other miscellaneous 
by sectionalizing loan categories into smaller subgroups  we are better able to isolate and identify the risk associated with each subgroup based on historical loss trends 
in addition to increasing the number of loan categories  we have also expanded the loss horizon from five to thirteen years in order to better capture the bank s historical loss trends to make the analysis more complete and accurate 
the thirteen year loss horizon was selected because this represents the timeframe when the bank started to monitor and track losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
we continue to utilize minimum loss rates as a self correcting mechanism to better reflect the loss potential for certain categories that have little or no historical losses 
similar to the previous periods  minimum loss rates are established based on relative risk profiles for certain loan categories 
however  in contrast to previous periods  the current minimum loss rates utilized under the enhanced methodology more closely reflect historical loss rates than previously utilized minimum loss rates as a result of the expanded loss horizon 
for example  minimum loss rates on construction loans will be higher than minimum loss rates established for commercial real estate loans due to their riskier credit profiles 
even within various subgroups in a broad loan category such as commercial real estate  minimum loss rates are also established based on the relative risk profile of various industry sectors 
commercial real estate loans in the retail sector  for example  will have a lower minimum loss rate than commercial real estate loans in the hotel motel sector 
the allowance requirement for each pool continues to be based on the higher of historical loss factors or established minimum loss rates for each classification category ie pass  special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
besides quantitative adjustments  the enhanced classification migration methodology also utilizes qualitative adjustments which were previously considered in conjunction with the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these qualitative adjustments include  but are not limited to  credit concentrations  delinquency  nonaccrual and problem loan trends  qualification of lending management and staff  and quality of the loan review system 
qualitative adjustments can be either positive or negative  and generally range from to 
total net qualitative adjustments for each loan pool are reflected as a percent adjustment and are calculated on top of the required allowance amount based on historical losses or minimum loss rates 
by incorporating various qualitative adjustments into the migration methodology  we have essentially integrated the principles of the individual loan review analysis methodology 
previously  we used a estimation risk factor to compensate for the modeling risk associated with the classification migration and individual loan review analysis models 
additionally  we also used a economic risk factor in consideration of the tenuous state of the national economy  recent corporate scandals  continuing geopolitical instability in the middle east  and the unfavorable impact of fed rate increases on consumer cash flows 
the estimation and economic risk factors were considered unallocated reserves under the old method and totaled million as of december  with the enhanced migration model  both the estimation and economic risk factors are included in the qualitative adjustments for each loan category 
although a certain degree of subjectivity is still inevitable in determining the adequacy of the loan loss allowance  it is management s opinion that the new expanded classification migration method is more accurate in assessing the allowance requirement for each loan subcategory 
the following table reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated 
due to the changes in methodology discussed above  a trend comparison of the allowance requirement for individual loan types at december  compared to december  is no longer meaningful 
we will resume this analysis in the first quarter of when the allowance requirement as of march  will be derived in the same manner as the requirement at year end table allowance for loan losses by loan category at december  amount amount amount amount amount dollars in thousands font style display inline  font size pt  font family times new roman residential  single family residential  multifamily commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business automobile consumer and other other risks total includes trade finance loans

this organic deposit growth was comprised of noninterest bearing demand accounts of million or  money market accounts of million or  and time deposits of million or 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in savings accounts of million or and interest bearing checking accounts of million or during the year 
the net growth in non time deposit accounts can be attributed to the bank s efforts to expand its small and mid sized commercial customer base through programs at the retail branches that better align with the needs of these customers  while the growth in time deposits is due to the introduction of various new products and promotions during the year

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in the course of our business  we may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet and are considered to be off balance sheet arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements whereby an unconsolidated entity is a party  under which we have any obligation under a guarantee contract  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
loan securitizations and sales in the ordinary course of business  the company sells loans with or without recourse 
for loans sold with recourse  the recourse component is considered a guarantee 
in certain situations  the company could also have an obligation for loans sold without recourse 
additional information pertaining to our loan sales is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
from time to time  we securitize certain real estate loans  a portion of which are sold to investors 
securitizations provide us with a source of liquidity and also reduce our credit exposure to borrowers 
securitizations involve the sale of loans to a qualifying special purpose entity  or qspe  typically a trust 
generally  in a securitization  we transfer financial assets to a qspe that is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  which are secured by future collections on the sold loans 
the qspe sells securities to investors  which entitle them to receive specified cash flows during the term of the securities 
the qspe uses proceeds from the sale of these securities to pay the purchase price for the sold loans 
the proceeds from the issuance of the securities are then distributed to the company as consideration for the loans transferred 
when we sell or securitize loans  we generally retain the right to service the loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the securitized assets 
retained interests may provide credit enhancement to the investors and represent the company s maximum risk exposure associated with these transactions 
investors in the securities issued by the qspe have no further recourse against the company if cash flows generated by the securitized assets are inadequate to service the obligations of the qspe 
additional information pertaining to our securitization transactions and related retained interests is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein

we are subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators in january these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i and total capital ratios meet or exceed and  respectively  are deemed to be well capitalized 
at december   the bank s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december the following table compares east west bancorp  inc s and east west bank s actual capital ratios at december   to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes table regulatory required ratios minimum well east west east west regulatory capitalized bancorp bank requirements requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  and advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced net cash inflows of million and million  respectively  from operating activities 
net cash inflows from operating activities during and were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled billion and billion during and  respectively 
net cash outflows from investing activities for both periods can be attributed primarily to the substantial growth in our loan portfolio and purchases of available for sale securities 
these activities were partially offset by repayments  maturities  redemptions and net sales proceeds from investment securities available for sale 
we experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of billion and billion during and  respectively 
deposit growth  proceeds from repurchase agreements  and proceeds from long term debt  partially offset by a decrease in fhlb advances and dividends paid on the company s common stock accounted for the net cash inflows from financing activities during during  net cash inflows can be attributed largely to deposit growth  a net increase in fhlb advances  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and long term debt in private placement transactions  partially offset by dividends paid on common stock 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have established federal funds lines with six correspondent banks and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
at december   the company s available borrowing capacity includes million in federal funds line facilities  million in repurchase arrangements and billion in unused fhlb advances 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our operating needs and other cash commitments 
at december   we were not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
for the years ended december  and  total dividends paid by the bank to east west bancorp  inc amounted to million and million  respectively 
as of december   approximately million of undivided profits of the bank were available for dividends to the company 
interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
although in the normal course of business we manage other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  we consider interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a monthly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a parallel shift of to basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income net portfolio value volatility volatility change in interest rates december  december  december  december  basis points the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to published indices 
the following tables provide the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments 
table expected maturity for financial instruments expected maturity or repricing date by year fair value at after december  total dollars in thousands assets securities purchased under resale agreements weighted average rate investment securities available for sale fixed rate weighted average rate investment securities available for sale variable rate weighted average rate total gross loans weighted average rate liabilities checking accounts weighted average rate money market accounts weighted average rate savings deposits weighted average rate time deposits weighted average rate federal funds purchased weighted average rate fhlb advances weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements weighted average rate subordinated debt weighted average rate junior subordinated debt weighted average rate fixed rate junior subordinated debt weighted average rate variable rate expected maturities of assets are contractual maturities adjusted for projected payment based on contractual amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal as well as repricing frequency 
expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates and changes in pricing for deposits with no stated maturity dates 
we utilize assumptions supported by documented analyses for the expected maturities of our loans and repricing of our deposits 
we also rely on third party data providers for prepayment projections for amortizing securities 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary significantly if future prepayments and repricing differ from our expectations based on historical experience 
the fair values of short term investments approximate their book values due to their short maturities 
for securities purchased under resale agreements  fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates 
bid quotations from securities brokers or third party data providers are the basis for fair values of investment securities available for sale 
the fair values of loans are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics and takes into consideration discounted cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates as projected by third party data providers 
transaction deposit accounts  which include checking  money market and savings accounts  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these accounts are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair values of time deposits are based upon the discounted values of contractual cash flows  which are estimated using current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining terms 
for federal funds purchased  fair value approximates book value due to their short maturities 
the fair value of fhlb advances is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next repricing date based on current rates offered by the fhlb for borrowings with similar maturities 
the fair values of securities sold under repurchase agreements are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates  utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
for both subordinated and junior subordinated debt instruments  fair values are estimated by discounting cash flows through maturity based on current market rates 
the asset liability committee is authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
we sometimes use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
the use of derivatives has not had a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in august and november  we entered into four equity swap agreements with a major investment brokerage firm to hedge against market fluctuations in a promotional equity index certificate of deposit product that we offered to bank customers for a limited time during the latter half of this product  which has a term of years  pays interest based on the performance of the hang seng china enterprises index  or the hscei 
the combined notional amounts of the equity swap agreements total million with termination dates similar to the stated maturity date on the underlying certificate of deposit host contracts 
for the equity swap agreements  we agreed to pay interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis and receive any increase in the hscei at swap termination date 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  a certificate of deposit that pays interest based on changes in an equity index is a hybrid instrument with an embedded derivative ie equity call option that must be accounted for separately from the host contract ie the certificate of deposit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 both the embedded equity call options on the certificates of deposit and the freestanding equity swap agreements are marked to market every month with resulting changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
on april   the company amended the four equity swap agreements entered into in effectively removing the swap payable leg 
the amendments to the swap agreements changed the terms of the agreements such that instead of paying interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis for the remaining terms of the agreements  we prepaid this amount based on the current market value of the cash streams 
the total amount paid in conjunction with these swap agreement amendments was million on april  the fair value of the embedded derivatives amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively  and is included in interest bearing deposits on the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the equity swap agreements totaled million and thousand as of december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the equity swap agreements and embedded equity call options are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the change in value of the hscei based upon the life of the individual swap agreement
