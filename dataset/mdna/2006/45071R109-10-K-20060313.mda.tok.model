item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k and in conjunction with the risk factors included in item a of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of performance test systems for ip based infrastructure and services that allow our customers to test and measure the performance  functionality  and conformance of internet protocol ip equipment and networks  and the applications that run over them

customers also use our performance applications to test and verify web  internet  security  and business applications 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our net revenues by principal product category in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  product category in thousands  except percentages ethernet sonet software chassis and other total over the last three years  revenues from ethernet interface cards have experienced the largest increase in dollar terms 
generally  ethernet interface cards are used to test equipment that is used at the edge of the internet and in enterprise applications  where demand has been consistently increasing over the last three years 
revenues for sonet interface cards  while increasing slightly in dollar terms  have declined as a percentage of net revenues since looking forward  we expect demand for our ethernet interface cards to remain strong and we expect demand for our sonet interface cards to remain consistent with our historical experience and decrease as a percentage of net revenues 
over the same time period  software revenues have increased both in dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues 
this increase in software revenues is the result of our strategy to use specialized software applications to drive demand for our proprietary hardware platform 
we expect software revenues to continue to increase both in dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues 
sales to our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately million or of our net revenues in  million or of our net revenues in and million or of our net revenues in in addition  to date  we have sold our products primarily to network equipment manufacturers 
while we expect that we will continue to have customer concentration for the foreseeable future  we continue to sell 
table of contents our products to a wide variety of customers and  to the extent we develop a broader and more diverse customer base  our reliance on any one customer may diminish 
net revenues 
our revenues consist primarily of hardware and software product sales 
in some instances our software products are installed and run on other companies hardware 
at other times  software products are installed on our hardware products and are an integral part of the functionality of the hardware 
as such  we apply the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
our products are fully functional at the time of shipment and do not require significant production  modification or customization 
as such  revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  title and risk of loss have transferred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is deemed probable 
when a sale involves multiple elements typically sales of products that include warranty support and services  the entire sales price of the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value in accordance with sop we determine vsoe based on sales prices charged to customers when the same element is sold separately or based upon renewal pricing 
revenue is recognized on multiple element arrangements as each element is delivered  provided the other revenue recognition criteria noted above have also been met 
warranty support and service revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
we use distributors to complement our direct sales and marketing efforts in certain international markets 
due to the broad range of features and options available with our hardware and software products  distributors generally do not stock our products and typically place orders with us after receiving an order from an end customer 
these distributors receive business terms of sale generally similar to those received by our other customers 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues includes materials  payments to third party manufacturers  salaries and other expenses related to manufacturing and technical support personnel  and the warranty cost of hardware to be replaced during the warranty period  which is typically one year 
we outsource the majority of our manufacturing operations  and we conduct final assembly  supply chain management  quality assurance  documentation control and shipping at our facility in calabasas  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
cost of revenues also includes royalties and amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions of certain product lines and technologies 
gross margins 
gross margins of our various interface cards and software products have generally been consistent and have exceeded the gross margins of our chassis 
in general  our gross margins are primarily affected by the following factors changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  the pricing we are able to obtain from our component suppliers and contract manufacturers  the mix of our products sold  including the mix of software versus hardware sales  new product introductions by us and by our competitors  demand for our products  expenses related to acquired technologies  such as royalties and amortization of intangible assets  production volume  and the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold 
in the near term  we anticipate gross margins as a percentage of net revenues to remain relatively consistent  except as impacted as a result of the january  adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r see additional information in the critical accounting policies and estimates and 
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements sections below  and as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses 
we generally recognize our operating expenses as we incur them in four major operational categories research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and amortization of intangible assets 
in the near term  we expect total operating expenses to increase in dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues as we seek to attain our strategic product development objectives  meet changing customer requirements and technological advances  enlarge our direct sales force  expand our administrative infrastructure  and due to an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of the january  adoption of sfas r 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel costs related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we also capitalize and depreciate over a five year period costs of our products used for internal purposes 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in direct sales  sales support and marketing functions  as well as promotional and advertising expenditures 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  human resources  information technology and administrative personnel  as well as recruiting and professional fees  insurance costs and other general corporate expenses 
amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of the purchase price of the various intangible assets over their useful lives 
periodically we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value in the period that the impairment circumstances occurred 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net represents interest on cash and a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  and government  federal agency and corporate debt securities  and certain foreign currency gains and losses 
income tax 
income tax expense is determined based on the amount of earnings and enacted federal  state and foreign tax rates  adjusted for allowable credits and the effects of equity compensation plans 
as a result of adopting sfas r  we expect our effective tax rate to increase in the near term 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  write downs for obsolete inventory  deferred taxes  acquisition purchase price allocation  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation expense  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
we recognize revenue as discussed in net revenues in the overview section of item 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience  current customer information and other relevant data 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances of days and over are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
write down of obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand is less favorable than our initial estimate  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
acquisition purchase price allocation 
when we acquire a business  product line or rights to a product or technology  we allocate the purchase price  including related transaction costs  to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
to assist in this process  we may obtain appraisals from valuation specialists for certain of these items 
most of the assumptions used to determine fair value are made based on forecasted information 
the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for reasonableness periodically by management in light of current conditions 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable definite life intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas which generally requires that we assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
to the extent that the estimated undiscounted cash flows fall below the carrying value of the intangible or other long lived assets we write down the assets to fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on discounted cash flows 
determining the fair value based on discounted cash flows is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about future results and discount rates 
we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill in accordance with sfas which requires us to assess our goodwill annually for impairment 
impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value 
stock based compensation expense for and thereafter 
effective january   we adopted sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective fair values for accounting purposes on the grant date 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments which meets the requirements of sfas r 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life and risk free interest rate 
the expected life and expected volatility are based on historical and other data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements in and thereafter 
table of contents will be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the amount of stock based compensation expense in and thereafter will be reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience as well as future expectations 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a periodic basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees  our stock based compensation expense will increase by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those grants 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have been similar to the current pro forma disclosures required under sfas see note to our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities  including threatened or pending litigation  in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  and we record accruals when the loss is deemed probable and the liability can reasonably be estimated 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances of each situation and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to 
table of contents employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective fair values for accounting purposes on the grant date 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
given that we have historically granted a significant amount of stock options to employees  the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we will adopt the modified prospective transition method and continue to use the black scholes fair value model  where applicable 
in addition  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have been similar to the current pro forma disclosures required under sfas we adopted sfas r effective january  in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
the statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable 
the statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will apply the requirements of sfas on any changes in principle made on or after january  in october  fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no

the guidance in this fsp is effective after november  we may take up to one year from the later of adoption of sfas r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election

the impairment is other than temporary for equity securities and debt securities that can contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the investor would not recover substantially all of its cost

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to maintain the safety of principal and preserve liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government debt securities  corporate debt securities  auction rate securities and money market funds 
we do not use any derivatives or similar instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
we intend and have the ability to hold these securities to maturity and  therefore  we would not expect our consolidated operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from the levels as of december   the decline in the fair market value of the portfolio would not be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
exchange rate sensitivity the majority of our revenue and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
however  since we have sales and development operations outside of the united states  we do have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  romanian lei  indian rupee and british pound 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain accounts receivable amounts that are denominated in japanese yen 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recorded immediately in earnings 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes and we do not expect net gains or losses on these derivative instruments to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
