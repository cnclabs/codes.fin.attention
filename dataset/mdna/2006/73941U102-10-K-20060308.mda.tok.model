item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused primarily on products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and other pain related conditions 
our product development emphasis is on diseases with unmet medical needs where we can improve efficacy  safety and or patient convenience 
since our inception  we have focused our efforts primarily on the development or regulatory approval of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of migraine 
since inception  our business activities have included product candidate research and development  designing and conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  regulatory and clinical affairs  intellectual property prosecution and expansion  and business development  including product acquisition and or licensing and collaboration activities 
we are currently developing trexima in collaboration with gsk 
trexima is the proposed brand name for the combination of sumatriptan succinate  formulated with gsk s rt technology tm  and naproxen sodium in a single tablet designed for the treatment of migraine 
we have received marketing authorization in the uk from the mhra for our other migraine product candidate  mt  a combination of metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium 
we have not obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in the us we are also exploring the development of product candidates in other pain and pain related therapeutic areas under our pn pa and lornoxicam development programs described below 
we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock  our initial public offering and  beginning in  payments received under our collaborations 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from initial payments received under our collaboration agreements 
we currently have collaboration agreements with gsk for the development and commercialization in the us of proprietary combinations of one or more of gsk s triptans and a long acting nsaid  and with valeant na for the further development and commercialization of mt in the us we also have entered into a development and license agreement with nycomed  pursuant to which we have licensed certain rights to develop and commercialize products containing lornoxicam 
we plan to continue to seek additional partnering opportunities to commercialize our product candidates 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not generated any revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for our product candidates mt  mt and trexima  research and development costs associated with our exploratory programs and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for personnel involved in our research and development activities and direct development costs  which include costs relating to the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  costs relating to preclinical studies  including toxicology studies  and clinical trials  and costs relating to compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the development of our product candidates 
since inception  our research and development expenses have represented of our total operating expenses 
for the year ended december   our research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises  states that an enterprise shall be considered to be in the development stage if either planned principal operations have not commenced or planned principal operations have commenced  but there has been no significant revenue therefrom 
we will remain a development stage company until such time as significant revenues have been generated from the marketing and sale of our product candidates 

table of contents we expect that we may continue to incur operating losses over the next several years as we complete the development and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates  develop other product candidates and acquire and develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including the progress of trexima and our other product candidates in the clinical and regulatory process  the establishment of new collaborations and progress of our existing collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  the acquisition and or in licensing  and development  of other therapeutic product candidates  and our costs related to the class action lawsuit that is pending against us and our president and chief executive officer relating to the approvability of mt and mt the status of this lawsuit is discussed under item legal proceedings herein 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to achieve the milestones set forth in our collaboration agreements and successfully develop our migraine and other product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and commercialize our future products 
status and expenses related to our product candidates there follows a brief discussion of the status of the development of our product candidates  as well as the costs relating to our development activities 
our direct research and development expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  our research and development expenses that are not direct development costs consist of personnel and other research and development departmental costs and are not allocated by product candidate 
we do not maintain records that allocate our employees time by the projects on which they work and  therefore  are unable to identify costs related to the time that employees spend on research and development by product candidate 
total compensation and benefit costs for our personnel involved in research and development were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  other research and development department costs were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  trexima 
in may  we commenced a phase clinical program for trexima 
as part of the phase program  we have completed two phase pivotal trials designed to determine the effectiveness and safety of trexima for the acute treatment of migraine as well as to satisfy the requirements of the fda s combination drug rule 
in addition  we conducted a long term  open label safety study 
along with these program trials  gsk has funded and continues to conduct pre approval market support studies for trexima under our ind 
we filed an nda for trexima in august and the fda accepted it for review in october upon the fda s acceptance for review of the nda  we received a million milestone payment from our partner gsk 
we anticipate receiving an action letter on the nda from the fda in june we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of costs necessary to complete the development of trexima or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from trexima 
the additional costs that we may incur include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities associated with the packaging and labeling of our product and the cost and timing of regulatory approvals 
we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt trexima of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
pn pa program 
we currently have two pn product candidates in development under this development program pn  a combination of lansoprazole and naproxen  and pn  a combination of omeprazole and naproxen 
a third product candidate  pa  a combination of a ppi and aspirin  is currently in formulation development 
based on our discussions with the fda during relating to the development plans for our pn product candidates  we believe we should be able to initiate phase studies for our pn product candidates in mid we currently plan to take only one pn product candidate into phase in we also had discussions with the fda concerning the implications of the fda s guidance concerning labeling of nsaid containing products issued in june as a result of an fda advisory committee meeting held in february to address the safety of nsaids and  in particular  the cardiovascular risks of cox selective nsaids 
based on those discussions  we believe that long term cardiovascular safety studies may not be required at this time for fda approval of our pn product candidates containing naproxen 
we will continue to evaluate and review with the fda its expectations and recommendations regarding the efficacy and safety requirements and study design necessary to support approval of ndas for our pn and pa product candidates 

table of contents we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pn pa program of million for the fiscal year ended december  and million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation or our overhead expenses 
lornoxicam program 
we are exploring the development of novel product candidates containing lornoxicam  alone or in combination with other active ingredients  as potential treatments for pain or other indications 
we are conducting our exploratory work under an exclusive license agreement with nycomed granting to us certain rights to develop and commercialize products containing lornoxicam 
in december  we submitted an ind to the fda for lornoxicam oral tablets and  in january  received fda approval to conduct the first human study with this formulation in the united states 
the data from this study confirmed the acute safety profile for lornoxicam in these patients and provided preliminary evidence of efficacy in this pain model 
as a result of the fda advisory committee meeting held in february addressing the potential cardiovascular risk of cox selective nsaids and related drugs  the fda has indicated that long term cardiovascular safety studies will be required prior to nda approval of new nsaid products that may be used on an intermittent or chronic basis  such as our lornoxicam oral tablet product candidate 
in may  we submitted an ind to the fda for an injectable lornoxicam formulation and  in june  received fda approval to conduct the first human study with this formulation under our ind 
phase studies have been initiated for this injectable formulation  and we commenced phase studies in two pain models  bunionectomy and migraine  in december it is anticipated that the injectable formulation will be studied in the management of moderate to severe acute pain in the clinical setting and as such  we believe  based on our discussions with the fda  that long term cardiovascular safety studies may not be required for nda approval of this formulation 
however  we cannot guarantee that such studies will not be required 
we will continue to evaluate and discuss with the fda the clinical and non clinical study requirements  including safety study requirements  anticipated for approval of our lornoxicam product candidates 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any lornoxicam product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any lornoxicam products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our lornoxicam program of million for the fiscal year ended december  and million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation or our overhead expenses 
mt in may  we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda for mt  which we had filed in july in september  after an fda advisory committee concluded that the potential risk of tardive dyskinesia associated with the use of metoclopramide  one of the components of mt  outweighed the risks of the mt combination  we decided to discontinue further development of mt in the us in november  we received notification that the mhra had granted us marketing approval for mt in the uk  based on our maa for mt submitted in to the mhra 
we are exploring the possibility of selling or otherwise disposing of the mt asset 
we are not currently conducting and do not plan to conduct any clinical trials for mt and do not expect to incur any additional significant development costs related to mt we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
mt in december  we submitted to the fda an nda for approval of mt in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda for mt subsequently  we submitted additional responses to the not approvable letter and continued our communications with the fda relative to the nda 
based on our most recent discussions with the fda  and our understanding of the current fda standards for approval of migraine drugs  we believe it is not possible to reverse the not approvable status of the nda for mt we are not currently conducting any clinical trials for mt given our current assessment that we do not believe we can reverse the not approvable status of the nda  we believe that we will not receive cash inflows from mt the additional costs that we may incur include expenses relating to clinical trials  formulation  manufacturing and labeling of our product and regulatory consulting expenses required to address the fda s response to our application 

table of contents we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the us in the preparation of our financial statements 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure about these policies  have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we have historically discussed and continue to discuss three critical accounting estimates revenue recognition  accrued expenses and income taxes 
revenue recognition our licensing and other collaborative agreements have terms that include up front payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development are reached  royalty payments based on future product sales and withdrawal fees if certain conditions are met 
we recognize revenue under these agreements in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition as amended by sab revenue recognition sab  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under sab recognition of revenue from non refundable up front payments is deferred by us upon receipt and recognized over the period ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
if regulatory approvals or other events relating to our product candidates are accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for these products would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones if i the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii the fees are non refundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when both criteria are met 
we have not previously received royalty revenue but we anticipate such revenue will be recognized related to the manufacture  sale or use of our products or technology 
for those arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  we will recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjust for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
additionally  our licensing agreements may include payment for services provided by us on an hourly rate and direct expenses 
we record such revenue in accordance with the agreements which would generally be based upon time spent and materials used on the project 
management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the periods for revenue recognition described above are appropriate  and historical changes in our estimates of these periods have not resulted in material changes in the revenue we recognized 
however  we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
further  if regulatory approval for trexima is accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for this product would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
as of december   we had deferred million of revenue  of which million is refundable under certain termination or cancellation provisions within our licensing agreements 
we recognized revenue related to our collaborations of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  accrued expenses  including contracted costs significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with accrued expenses  including those related to contract costs  such as costs associated with our clinical trials 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
management analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and toxicology and related activities  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
material differences in the amount and timing of the accrued liability for any period may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 

table of contents our management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate accrued expenses for the period are appropriate 
however  determining the date on which certain contract services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services involves subjective judgments and often must be based upon information provided by third parties 
in the event that we do not identify certain contract costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported accrued expenses for such period would be too low or too high  as the case may be 
we recognized accrued costs related to product development and operating activities  including clinical trials  based upon the progress of these activities covered by the related contracts  invoices received and estimated costs  of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  the variance  at each of these ending periods  between the actual expenses incurred and the expenses accrued has been less than  income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish an annual valuation allowance 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the fiscal years ended december    or and have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or more periods 
until we record a tax provision or benefit based upon anticipated utilization of the prior operating loss carry forwards  no estimate of the effect of a change in our estimated effective tax rate will be made 
historical results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income loss per share net income attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended december  was million or per share basic and diluted  as compared to net loss of million  or per share  for the fiscal year ended december  revenue we recognized million of revenue for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  revenue for the periods resulted from amortization of upfront payments and other payments we received pursuant to development and commercialization agreements relating to mt  mt and trexima 
revenue for the year ended december  included a milestone payment of million from gsk for acceptance of the trexima nda by the fda in october revenue for the year ended december  included milestone payments from gsk of million we received at the commencement of trexima phase clinical trial activities and million we received for conducting trexima phase clinical trial activities 
our licensing and collaboration agreements have terms that include upfront payments upon contract signing and additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product development or related milestones are achieved 
all upfront payments were deferred and the non refundable portions are being amortized over the periods ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates  or the conclusion of any obligation on our part 
approximately million remains in deferred revenue at december  substantive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon completion of the contractual events 
research and development research and development expenses decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the fiscal year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in direct development costs for trexima  partially offset by an increase in costs for the pn development program and increases in personnel costs 
direct development costs for trexima decreased by million to million primarily due to a decrease in phase clinical trial activities during  as compared to the same period of direct development costs for the pn development program increased by million to million primarily due to increased product development activities during as compared to the same period of research and development personnel costs increased million to million as compared to the same period of  primarily due to an increase in personnel and related expenses 
we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs associated with our research and development activities and costs associated with pharmaceutical development  clinical trials  toxicology activities  and regulatory matters 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the costs associated with our public company activities 
costs associated with our public company activities increased by million to million  primarily due to increases in directors and officers insurance  and increases in other consulting related costs  including auditing related activities 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the costs of administrative personnel  facility infrastructure  business development expenses and public company activities 
other income interest income was million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  investment income from bond amortization for the fiscal year ended december  totaled million as compared to no investment income from bond amortization during the fiscal year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income loss per share net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended december  was million or per share basic and diluted  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the fiscal year ended december  revenue we recognized million of licensing revenue for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the million increase resulted from the amortization of upfront payments we received in pursuant to development and commercialization agreements relating to mt  mt and mt  from a million milestone payment we received from gsk at the commencement of trexima phase clinical trial activities in the second quarter of and from a million payment from gsk for conducting trexima phase clinical trial activities in the fourth quarter of our license agreements have terms that include upfront payments upon contract signing and additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product development or related milestones are achieved 
all upfront payments were deferred and are being amortized over the periods ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
approximately million remained in deferred revenue at december  substantive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon completion of the contractual events 
research and development research and development expenses increased by to million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the million increase was due primarily to an increase in direct development costs for trexima and our exploratory programs  and other departmental expenses  offset by a decrease in direct development costs associated with mt and mt direct development costs associated with trexima increased by million to million  primarily due to phase clinical trial activities during  as compared to the same period of direct development costs associated with our exploratory programs increased by million to million  primarily due to phase clinical trial activities for our lornoxicam program and pharmaceutical development activities for the lornoxicam and our other exploratory programs during  as compared to mt direct development costs decreased by million to million  primarily due to costs incurred in preparing and filing an nda with the fda in  as compared to the same period of direct development costs associated with mt decreased by million to million  primarily due to mt product supply expenses incurred during as compared to the same period of research and development departmental expenses increased by million to million  primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs associated with our product development activities and legal and consulting costs incurred for mt and mt regulatory activities 
we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs associated with our research and development activities and costs associated with pharmaceutical development  clinical trials  toxicology activities  and regulatory matters 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the million decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the costs associated with our business development activities and personnel related expenses offset by an increase in costs related to our public company activities 
business development expenses decreased by million to million  primarily due to a greater level of pre commercialization activities for mt and mt in  as compared to the same period of administrative expenses decreased by million to million in  as compared to the period  primarily due to the payment of million for incentive compensation to our chief executive officer in costs associated with our public company activities increased by million to million  primarily due to legal fees associated with the class action litigation pending against us and other professional consulting fees incurred in preparing for sarbanes oxley regulatory compliance 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the costs of administrative personnel  facility infrastructure  business development expenses and public company activities 
interest income interest income increased to million for the fiscal year ended december   from million for the same period of this increase was due to an increase in interest rates and our average cash balance available for investing during  as compared to the same period of 
table of contents income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available  subject to applicable limitations  to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  which expire between and we also have research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes that expire between and we currently estimate a cumulative net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for the twelve months ending december  for income tax purposes and estimate an effective tax rate of for the twelve months ended december  our effective tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december  the estimated effective rate was based upon income for the fiscal year and estimates of our ability to use remaining net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits 
however  the actual effective rate may vary depending upon actual licensing fees and milestone payments received  specifically the pre tax book income for the year  and other factors 
income taxes have been accounted for using the liability method in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the tax reform act of the tax reform act limits the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act  as a result of  among other reasons  past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering  resulting in cash inflows of million  and since  from upfront and milestone payments from our collaborators  resulting in cash inflows of million 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  along with short term investments  totaled million  a decrease of million compared to december  our cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks and short term corporate fixed income obligations and us government agency obligations 
during the first quarter of  we moved million into a managed investment account designed to increase the return on our cash 
this account  which is invested as described above  is managed within our board approved investment policy  which restricts investments to less than twelve months  limits concentration to or less and requires credit ratings of a p  among other requirements 
because certain holdings in the managed account have maturities longer than three months  we have classified these holdings as short term investments in our balance sheet and accounting principles require reporting such investments at market value 
any difference in market value and cost is reported in the stockholder s equity section of our financial statements as comprehensive income or loss 
operating cash received during the twelve month period ended december  totaled million 
the million was a milestone payment received from gsk in october as a result of the fda s acceptance for review of the trexima nda 
we expect additional milestone payments from gsk in the aggregate amount of million upon the approval of the trexima nda and gsk s intent to commercialize trexima 
cash received from financing activities during the period totaled million reflecting net proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
based upon the direct method of presenting cash flow  cash paid for operating activities totaled million for the twelve month period ended december  the indirect method for presenting cash flow is used in the statement of cash flows included in our financial statements 
cash paid for operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  net cash paid for investing activities during the period totaled million  reflecting investing activities associated with the purchase of short term securities 
cash required for our operating activities during is projected to be slightly higher than our requirements due to the expected cash required to continue development of our exploratory programs 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
if our operating expenses for and are at the level of our operating expenses in  and if we do not receive any additional milestone payments under any of our collaboration agreements during and  including in particular million in remaining milestone payments from gsk related to fda approval of and gsk s intent to commercialize trexima  we will not have sufficient cash reserves to maintain our level of business activities throughout further  our expenses might increase in and if any regulatory agency requires us to conduct additional clinical trials  studies or investigations in connection with their consideration  or reconsideration  of our regulatory filings for any of our product candidates 
we are not currently obligated to make any milestone payments to third parties and do not currently have any other required material payment obligations during that period 
however  regulatory delays or unforeseen developments in 
table of contents the development of our existing and future product candidates may increase our cash requirements beyond our currently assumed needs 
in addition  we may be required to pay valeant na a withdrawal fee of million if we do not prevail in our current dispute with them as to whether the withdrawal fee is payable 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may seek to raise additional funds 
sources of such funds may not be available on terms favorable to us 
we regularly assess available funding options and will consider available funding opportunities as they arise 
we may issue shares of common stock in the future  including to fund additional unplanned development activities 
we have filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  and the sec has declared effective  a shelf registration statement on form s under which we may register up to  shares of our common stock for sale in one or more public offerings 
certain selling stockholders named in the prospectus for the registration statement may offer up to an aggregate of  of such shares  and we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sales of shares made by the selling stockholders 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our forecast of the period of time through which we expect that our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  our success in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates and success in  and manner of  commercializing our products  the success of our existing collaborations and our ability to establish additional collaborations  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  technologies or products  costs incurred to enforce and defend our patent claims and other intellectual rights  our ability to negotiate favorable terms with various contractors assisting in our trials and studies  and costs incurred in the defense of the class action lawsuit that is pending against us and our president and chief executive officer relating to mt and mt obligations and commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the expected timing of maturities of those contractual obligations 
this table should be read in conjunction with the notes accompanying our financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
payments due by period contractual obligations total after in thousands operating leases product development agreements total contractual obligations these commitments are associated with operating leases

amounts represent open purchase orders for ongoing pharmaceutical development activities for our product candidates as of december  these agreements may be terminated by us at any time without incurring a termination fee 
recent accounting pronouncements as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fasb  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the revised fasb s fasb r fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of fasb r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fasb r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the notes to our financial statements reflected in item in this annual report on form k 
fasb r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the decrease in operating cash flows which would have been recognized for such excess tax deductions was million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the proceeds from our initial public offering  private placements and revenue from our collaboration agreements have been invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks and short term corporate fixed income obligations and us government and government agency obligations 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio
