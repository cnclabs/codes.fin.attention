narrative description of business the company s operations are classified into four principle industry segments for the fiscal years ended august sales product line industrial wood products lumber  building materials other seed processing and sales industrial tools and clamps income from operations loss product line industrial wood products lumber  building materials other seed processing and sales industrial tools and clamps general corporate identifiable assets product line industrial wood products lumber  building materials other seed processing and sales industrial tools and clamps general corporate major customers fiscal years ended august st us marine greenwood the top ten customers are responsible for fy of total sales 
management believes that the company is in no danger of losing any of its major customers 
industrial wood products greenwood greenwood operates out of leased facilities located in portland  oregon 
this business involves the contract manufacturing and distribution of industrial wood and other specialty building products  principally to original equipment manufacturers  primarily in the transportation and recreational boating industries in the united states 
specific products include proprietary marine panels  yacht grade cherry lumber  db ply sound dampening plywood panels  laminated veneer lumber  one piece lvl stringers  xl industrial panels  select boat panel  and panelam panel 
other products include cheese boxes  kiln sticks  diving board blanks  and scaffolding 
generally  the value added nature of our wood components is engineered to proprietary specifications and tolerances 
some of these products will resist rot  and flame 
they also reduce sound and have a high degree of structural strength per pound 
during fiscal  and  sales revenue by greenwood to original equipment manufacturers represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue  with transportation and recreational boating sales representing in  in and in this market is sensitive to downturns in the u 
s economy 
the competitive environment is a balance of price and quality of the product 
raw materials cost is dependent on petroleum  wood chemical and transportation factors 
inventory is maintained at rental facilities throughout the united states and is shipped to the manufacturers on a just in time basis 
no material portions of our business are subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government 
we have no patents  franchises  or concessions relating to any of our products and as a result they are not factors in our business 
greenwood has no backlog of orders 
lumber  building materials other jclc jclc operates out of owned facilities located in north plains  oregon 
our wood products are grouped into fencing  dimension lumber  building materials and other wood products 
our non wood items include dog kennels  greenhouses  general purpose storage shelters  outdoor gate systems and metal fencing panels 
distribution is handled through our distribution center or direct sales to home improvement centers and other retailers which are located primarily in the pacific region of the united states  the export of finished building materials to customers who are located primarily in central and south america 
jclc also sells specialty wood products for both government and industrial use 
the home improvement business is seasonal  with most of our sales occurring between february and august 
historically we have negotiated an agreement with each of our major home centers in the fall of the year for the company s home improvement season 
inventory buildup occurs until the start of the season in february and then gradually declines to seasonal low levels at the end of the summer 
this area of our business is done primarily on a contract bid basis 
this means that we sell products after we have been told that bids for these products were accepted and we are given a contract which states that our customers will purchase the products from us 
during fiscal  and  sales revenue by jclc to home improvement centers was approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
jclc concentrated on building a customer base in the residential repair and remodeling segment of the home improvement industry 
management believes this is a growth market fueled by professional re modelers and do it yourself homeowners 
this market is less sensitive to downturns in the us economy than is the market for new home construction 
jclc products are seldom unique and with few exceptions are available from multiple suppliers 
jclc competes by offering increased customer service  including bar coding of products  shrink wrapping of individual orders  and  just in time delivery to most customers 
the competitive environment of jclc is a balance between price and availability 
no material portions of our business are subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government 
we have no patents  trademarks  franchises  or concessions relating to any of our products and as a result they are not factors in our business 
jclc has one licensing agreement which covers the licensing of imported products and another which involves the use of a license to market pet products 
backlog orders are not a factor in our business  we only process orders on an as needed basis 
there were no customers from whom jclc derived or more of the company s revenue 
seed processing and sales jcsc jcsc operates out of facilities located in north plains  oregon 
jcsc brings raw  harvested seeds to its facility and processes them so that they become marketable products 
processing means removing imperfect  lightweight  hollow seeds that cannot germinate normally  as well as removing field impurities  weeds  and noxious seed 
jcsc also bags  palletizes  shrink wraps  stores  and subsequently ships the product 
jcsc performs the foregoing services for growers and for themselves in the case where jssc buys the raw product and subsequently sells to third parties 
the business is concentrated in the us northwest where harvest months are june through september 
revenues attributable to jcsc occur throughout the year and are dependent on the timely processing of the raw product 
the competitive environment is a balance of price  timing of processing and weather 
there are no customers from whom we derive or more of the company s revenue 
jcsc has no backlog of orders 
industrial tools and clamps msi this business operates from the same facilities as jclc  importing and distributing both pneumatic air tools and industrial clamps 
we sell these products throughout the united states and canada to distributors and original equipment manufacturer customers 
these sales are made through a network of agents and representatives  each of whom is an independent contractor representing between to other manufacturers who sell to similar customers but are not selling competing lines 
through msi we have agents and representatives that cover major industry groupings including industrial suppliers  automotive suppliers  and woodworking suppliers 
the pneumatic air tools  manufactured and sold under the name msi pro  are of a light industrial application and are moderately priced 
the line of industrial jig and fixture clamps are high quality and moderately priced and covers a wide variety of potential customers 
the market for pneumatic air tools is very competitive 
in this industry  we face competition from better financed companies with more sophisticated sales forces and more sophisticated distribution networks 
the us market for pneumatic air tools is currently approximately billion in annual sales  of which are manufactured in the united states and are imported 
the best known us manufactured lines are chicago pneumatic and ingersoll rand  which rank and in overall size in the industry  a smaller line  sioux  is also manufactured in the united states 
the two largest imported lines today are florida pneumatic and astro tools  others include sunnex  ames  and eagle 
our sales in this industry represent a very small fraction of the market 
the us sales volume in industrial clamps is approximately million annually 
there are fewer competitive lines available and we expect to gain a larger share of the market in industrial clamps than in pneumatic air tools 
our current market strategy that allows us to compete in the pneumatic air tool and industrial clamp markets includes brand name and company recognition  moderate to low price  and continued development of a manufacturer representative organization that covers all of the major users of the tools 
our products have been manufactured for us by several suppliers in taiwan and south korea 
more than one supplier is able to manufacture all of our products 
sales of pneumatic air tools and industrial clamps are not seasonal 
msi pro co 
is a registered trademark in the united states and canada 
msi has no patents  licenses or concessions 
there are no customers from whom msi derives more than of the company s revenue 
employees as of august   we employed approximately employees 
greenwood  jclc  jcsc and msi the company has no labor unions 
our continued success is partly dependent on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
historically  we have had no difficulty attracting qualified personnel to meet our requirements 
item a 
risk factors investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report 
there is a great deal of risk involved 
any of the following risks could affect our business  its financial condition  its potential profits or losses  and could result in you losing your entire investment if our business became insolvent 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  also may result in decreased revenues  increased expenses or other events which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
risks related to our common stock we may decide to acquire assets or enter into business combinations  which could be paid for  either wholly or partially with our common stock and if we decide to do this our current shareholders would experience dilution in their percentage of ownership 
our articles of incorporation give our board of directors the right to enter into any contract without the approval of our shareholders 
therefore  our management could decide to make an investment buy shares  loan money  etc 
without shareholder approval 
if we acquire an asset or enter into a business combination  this could include exchanging a large amount of our common stock  which could dilute the ownership interest of present stockholders 
future stock distributions could be structured in such a way as to be diluting to our current shareholders or could cause a change in control to new investors 
if we raise additional funds by selling more of our stock  the new stock may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our existing stock 
if common stock is issued in return for additional funds  the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current stockholders 
the result of this would be a lessening of each present stockholder s relative percentage interest in our company 
our shareholders could experience significant dilution if we issue our authorized  preferred shares 
we recently registered  common shares with the securities and exchange commission which became effective september   this could result in a substantial proportion of the voting power being transferred to new investor s 
the result would be that the new shareholder s could control our company and persons unknown could replace current management 
we have not established a minimum amount of proceeds that we must receive in the offering before any proceeds may be accepted 
once accepted  the funds will be deposited into an account maintained by us and considered our general assets 
none of the proceeds will be placed in any escrow  trust or other arrangement  therefore  there are no investor protections for the return of subscription funds once accepted 
the company s common shares currently trade within the nasdaq capital market in the united states and on the toronto stock exchange in canada 
the average daily trading volume of our common stock is  shares in the united states and significantly less in canada 
with this limited trading volume  investors could find it difficult to purchase or sell our common stock 
risks related to our business we could experience a decrease in the demand for our products resulting in lower sales volumes  which would give us less capital with which to operate 
in the past we have experienced decreasing annual sales in the areas of home improvement products sold through jclc and industrial tools 
the reasons for this can be generally attributed to increased competition  worldwide economic conditions  specifically those pertaining to lumber prices  demand for industrial tools  and consumer interest rates 
if economic conditions deteriorate or if consumer preferences change  we could experience a significant decrease in profitability 
production time and the overall cost of our products could increase resulting in lower profit margins for our products if any of our primary suppliers are lost or if any of them increased their prices of raw materials 
our manufacturing operation  which includes cutting lumber to specific sizes and shapes  depends upon obtaining adequate supplies of lumber on a timely basis 
if these supplies of lumber were not received on a timely basis  we could experience lower profit margins and possibly lose sales of these products 
if our top customers were lost and could not be replaced 
our top ten customers represent of our business 
we would experience a significant decrease in sales and would have to cut back our operations 
our top ten customers are in the us and are primarily in the marine and retail building industries 
we could experience delays in the delivery of our products to our customers causing us to lose business 
we purchase our products from other vendors and a delay in shipment from these vendors to us could cause significant delays in our delivery to our customers 
this could result in a decrease in sales orders to us and we would experience a loss in profitability 
we could lose our credit agreement and could result in our not being able to pay our creditors 
we have a line of credit with us bank in the amount of million 
we are currently in compliance with the requirements of our existing line of credit 
if we lost this credit it could become impossible to pay some of our creditors on a timely basis 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately  which could harm our business and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  we will be required  beginning in fiscal year  to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our independent registered public accounting firm test and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of such internal controls and publicly attest to such evaluation 
we have not yet prepared any internal plan of action for compliance with the requirements of section or any effectiveness evaluation 
although we believe our internal controls are operating effectively  we cannot guarantee that we will not have any material weaknesses as reported by our independent registered public accounting firm 
compliance with the requirements of section is expected to be expensive and time consuming 
if we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner  or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations
