item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the business our principal businesses are asset management and related research  as well as the development  marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent  high net worth and institutional market segments 
we distribute our investment products and services  which include individually managed accounts  closed end exchange traded funds closed end funds  and open end mutual funds open end funds or mutual funds  to the affluent and high net worth market segments through unaffiliated intermediary firms including broker dealers  commercial banks  affiliates of insurance providers  financial planners  accountants  consultants and investment advisors 
we also provide managed account services  including privately offered partnerships  to several institutional market segments and channels 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from investment advisory fees  which are recognized as services are performed 
these fees are directly related to the market value of the assets we manage 
advisory fee revenues generally will increase with a rise in the level of assets under management 
assets under management will rise through sales of our investment products or through increases in the value of portfolio investments 
assets under management may also increase as a result of reinvestment of distributions from funds and accounts 
fee income generally will decline when assets under management decline  as would occur when the values of fund portfolio investments decrease or when managed account withdrawals or mutual fund redemptions exceed gross sales and reinvestments 
in addition to investment advisory fees  we have two other main sources of operating revenue performance fees and distribution and underwriting revenue 
performance fees are earned when investment performance on certain institutional accounts and hedge funds exceeds a contractual threshold 
these fees are recognized only at the performance measurement date contained in the individual account management agreement 
distribution revenue is earned when certain funds are sold to the public through financial advisors 
correspondingly  distribution revenue will rise and fall with the level of our sales of mutual fund products 
underwriting fees are earned on the initial public offerings of our closed end funds 
the level of underwriting fees earned in any given year will fluctuate depending on the number of new funds offered  the size of the funds offered and the extent to which we participate as a member of the syndicate group underwriting the fund 
also included in distribution and underwriting revenue is munipreferred r and fundpreferred r revenue 
preferred shares of our closed end funds are bought and sold through a secondary market auction 
a participation fee is paid by the fund to the auction participants based on shares traded 
access to the auction must be made through a participating broker 
we offer non participating brokers access to the auctions  for which we earn a portion of the participation fee 
sales of our products  and our profitability  are directly affected by many variables  including investor preferences for equity  fixed income or other investments  the availability and attractiveness of competing products  market performance  continued access to distribution channels  changes in interest rates  inflation  and income tax rates and laws

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations

intangible assets at december   our assets included million of goodwill and million of other definite lived intangible assets 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate market multiples and other assumptions 
we completed the impairment testing of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment to the goodwill recorded in our books and records as of may   the date that we have selected as an annual date 
the recognition of any such impairment would have resulted in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment was determined 
while we believe that our testing was appropriate  the use of different assumptions may result in recognizing some impairment of goodwill in our financial statements

the fair value of these instruments totaled approximately million at december  we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates from the levels at december   would have resulted in a net increase in the fair market value of the open derivatives of million 
there were no such instruments at december  see note derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
equity market sensitivity as discussed above in the interest rate sensitivity section  we invest in certain company sponsored managed investment funds and accounts that invest in a variety of asset classes 
the carrying value of the company s investments in funds and accounts subject to equity price risk is approximately million and million  at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we estimate that a adverse change in equity prices would have resulted in decreases of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of our equity securities 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a corresponding shift in all equity prices 
an adverse movement in the equity price of our holdings in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified as our ability to realize returns on our investment depends on the investees ability to raise additional capital and or derive cash inflows from continuing operations 
inflation our assets are  to a large extent  liquid in nature and therefore not significantly affected by inflation 
however  inflation may result in increases in our expenses  such as employee compensation  advertising and promotional costs  and office occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation  or the expectation thereof  results in rising interest rates or has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and on the value of financial instruments  it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial decline in the value of fixed income or equity investments could adversely affect the net asset value of funds and accounts we manage  which in turn would result in a decline in investment advisory and performance fee revenue
