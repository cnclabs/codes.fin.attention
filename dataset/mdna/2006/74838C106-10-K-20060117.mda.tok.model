item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report and the risk factors information  set forth in item a 
above 
overview we began operations in as a california company making boardshorts for surfers in the united states under a license agreement with the quiksilver brand founders in australia 
our product offering expanded in the s as we grew our distribution channels 
after going public in and purchasing the rights to the quiksilver brand in the united states from our australian licensor  we further expanded our product offerings and began to diversify 
in  we acquired the european licensee of quiksilver and introduced roxy  our surf brand for teenage girls 
we also expanded demographically in the s by adding products for boys  girls  toddlers and men and we introduced our proprietary retail store concept  boardriders clubs  which displays the heritage and products of quiksilver and roxy 
in  we acquired the international quiksilver and roxy trademarks  and in  we acquired our licensees in australia and japan 
in may  we acquired dc shoes to expand our presence in action sports inspired footwear 
brand building has been a key to our growth  and we have always maintained our roots in the boardriding lifestyle 
today our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops  snow shops  skate shops and specialty stores 
in july  we acquired skis rossignol  sa  a wintersports and golf equipment manufacturer 
rossignol offers a full range of wintersports equipment under the rossignol  dynastar  lange  look and kerma brands  and also sells golf products under the cleveland golf and never compromise brands 
the acquisition was effective july  and we included the operations of rossignol in our results beginning on august  in july  we issued million in senior notes that bear a coupon interest rate of and are due april  these senior notes were used to fund a portion of the rossignol purchase price and to refinance certain existing indebtedness 
over the past years  quiksilver has been established as a leading global brand representing the casual  youth lifestyle associated with boardriding sports 
with our acquisition of rossignol  we have added a collection of leading ski equipment brands to our company that we believe will be the foundation for a full range of technical ski apparel  sportswear and accessories 
also  as part of our acquisition of rossignol  we acquired a majority interest in roger cleveland golf company  inc  a leading producer of wedges and golf clubs in the united states 
we believe that our acquisition of rossignol provides us with multiple authentic brands in both snow and golf 
rossignol s technical knowledge  combined with our current lifestyle brands  will enable us to produce and market apparel  equipment  footwear  accessories and related products for consumers in a broad cross section of the outdoor market 
furthermore  we believe the combination of our existing global expertise in branded apparel and footwear  along with rossignol s expertise in branded wintersports equipment  provide us with a diversified platform for continued growth and enhanced operating efficiencies 
our acquisition of rossignol is expected to have a significant impact on our financial results 
our revenues and expenses are expected to increase substantially 
however  our overall profit margins are expected to be negatively impacted because rossignol has historically generated lower profit margins 
table of contents than we have  and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
in addition  rossignol s business has historically been seasonal  with revenues and operating profits generally higher in august through december  which will affect our consolidated quarterly results 
further  as discussed under financial position  capital resources and liquidity below  we will be substantially more leveraged as a result of debt incurred in connection with the acquisition  and we will have an increased amount of capital committed to manufacturing functions 
over the last five years  our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal we operate in the outdoor market of the sporting goods industry in which we design  produce and distribute branded apparel  wintersports and golf equipment  footwear  accessories and related products 
we operate in three geographic segments  the americas  europe and asia pacific 
the americas segment includes revenues primarily from the us and canada 
the european segment includes revenues primarily from western europe 
the asia pacific segment includes revenues primarily from australia  japan  new zealand and indonesia 
royalties earned from various licensees in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations along with revenues from sourcing services for our licensees 
revenues by segment are as follows years ended october  in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate operations total revenues  net 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain our consumer loyalty  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  engineers  technicians  researchers  merchandisers  pattern makers  and contractors 
our team and the heritage and current strength of our brands has helped us remain competitive in our markets 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are acceptable to the marketplace and competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  technical specifications  distribution methods  price  customer service  and intellectual property protection

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our total net revenues increased in fiscal to  million from  million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales  new products and the rossignol acquisition 
revenues in the americas increased  european revenues increased  and asia pacific revenues increased 
we completed the acquisition of rossignol effective july   and rossignol s operations are included in our results since august  rossignol operates in all three of our geographic segments  primarily producing wintersports and golf equipment  and accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue growth during fiscal we acquired dc shoes  inc at the beginning of our third quarter in fiscal  and the inclusion of dc for the full year of fiscal compared to just six months in fiscal accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue growth during fiscal net revenues in the americas were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal americas net revenues in our men s category  which includes the quiksilver young men s  boys  toddlers  quiksilveredition  dc  and hawk brands  increased to million in fiscal from million the year before 
americas revenues in our women s category  which includes the roxy  roxy girl  teenie wahine  dc  raisins  leilani and radio fiji brands  increased to million from million for those same periods

the women s increase came primarily from the roxy division and  to a lesser extent  the dc division 
the increase in wintersports and golf equipment revenue was primarily due to the newly acquired rossignol business 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts are resulting in increased consumer demand for products in our men s and women s categories in the americas 
european net revenues were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  revenues in the men s category increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year

for consolidated financial statement reporting  euro results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates  but this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
to understand our european fiscal growth and better assess competitive performance  we believe it is important to look at revenues in euros as well  which is our functional currency in europe 
in euros  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer euros on average in fiscal compared to fiscal asia pacific net revenues were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  asia pacific net revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
the increase came primarily from the roxy division and  to a lesser extent  the quiksilver and dc divisions 
for consolidated financial statement reporting  australian dollar results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates  but as with our european segment  this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
in australian dollars  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer australian dollars on average in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin decreased basis points to in fiscal from in the previous year 
the gross profit margin in the americas decreased to from  our european gross profit margin increased to from  and our asia pacific gross profit margin increased to from 
the decrease in the americas gross profit margin was primarily due to lower margins on in season business during the first six months of the current fiscal year in comparison to the prior year and  to a lesser extent  the impact of the newly acquired rossignol business  which produced a lower gross margin than our other businesses during the last three months of fiscal these decreases were partially offset by generating a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores 
we 
table of contents earn higher gross margins on sales in company owned stores  but these higher gross margins are generally offset by store operating costs 
our european gross profit margin increased due to lower production costs resulting from a stronger euro in relation to the us dollar compared to the prior year and  to a lesser extent  a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores  but these increases were substantially offset by the impact of the lower margins from the newly acquired rossignol business 
in asia pacific  the gross profit margin increased primarily due to lower production costs resulting from a stronger australian dollar in relation to the us dollar compared to the prior year and  to a lesser extent  a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal in the americas  these expenses increased to million from million  in europe it increased to million from million  and in asia pacific it increased to million from million for those same periods 
the increase among all three segments was primarily due to the newly acquired rossignol business  additional company owned retail stores  the inclusion of dc for the full year of fiscal compared to just six months of fiscal  additional marketing and other expenses related to increased sales volume 
as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expense remained consistent at of revenues for and the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues due to additional company owned retail stores and increased marketing activities was offset by general leverage on growth 
non operating expenses interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of debt incurred and assumed in connection with the acquisition of rossignol 
we had a foreign currency gain of million in fiscal compared to a foreign currency loss of million in fiscal this gain resulted primarily from the foreign currency contracts that we used to mitigate the risk of translating the results of our international subsidiaries into us dollars 
our income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily because a higher percentage of our fiscal profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates 
net income and ebitda net income in fiscal increased to million  and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased to 
ebitda increased in fiscal to million 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total net revenues increased in fiscal to  million from million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales  new products and the dc acquisition

as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to new company owned retail stores and increased marketing activities 
non operating expenses interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of decreased debt levels and lower interest rates in europe and in the americas 
foreign currency loss increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was caused primarily by the increasing effect of the declining value of the us dollar during fiscal compared to the euro and australian dollar 
these foreign currency losses were substantially offset by higher operating profit in our international divisions resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

net income and ebitda net income in fiscal increased to million  and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased to 
ebitda increased in fiscal to million 
financial position  capital resources and liquidity we generally finance our working capital needs and capital investments with operating cash flows and bank revolving lines of credit 
multiple banks in the united states  europe and australia make these lines of credit available to us 
term loans are also used to supplement these lines of credit and are typically used to finance long term assets 
in july  we issued million in senior notes to fund a portion of the rossignol purchase price and to refinance certain existing indebtedness 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  versus million at october  working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october   an increase of 
we believe that our current cash balances  cash flows and credit facilities are adequate to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  we believe that increases in our credit facilities can be obtained if needed to fund future growth 
operating cash flows we used million of cash in our operating activities in fiscal compared to cash generated of million in fiscal this million decrease in cash provided was primarily caused by an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in inventories  net of accounts payable 
we acquired rossignol effective july  just prior to the season when demand for wintersports equipment is the highest 
accordingly  there was a significant increase in accounts receivable related to revenues from the sale of these products 
accounts receivable also increased  but to a lesser extent  as revenues from our other businesses grew compared to the previous year 
during fiscal  the increase in accounts receivable used cash of million compared to million the year before  a decrease in cash provided of million 
the decrease in inventories  net of accounts payable  generated cash of million in fiscal compared to million the year before  an increase in cash provided of million 
cash provided by net income adjusted for non cash expenses increased million compared to the year before  which more than offset the decrease in cash provided by other working capital components of million  resulting in a net increase in cash provided of million related to these items 
we generated million of cash from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million increase was primarily caused by an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in inventories  which together provided million of cash in fiscal compared to using million the year before 
in addition to this million improvement  operating cash flow also increased by million due to higher net income adjusted for noncash expenses 
increases in accounts receivable offset by changes in other working capital components also generated million of additional cash compared to the year before 
capital expenditures we have historically avoided high levels of capital expenditures for our manufacturing functions by using independent contractors for sewing and other processes such as washing  dyeing and embroidery 
we perform the cutting process in house for certain product categories in the americas to enhance control and efficiency  and we screenprint a portion of our product in house in both the americas and in europe 
the acquisition of rossignol is expected to increase our future capital expenditures for manufacturing functions 
fiscal capital expenditures were million  which was approximately million higher than the million we spent in fiscal in fiscal  we increased our investment in company owned retail stores  warehouse equipment and computer systems 
new company owned retail stores are again part of our plans in fiscal computer hardware and software will also be added to continuously improve systems 
capital spending for these and other projects in fiscal is expected to range between million and million  depending on the pace of our retail expansion 
in addition  the integration of rossignol is expected to result in other investments in facilities 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures primarily from our operating cash flows and our credit facilities 
acquisitions effective july   we acquired rossignol  a wintersports and golf equipment manufacturer 
we have included the operations of rossignol in our results since august  the purchase price  excluding transaction costs  included cash of approximately million  approximately million restricted shares of our common stock  valued at million  a deferred purchase price obligation of approximately million  a liability of approximately million for the mandatory purchase of approximately million outstanding public shares of rossignol representing less than of the share capital of rossignol  and a liability of approximately million for the estimated fair value of million fully vested rossignol stock options 
the deferred purchase price obligation is denominated in euros  and 
table of contents a weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro would cause the actual obligation to be greater 
conversely  a strengthening of the us dollar in relation the euro would cause the actual obligation to be lower 
transaction costs totaled approximately million 
the valuation of the common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was based on its quoted market price for days before and after the announcement date  discounted to reflect the estimated effect of its trading restrictions 
the deferred purchase price obligation is expected to be paid in and will accrue interest equal to the month euro interbank offered rate euribor plus currently 
since we obtained over of the outstanding shares of rossignol through a combination of share purchases  including a public tender offer  a mandatory purchase of the remaining rossignol shares was required under french law 
we completed the purchase of these shares in the quarter ended october  upon the future exercise of the rossignol stock options  we will purchase the resulting issued shares from the rossignol stock option holders 
we acquired a majority interest in cleveland golf when we acquired rossignol  but certain former owners of cleveland golf retained a minority interest of 
we have entered into a put call arrangement with these minority owners whereby they can require us to buy all of their interest in cleveland golf after years and we can buy their interest at our option after years  each at a purchase price generally determined by reference to a multiple of cleveland golf s annual profits and our price earnings ratio 
in connection with the acquisition of rossignol  we have formulated the rossignol integration plan the plan 
the plan covers the global operations of rossignol and our existing businesses  and it includes the evaluation of facility relocations  nonstrategic business activities  redundant functions and other related items 
we have not finalized the plan  but as of october  we had recognized million of liabilities related to the plan  including employee relocation and severance costs  moving costs  and other costs related primarily to the consolidation of rossignol s administrative headquarters in europe and the relocation of our wintersports equipment sales and distribution operations in the united states 
costs that are not associated with rossignol but relate to activities or employees of our existing operations will be charged to earnings as incurred 
certain facilities owned by rossignol are expected to be sold in connection with the plan  while others are anticipated to be refinanced through sale leaseback arrangements 
assets currently held for sale  primarily in the united states and france  totaled approximately million at october  the plan has not been finalized as it relates to facilities outside of the united states  and our estimates of expected costs related to the us aspects of the plan may change 
accordingly  as uncertainties related to the plan are resolved  additional liabilities related to facility relocations  the elimination of nonstrategic business activities and redundant functions  and other related costs could be recognized 
these uncertainties are expected to be resolved within one year of the consummation date of the acquisition  and when determined  additional liabilities could be significant and would be recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
if we have overestimated these costs  the excess will reduce goodwill in future periods 
conversely  if we have underestimated these costs  additional liabilities recognized more than one year after the consummation date of the acquisition will be recorded in earnings 
effective may   we acquired dc 
the initial purchase price  excluding transaction costs  included cash of approximately million  million restricted shares of our common stock  valued at million  and the repayment of approximately million in funded indebtedness 
transaction costs totaled million 
of the initial purchase price  million was paid in fiscal  million was paid during fiscal  and million is expected to be paid based on the resolution of certain remaining contingencies 
the sellers also received million during fiscal  and we have accrued an additional million at october   based on achieving certain sales and earnings targets 
the sellers are entitled to future payments ranging from zero to million if certain sales and earnings targets are achieved during the two years ending october  the amount of goodwill initially recorded for the transaction would increase if such contingent payments are made 
goodwill arises from synergies we believe can be achieved integrating dc s product lines and operations with our other businesses  and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 
during fiscal  we paid million to the previous shareholders of the asia pacific division and accrued million based on the achievement of certain sales and earnings targets of the asia pacific division through october  this is the last deferred purchase price payment related to our acquisition of our licensees in australia and japan and is expected to be paid in fiscal also during fiscal  we paid the remaining deferred purchase price obligation related to our acquisition of the

table of contents joint venture arrangements in  we formed a joint venture with glorious sun enterprises  ltd 
to pursue opportunities to develop our quiksilver business in china 
the joint venture is owned by us and owned by glorious sun 
neither partner can independently control the joint venture  and accordingly  the results of its operations are not consolidated in our financial statements 
rather  our pro rata share of the operating profits or losses are reported in our income statements as a component of operating income  and our net investment is included in other assets 
our investment in the joint venture has not been material to date  but additional capital contributions are anticipated as the joint venture ramps up its business and annual business plans are approved by us and glorious sun 
as of october   we have boardriders club stores  in mainland china and in hong kong 
we also have an additional shops  located within larger department stores 
in november  we formed a joint venture in brazil to further develop our quiksilver business in brazil with two other partners 
no partner can independently control the joint venture  and accordingly  the results of its operations are not consolidated in our financial statements 
rather  our pro rata share of the operating profit or loss is reported in our income statement as a component of operating income  and our net investment is included in other assets 
our investment in the joint venture has not been material to date 
we have a buyout agreement with the other partners that can be exercised at our option when the joint venture s revenues exceed certain levels 
if and when we exercise our buyout option  we will account for the purchase of the additional ownership in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
as of october  no portion of the buyout provision has been met and is not expected to be met in fiscal critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 

table of contents inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks licenses and other amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments  if any  would be recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is computed based on estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change  and we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in asia pacific  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and some european and asia pacific product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we also have other foreign currency obligations related to our acquisition of quiksilver international and asia pacific 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
table of contents foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income 
we also use other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting to mitigate our exposure to currency risks 
these derivatives are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
forward looking statements various statements in this form k  or incorporated by reference into this form k  in future filings by us with the sec  in our press releases and in oral statements made by or with the approval of authorized personnel  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are based on current expectations and are indicated by words or phrases such as anticipate  estimate  expect  seek  plan  may  project  we believe  currently envisions and similar words or phrases and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could affect our financial performance or cause actual results to differ from our estimates in  or underlying  such forward looking statements are set forth under item a 
risk factors 
forward looking statements include statements regarding  among other items our ability to fully realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisition of rossignol  the impact of our substantial leverage on our ability to generate cash flows or obtain financing to fund our anticipated growth strategies and the cost of such financing  our plans to expand internationally  our intention to introduce new products and enter into new joint ventures  our plans to open new retail stores  payments due on contractual commitments  future expenditures for capital projects  our ability to continue to maintain our brand image and reputation  our ability to remain compliant with our debt covenants  integration of acquired businesses and future acquisitions  general economic and business conditions  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in political  social and economic conditions and local regulations  particularly in europe and asia 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements as a result of the risks described in item a 
risk factors  and other factors including  among others  changes in the competitive marketplace  including the introduction of new products or pricing changes by our competitors  changes in the economy  and other events leading to a reduction in discretionary consumer spending 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot assure you that the forward looking information contained in this form k will  in fact  transpire 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note of our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income  and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
a gain of million was recognized related to these types of contracts during fiscal for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur through september assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  million of gains  net of tax  related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next sixteen months 
on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate certain of the derivatives as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and distort comparisons from year to year 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but accounting rules do not allow us to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for quiksilver europe 
it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of 
table of contents profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect 
in fiscal  the us dollar weakened compared to the euro and the australian dollar 
as a result  our european revenues increased in euros compared to an increase of in us dollars 
asia pacific revenues increased in australian dollars compared to an increase of in us dollars 
interest rates most of our lines of credit and long term debt bear interest based on libor and euribor 
interest rates  therefore  can move up or down depending on market conditions 
as discussed above  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations 
the approximate amount of our remaining variable rate debt was million at october   and the average interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates were to increase by  our net income would be reduced by approximately million based on these fiscal levels
