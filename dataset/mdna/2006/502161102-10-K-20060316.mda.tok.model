corrigan s status as an employee of lsi ceased 
since joining lsi  mr 
talwalkar has been in the process of assessing the strategic foundation and operational effectiveness of our overall business 
in the third quarter of  we announced a broad based reorganization as well as the decision to move to a fabless semiconductor model 
our rsa business  formerly part of the semiconductor segment  is now included in the storage systems segment 
the combination of rsa and engenio  our wholly owned subsidiary  will allow us to more efficiently deliver a broad portfolio of software  storage products and platforms to meet original equipment manufacturer oem customer needs 
on september   we announced that we intend to sell our gresham  oregon manufacturing facility as part of our strategy to move to a fabless semiconductor manufacturing model 
our new strategy includes the expansion of our working relationships with major foundry partners and the adoption of a roadmap leading to the production of advanced semiconductors utilizing nanometer and below process technology on mm or inch wafers 
we recorded million in charges directly associated with the decision to sell the gresham manufacturing facility 
the details of these charges are included in the discussion on restructuring included under the results of operations section of this md a and also in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues for the year ended december  were  million representing a increase as compared to  million in revenues for the year ended december  the increase in revenues represents increases in both our semiconductor and storage systems segments 
we reported a net loss of million or a diluted share for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million or a diluted share for the year ended december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of december  as compared to million at december  for the year ended december   we generated million in cash provided by operations as compared to million for the year ended december  separation and stock option exchange program of our storage systems business 
on february   engenio filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for the initial public offering of its common stock 
on july   lsi announced jointly with engenio the postponement of the initial public offering of its common stock due to then current market conditions 
we have since decided not to move forward with an initial public offering 
on september   we exchanged options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of engenio common stock for options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of lsi s common stock 
the exchange occurred in accordance with the terms of the engenio equity incentive plan  which provided for the automatic exchange of the options in the event it was determined that the engenio initial public offering was not likely to occur 
the original exercise prices of the options were multiplied by an exchange ratio equal to the relative fair values of engenio and lsi stock on the exchange date 
significant acquisitions and other major transactions 
we continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions that build upon our existing library of intellectual property  human capital  including engineering talent  and seek to increase our leadership position in the markets in which we operate 
all of our recent acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and accordingly  the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements as of the effective date of each acquisition 
the transactions are summarized below 
there were no significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the companies acquired

the information provided herein for the semiconductor and storage systems segments have been recast to reflect the realignment of the rsa group to the storage systems segment from the semiconductor segment for all periods presented 
results of operations on march   we announced plans to focus our business on growth opportunities in the storage and consumer markets 
revenues year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment storage systems segment consolidated there were no significant inter segment revenues during the periods presented 
compared to total consolidated revenues for increased million or as compared to  reflecting revenue increases in both segments 
semiconductor segment revenues for the semiconductor segment increased million or in as compared to the increase in revenues in the semiconductor segment is primarily attributable to the following factors an increase in revenues for semiconductors used in consumer product applications as a result of increased demand for digital audio players  dvd recorders and cable set top box solutions  offset in part by decreases in demand for semiconductors used in video game products  and an increase in revenues for semiconductors used in storage product applications primarily attributable to higher demand for custom silicon used in hard disk drives 
the above noted increases in revenues were offset in part by decreased revenues for semiconductors used in communications product applications such as office automation  switch and wireless products 

table of contents storage systems segment revenues for the storage systems segment increased million or in from the increase in revenues in the storage systems segment is primarily attributable to increased demand from one large customer for our new high performance controller product introduced in the second quarter of and also for our command module products 
we expect total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of to be within a range of million to million 
compared to total consolidated revenues for increased million or less than one percent as compared to semiconductor segment revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease in revenues for the semiconductor segment is primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling prices and demand for semiconductors used in video game products  and a decrease in demand for semiconductors used in office automation products and enterprise switch products 
these decreases were offset in part by the following increases in demand for semiconductors used in storage product applications such as our ultra scsi and custom silicon used in hard disk drives and host adapter boards 
the ultra product line was introduced in the latter part of  an increase in demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications such as dvd recorders 
we introduced our dvd recorder semiconductor product in the latter part of and early  and an increase in demand for semiconductors used in communication product applications such as wireless solutions 
storage systems segment revenues for the storage systems segment increased million or in from the increase in revenues for the storage systems segment was primarily attributable to increased demand for our entry level controller products that were introduced in late april and increased demand for our other controller and disk enclosure related products 
in addition to our introduction of the new entry level controller product  we believe that the increased demand from our largest customers was driven by the trend toward purchasing modular storage systems  our increased focus on sales of our products to our channel customers  the economic rebound that began in the middle of  increased spending on information technology by organizations and increased outsourcing by oems 

table of contents significant customers 
the following table summarizes the number of our significant customers  each of whom accounted for or more of our revenues  along with the percentage of revenues they individually represent on a consolidated basis and by segment year ended december  semiconductor segment number of significant customers percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment number of significant customers percentage of segment revenues consolidated number of significant customers percentage of consolidated revenues revenues by geography 
the following table summarizes our revenues by geography year ended december  in millions revenues north america asia  including japan europe total revenues by geography are accumulated based on the revenues generated by our subsidiaries located within the three geographic areas noted in the above table 
in the second half of  engenio formed new subsidiaries within europe 
as a result  the amounts in the table reflect that change as of june  and prior to that all revenues generated by engenio europe were previously reported in north america 
compared to in  revenues increased in north america  asia  including japan and europe as compared to the increase in revenues in north america for is primarily attributable to an increase in demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications such as digital audio players and set top box solutions and increases in revenues in the storage systems segment 
the increase was offset in part by decreased demand for semiconductors used in storage product applications such as custom silicon for the server market and communication product applications 
the increase in asia  including japan  is attributable to higher demand for semiconductors used in storage product applications such as hard disk drives 
these increases were offset in part by lower demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications such as video games and communications product applications such as enterprise switches 
the increase in europe is attributable to increased demand for products in the semiconductor segment such as ultra  tape drives and dvd recorders and also increases in demand for products in the storage system segment 
compared to in  revenues decreased in north america and asia  including japan  while revenues increased in europe as compared to the decrease in revenues in north america is primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for modular storage products associated with engenio as a result of the allocation of revenues to the newly formed subsidiaries in europe  as discussed above  and a decrease in demand for semiconductors used in storage and consumer product applications  such as cable and set top box solutions 

table of contents the decrease in north america was offset in part by an increase in demand for semiconductors used in communication product applications such as routers  switches and wireless solutions 
the decrease in revenues in asia  including japan  is primarily due to lower demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications  such as video game products  and semiconductors used in communication product applications  such as office automation products and switches 
the decrease in asia  including japan  was offset in part by an increase in demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications  such as dvd recorders  and semiconductors used in storage product applications  such as hard disk drives and our ultra product line 
the increase in europe is a result of the allocation of revenues to the newly formed subsidiaries in europe for engenio as previously discussed  offset in part by decreased demand across all semiconductor product applications 
operating costs and expenses 
key elements of the consolidated statements of operations for the respective segments are as follows gross profit margin year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues compared to the consolidated gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues was in and the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the semiconductor segment was in and in  gross profit margins included more favorable manufacturing variances for the gresham manufacturing facility associated with yield improvements and operating cost savings attributable to write downs recorded in the second half of related to the impairment of the gresham manufacturing facility see note of the notes 
this favorable effect on gross profit margin was offset by an unfavorable shift in the overall mix 
the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the storage systems segment decreased to in from in mainly due to changes in product mix reflecting lower sales volumes for some of our higher end storage products  and lower selling prices for rsa products and some of our older products 
these declines were only partially offset by margin improvements since the introduction of our new high end controller product introduced in the second quarter of we expect gross profit margins to be in the to range in the first quarter of compared to the consolidated gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues for the semiconductor segment  increased to in from in the following factors contributed to the improvement in the semiconductor segment s gross profit margins in as compared to the prior year a favorable shift in the overall mix of products sold to products with higher margins  including the introduction of new products such as semiconductors used in consumer product applications such as 
table of contents dvd recorders and semiconductors used in storage product applications such as our ultra product line and custom silicon used in hard disk drives  offset in part by lower average selling prices for semiconductors used in video game products for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of  lower manufacturing variances for the gresham manufacturing facility associated with yield improvements and better factory utilization  a reduction in cost of revenues as a result of the sale of our japan manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of  lower period costs in as compared to  as a result of the implementation of our nanometer manufacturing process technology during  and a reduction in compensation related costs and equipment related depreciation and rent expense primarily as a result of the restructuring actions and lease refinancing initiatives during the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the storage systems segment remained unchanged at in and research and development year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues compared to research and development r d expenses  on a consolidated basis  decreased million or during as compared to semiconductor segment r d expenses for the semiconductor segment consist primarily of employee salaries and materials used in the design of custom silicon and standard products  as well as depreciation of capital equipment and facilities 
on march   we announced that we will focus our r d activities in the storage and consumer markets and redirect r d spending from non core areas 
r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease in r d expenses for the semiconductor segment is primarily the result of the cost cutting measures implemented as part of the restructuring actions taken during see note of the notes  including lower compensation related expenses as well as lower equipment and depreciation expenses 
in addition  we spent less on design engineering programs during as compared to storage systems segment r d expenses for the storage systems segment consist primarily of employee salaries and materials used in product development  as well as depreciation of capital equipment and facilities 
in addition to the significant resources required to support hardware technology transitions  we devote significant resources to developing and enhancing software features and functionality to remain competitive 

table of contents r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased by million or in as compared to the increase is primarily due to increased compensation related expenditures that are based upon an increase in employees and increased spending for future r d projects 
compared to r d expenses  on a consolidated basis  decreased million or during as compared to semiconductor segment r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease is primarily a result of benefits from the cost cutting measures implemented as part of the restructuring actions taken in and see note of the notes including lower compensation related costs and benefits from the consolidation of our non manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we had lower equipment related costs as a result of entering into two equipment operating leases to replace two existing operating leases for the same equipment in the third quarter of  the buyout and write down of the purchased equipment from the new operating leases in the fourth quarter of  and certain assets becoming fully depreciated during storage systems segment r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased by million or in as compared to this is primarily a result of increased compensation costs due to higher headcount  higher expenses for outside service providers related to development programs and higher depreciation expense related to assets purchased for product development

sg a expenses for the storage systems segment increased million or in as compared to on july   we announced jointly with engenio the postponement of the initial public offering of its common stock due to then current market conditions 
the increase in sg a expenses in the storage systems segment is primarily due to higher compensation related costs due to an increase in employees and higher legal  accounting and other professional fees related to the initial public offering 
restructuring of operations and other items  net we recorded charges of million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december   consisting of million in charges for restructuring of operations and impairment of long lived assets and a charge of million for other items 
of these charges  million were recorded in the semiconductor segment and million were recorded as part of the storage systems segment 
the majority of our restructuring charges relate to asset impairment charges primarily associated with our decision to sell our gresham  oregon manufacturing facility as part of our strategy to move to a fabless semiconductor manufacturing model 
this strategy was announced on september  and it is our intention to sell the gresham facility within one year from the date of this announcement 
the gresham specific asset impairment charges were million 
the remainder of the restructuring charges relate to other asset write downs  severance and other termination benefits  lease exit costs  expenses to reflect the change in time value of accruals for facility lease termination costs  net of adjustments for changes in sublease assumptions 
a complete discussion of our restructuring actions is included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we realized savings mainly on depreciation of approximately million and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively as a result of our decision to sell the gresham facility 
we expect future savings associated with depreciation to be fully offset by decreased future loading for the gresham facility 
we also recorded a million charge related to other items mainly related to the following 
on may   wilfred j 
corrigan s status as an employee ceased and in connection with this event  we recorded a charge of million 
the amount was paid to mr 
corrigan in the second quarter of and was made in accordance with mr 
corrigan s employment agreement dated september  mr 
corrigan is our former chief executive officer 
these charges were recorded in the semiconductor segment

amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation of million  million and million was recorded in  and  respectively 
the acquisitions for which deferred stock compensation and related amortization were recorded consisted primarily of the accerant transaction in the second quarter of  the velio transaction in the first quarter of  an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  the acquisition of c cube and the raid business from ami in and the acquisition of datapath in we have also recorded non cash deferred stock compensation for restricted common shares issued to our employees  engenio employees and the non employee directors of engenio 
we amortize deferred stock compensation ratably over the related vesting periods 
deferred stock compensation is adjusted to reflect forfeitures prior to vesting 
at december   the deferred stock compensation that remained was million  and is expected to be amortized over the next four years 
on september   we exchanged options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of engenio common stock for options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of lsi s common stock 
the exchange occurred in accordance with the terms of the engenio equity incentive plan  which provided for the automatic exchange of the options in the event it was determined that the engenio initial public offering was not likely to occur 
the original exercise prices of the options were multiplied by an exchange ratio equal to the relative fair values of engenio and lsi stock on the exchange date 
the exchange program resulted in approximately million of deferred stock compensation  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the new awards of approximately to years 
amortization expense in was approximately million 
in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the company s ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement  instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes  the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments 
sfas r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
we have adopted sfas r as of january  sfas r applies to all unvested awards and awards granted after january  and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
we have elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption plus the current period expense for unvested awards issued prior to the adoption of this standard 
no expense is recognized for awards vested in prior periods 
although we have not determined the exact amount at this time  we expect that the adoption of this statement will result in amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation of approximately million for the three months ended march  beginning in  we have changed the method of valuation for share based awards granted from the black 
table of contents scholes option pricing model  which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas  to a binomial option pricing model see note and of the notes 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased to million in from million in amortization decreased as a result of the write down during the fourth quarter of and certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during  offset in part by amortization of intangible assets acquired during the first and second quarters of as of december   we had million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  that will continue to amortize 
amortization of intangibles decreased to million in from million in the decrease is due in part to the write down of intangible assets during in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge in restructuring and other items to write down million of intangible assets originally acquired in connection with the acquisition of datapath  which was added to our semiconductor segment during certain intangible assets became fully amortized during these decreases were offset in part by amortization of intangible assets acquired in the first and second quarters of as of december   we had million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization that will continue to amortize 
interest expense with the objective of protecting our cash flows and earnings from the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  while minimizing the cost of capital  we may enter into interest rate swaps 
in june  we entered into interest rate swaps the swaps with various investment banks 
the swaps effectively converted fixed interest payments on a portion of our convertible subordinated notes convertible notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
see note of the notes 
during the second quarter of  we terminated the swaps  resulting in a deferred gain of million that is being amortized as a benefit to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged convertible notes 
a portion of the deferred gain was written off as part of the net gain or loss on the repurchase redemption of the hedged convertible notes during  and as of december   a deferred gain of million was recorded as a component of the convertible notes 
interest expense remained flat at million in as compared to interest expense declined as a result of lower average debt balance from the repurchase of million of the convertible notes during the second quarter of  but was fully offset by a lower benefit from the amortization of the deferred gain on the terminated swaps 
interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease is due to the repurchase redemption of million of convertible notes during  an additional repurchase of million in the third quarter of and changes in the benefit received from the swaps prior to termination and the benefit from the amortization of the deferred gain after termination of the swaps  offset by the issuance of million of convertible notes during the second quarter of see note of the notes 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  was million in as compared to million in interest income increased by million to million in from million in the increase in interest income is mainly due to higher returns on our investments during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of other income  net of million in included the following a pre tax gain of million on sale of certain marketable available for sale equity securities see note of the notes  
table of contents a pre tax gain of million associated with marketable available for sale equity securities of a certain technology company that was acquired by another technology company see note of the notes  a pre tax gain of million on the repurchase of the convertible notes see note of the notes  a pre tax loss of million on impairment of certain non marketable available for sale equity securities 
management considered the impairment to be other than temporary see note of the notes  and a million expense for points on foreign currency forward contracts  which was offset in part by other miscellaneous items 
interest income and other  net  was million in as compared to million in interest income decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease in interest income is mainly due to lower returns on our short term investments during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of other income  net of million in included the following a pre tax gain of million associated with our investment in marketable available for sale equity securities of a certain technology company that was acquired by another publicly traded technology company  a pre tax gain of million on sales of certain marketable available for sale equity securities  a pre tax gain of million on repurchase of convertible notes see note of the notes  and a pre tax loss of million on impairment of our investment in certain marketable and non marketable available for sale equity securities and other miscellaneous items 
management considered the impairments to be other than temporary see note of the notes 
other expenses net of million in included million in charges associated with write downs of investments in marketable and non marketable available for sale equity securities due to impairments that were considered by management to be other than temporary see note of the notes  a net loss on the redemption repurchase of convertible notes of million  and currency option premium expenses  which were offset in part by net foreign exchange gains  gains on sale of miscellaneous assets and other expenses that were individually insignificant 
for all investment in debt and equity securities  unrealized losses are evaluated to determine if they are other than temporary 
we frequently monitor the credit quality of our investments in marketable debt securities 
in order to determine if impairment has occurred for equity securities  we review the financial performance of each investee  industry performance and outlook for each investee  the trading prices of marketable equity securities and pricing in current rounds of financing for non marketable equity securities 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary  a loss is recognized as a component of interest income and other 
for marketable equity securities  the impairment losses were measured using the closing market price of the marketable securities on the date management determined that the investments were impaired 
for non marketable equity securities  the impairment losses were measured by using pricing in current rounds of financing 
provision for income taxes during  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries taxed in the us  which have been partially offset by the benefit of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets not previously recognized and lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents in  the provision for income taxes was increased by a million charge related to the correction of an error in a prior period associated with the carrying value of million in deferred tax liabilities that should have been reclassified to goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets in the deferred tax liabilities were instead used as a reduction of our required valuation allowance in this was offset by tax related liabilities of million originally recorded in connection with these deferred tax balances which are no longer required 
we believe that this amount is not material to previously reported financial statements and have concluded that correcting such amounts in the fourth quarter of and the fiscal year  as opposed to restating prior periods  is appropriate in the circumstances 
also in  we recorded an income tax benefit for a state income tax refund due to an amended return related to one of our acquisitions as well as the release of previously reserved foreign withholding taxes based upon a favorable ruling received by a european country 
the income tax benefit was partially offset by additional income tax provision associated with the conclusion of an audit by the internal revenue service for the year ended december  we operate in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
our income tax expense is primarily related to taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions 
during  we recorded an income tax provision of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to increases in net deferred tax assets not currently benefited in the us  losses of certain foreign subsidiaries that are benefited at lower rates and earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries taxed in the us the company operates in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company s income tax expense was primarily related to taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions  which were not reduced by separate losses in other foreign jurisdictions 
during  we recorded an income tax provision of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries taxed in the us  and alternative minimum taxes 
the effect of these charges has been partially offset by the benefit of foreign tax and research and development tax credits 
see note of the notes 
minority interest in net income of subsidiary minority interest in net income of subsidiary was not significant for the periods presented 
the changes in minority interest were attributable to the composition of earnings and losses in our majority owned japanese subsidiary for each of the respective years 
financial condition  capital resources and liquidity cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase is mainly due to cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities  partially offset by net cash outflows for investing and financing activities as described below 
working capital 
working capital decreased by million to million at december   from million as of december  working capital declined in as a result of the following activities current portion of long term debt increased by million primarily due to the reclassification of the convertible subordinated notes that are due in november from long term debt to current portion of long term debt 
accounts payable increased by million due to the timing of payments 
inventories decreased by million to million as of december   from million as of december  the decline in inventory levels reflects our continued focus on supply chain management 

table of contents accrued salaries  wages and benefits increased by million primarily due to timing differences in payment of salaries  benefits and performance based compensation 
income taxes payable increased by million due to the timing of income tax payments made and the income tax provision recorded during current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities decreased by million due to net changes in underlying temporary differences see note of the notes 
the decrease in working capital was offset  in part  by the following cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by million 
assets held for sale increased by million during  primarily as a result of the reclassification of the gresham  oregon manufacturing facility and excess land from property and equipment to other current assets 
we announced our intention to sell the gresham  oregon manufacturing facility on september  see note of the notes 
in addition  prepaid insurance  debt issuance costs  prepaid software maintenance and other miscellaneous items also increased 
accounts receivable increased by million to million as of december  from million at december  the increase is mainly attributable to higher revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of other accrued liabilities decreased by million due to decreases in sales and other tax liabilities and deferred revenues  offset in part by increases in other miscellaneous items 
cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities 
during  we generated million of net cash and cash equivalents from operating activities compared to million generated in cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities for the year ended december  were the results of the following net loss adjusted for non cash transactions 
the non cash items and other non operating adjustments are quantified in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in this annual report on form k  and a net increase in assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  including changes in working capital components from december  to december   as discussed above 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during were million as compared to million used in the primary investing activities or changes during were as follows purchases of debt and equity securities available for sale  net of sales and maturities  purchases of property  equipment and software  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  and the receipt of an income tax refund for pre acquisition tax matters associated with an acquisition in we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in in recent years we have reduced our level of capital expenditures as a result of our focus on establishing strategic supplier alliances with foundry semiconductor manufacturers  which enables us to have access to advanced manufacturing capacity and reduces our capital spending requirements 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities during were million as compared to million in the primary financing activities during were as follows the repurchase of a portion of the convertible notes due in  the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and purchase plans  and the repayment of debt obligations 
it is our policy to reinvest our earnings and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and funds generated from operations  combined with funds from such financing and our ability to borrow funds  will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms 
moreover  any future equity or convertible debt financing will decrease the percentage of equity ownership of existing stockholders and may result in dilution  depending on the price at which the equity is sold or the debt is converted 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations year years years years total in millions convertible subordinated notes operating lease obligations purchase commitments total convertible subordinated notes as of december   we have million of convertible notes due in november convertible notes and million of the convertible notes due in may convertible notes 
all of the convertible notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and are convertible at the holder s option  at any time prior to the maturity date of the convertible notes  into shares of our common stock 
the and convertible notes have conversion prices of approximately per share and per share  respectively 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on at least days notice at any time on or after the call date  which is two years before the due date 
we cannot elect to redeem the convertible notes prior to maturity 
each holder of the and convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of any fundamental change  which includes a transaction or event such as an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger or combination 
interest is payable semiannually 
fluctuations in our stock price affect the prices of our outstanding convertible securities and the likelihood of the convertible securities being converted into cash or equity 
if we are required to redeem any of the convertible notes for cash  it may adversely affect our liquidity position 
in the event that the convertible notes are not converted to equity  we believe that our current cash position and expected future operating cash flows will be adequate to meet these obligations as they mature 
from time to time  we may repurchase or redeem convertible notes as we did in 
table of contents operating lease obligations we lease real estate  certain non manufacturing equipment and software under non cancelable operating leases 
purchase commitments we maintain certain purchase commitments  primarily for raw materials with suppliers and for some non production items 
purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties 
this forecasted time horizon can vary among different suppliers 
standby letters of credit at december  and  we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and million  respectively 
these instruments are off balance sheet commitments to extend financial guarantees for leases and certain self insured risks  import export taxes and performance under contracts  and generally have one year terms 
the fair value of the letters of credit approximates the contract amount 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes describes the significant accounting policies essential to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
we believe the following to be critical accounting estimates 
they are both important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results  and they require significant management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty  there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventory valuation methodology 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory impairment charges create a new cost basis for inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  product life cycles  life time buys at the end of supplier product runs and a shift of production to outsourcing 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than we project or our customers fail to meet projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was approximately million and million as of december   and  respectively 
if market conditions are more favorable than expected  we could experience more favorable gross profit margins going forward as we sell inventory that was previously written down 
see discussion in gross profit margin section earlier in this md a 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we currently operate our own wafer fabrication facility 
on september   we announced that we intend to sell our gresham  oregon manufacturing facility as part of our strategy to move to a fabless semiconductor manufacturing model 
we have historically pursued the acquisition of businesses  which has resulted in significant goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
table of contents recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset  or iv a significant decline in our market capitalization  for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
when we determine that there is an indicator that the carrying value of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles or related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure impairment based on estimates of future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses within our company  the fair values of certain assets based on thoroughly researched management estimates  and industry trends 
see notes and to the notes for more details on long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
as of december   we have a goodwill balance of million 
we monitor the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment  if any  would be determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which uses a fair value model for determining the carrying value of goodwill 
the impairment testing is a two step process and is performed by reporting unit 
our reporting units are semiconductor and storage systems 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value 
we concluded that goodwill was not impaired under the first step as of december  the second step is only performed if impairment is indicated after the first step is performed  as it involves measuring the actual impairment to goodwill 
our next annual test for the impairment of goodwill will be performed in our fourth fiscal quarter in we use management estimates of future cash flows to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins and operating expenses within lsi 
two methodologies were used to obtain the fair value for each reporting unit as of december  discounted cash flow and market multiple 
the discounted cash flow and market multiple methodologies include assumptions about future conditions within our reporting units and related industries 
these assumptions include estimates of future market size and growth  expected trends in technology  timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us  and the nature of the industry in which comparable companies and we operate 
if significant changes to these assumptions occur  goodwill could become impaired in the future 
restructuring reserves 
we have recorded reserves accruals for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring reserves include payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases and other contracts  decommissioning and selling costs associated with assets held for sale  and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
reserves are recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred 
the restructuring reserves are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
for example  existing accruals for severance may be modified if employees are redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated  accruals for outplacement services may not be fully utilized by former employees  and severance accruals could change for statutory reasons in countries outside the united states 
accruals for facility leases under which we ceased using the benefits conveyed to us under the lease may change if market conditions for subleases change or if we later negotiate a termination of the lease 
see discussion in restructuring of operations and other items  net earlier in this md a for changes in estimates made during  and income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
see note of the notes for more details about our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax rules and regulations within multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
our tax liabilities include estimates for all income and related taxes that we believe are probable and that can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent that our estimates are understated  additional charges to income tax expense would be recorded in the period in which we determine such understatement 
if our income tax estimates are overstated  income tax benefits will be recognized when realized

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity in  an interest rate move of basis points of our weighted average worldwide interest rate on outstanding debt in affecting our fixed and floating rate financial instruments as of december   including investments and debt obligations  would not have had a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year  assuming that the debt and investment balances remained consistent 
in  an interest rate move of basis points of our weighted average worldwide interest rate on outstanding debt in affecting our fixed and floating rate financial instruments as of december   including investments and debt obligations  would not have had a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year  assuming that the debt and investment balances remained consistent 
with the objective of protecting our cash flows and earnings from the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  while minimizing the cost of capital  we may enter into interest rate swaps 
as of december   there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 
in june  we entered into interest rate swap transactions the swaps with several investment banks 
the swaps effectively converted fixed interest payments on a portion of our and convertible notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting as fair value hedges  with changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the convertible notes being offset by changes in the fair values of the swaps recorded as a component of interest expense 
see note of the notes 
in the second quarter of  we terminated swaps with a notional amount of million 
the termination resulted in a deferred gain of million being recorded as a component of the convertible notes and to be amortized as a benefit to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged convertible notes 
a portion of the deferred gain was written off as part of the net gain or loss on the repurchase redemption of the hedged convertible notes during and as of december   a deferred gain of million remains to be amortized 
in  before termination  the difference between the changes in the fair values of the derivative and the hedged risk resulted in a benefit to interest expense of million 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the libor based floating rate interest payments on the equipment operating lease  with an original notional amount of million  to a fixed interest rate lease swap 
an expense of approximately million was recorded to cost of revenues in as the lease payments were made 
in august  the company entered into two new equipment operating leases for the wafer fabrication equipment that was previously on the above mentioned leases 
as a result of entering into the new leases  the hedged forecasted interest payments were no longer probable 
hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the balance in accumulated comprehensive income was immediately recorded as a gain of million in restructuring and other items in the statement of operations 
in september  the company terminated the lease swap 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we have foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to limit these exposures through operational strategies and financial market 
table of contents instruments 
we use various hedge instruments  primarily forward contracts with maturities of twelve months or less and currency option contracts  to manage our exposure associated with net asset and liability positions and cash flows denominated in non functional currencies 
we did not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during and based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   including derivative financial instruments and non functional currency denominated receivables and payables  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
in  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would also not have had a significant effect 
equity price risk 
we have investments in available for sale equity securities included in long term assets 
the fair values of these investments are sensitive to equity price changes 
changes in the value of these investments are ordinarily recorded through accumulated comprehensive income 
the increase or decrease in the fair value of the investments would affect our results of operations to the extent the investments were sold or that declines in value were concluded by management to be other than temporary 
if prices of the available for sale equity securities increase or decrease from their fair value as of december   it would increase or decrease the investment values by million 
as of december   a increase or decrease in fair value would have increased or decreased the investment values by million 
we do not use any derivatives to hedge the fair value of our marketable available for sale equity securities
