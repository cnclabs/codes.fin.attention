item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business northrop grumman provides technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and solutions in information and services  aerospace  electronics  and shipbuilding 
as a prime contractor  principal subcontractor  partner  or preferred supplier  northrop grumman participates in many high priority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states and abroad 
northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the united states us government  principally the department of defense dod 
the company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales 
outlook us defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years 
while the current us defense budget forecast shows a slower rate of growth than in prior years  and certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions  the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and solutions in systems integration  defense electronics  information technology  advanced aircraft  shipbuilding  and space technology will generate revenue growth in and beyond 
in  based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately billion as of december   and its opportunity to win future programs  the company expects sales of approximately billion and continued improvements in net income over expected sales reflect the impact of the company s strategic decision to exit the value added reseller business reported under information technology as the enterprise information technology business area as well as several small businesses 
the major industry and economic factors that will affect the company s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 
industry factors while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace  it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix 
northrop grumman  along with lockheed martin corporation  the boeing company  raytheon company  and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time 
northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs  both large and small 
intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman s business and the defense industry 
it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies 
a company competing to be a prime contractor may  upon ultimate award of the contract to another party  turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party 
it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and  simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts 
the nature of major defense programs  conducted under binding contracts  allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 
the company s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services  as well as its ability to provide the people  technologies  facilities  equipment  and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 
it is necessary to maintain  as the company has  sources for raw materials  fabricated parts  electronic components  and major subassemblies 
in this manufacturing and systems integration environment  effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 
economic opportunities  challenges  and risks the defense of the united states and other north atlantic treaty organization nato countries requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts  terrorist acts  or threats to homeland security  and is 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation increasingly more dependent upon proactive threat identification 
such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement  deterrence  policing  or peacekeeping 
in addition  the dod s strategy continues to be affected by the general public s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk 
as a result of these trends  both the united states and other nato countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated systems that provide long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world 
accordingly  defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms 
while the upward trend in overall defense spending is beginning to slow  budgets are expected to continue to exhibit real growth in the coming years 
defense spending in nato countries  however  is flat or trending downward  those countries are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities 
although the quadrennial defense review eliminated a few major procurement programs in the fiscal budget  it did increase the dod focus on intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr  joint command and control  and other areas for future budget submissions 
the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain  but the budget submitted by the president of the united states indicates that the defense budget will increase approximately billion  or percent  over the amount enacted for fiscal while this budget includes proposed reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expected to compete  the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority  with particular emphasis on areas involving isr and irregular warfare capabilities 
us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates  or strives to participate  must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation s budget formulation and appropriation processes 
budget decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry 
substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include aerial refueling tanker  crew exploratory vehicle  long range bomber  space radar  transformational communication system  restricted programs and several international and homeland security programs 
the company continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in and beyond 
northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth  airborne surveillance  battle management  precision weapons  systems integration  defense electronics  and information technology 
the company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems  the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines  space technology  command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr and missile systems 
the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense  but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced  extended  or terminated 
the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non conforming items for a specified period of time 
most of the company s product warranties are provided under government contracts  the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer 
prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations  including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act  with noncompliance found by any one

contracts the majority of the company s business is generated from long term government contracts for development  production  and service activities 
government contracts typically include the following negotiated cost elements direct material  labor and subcontracting costs  and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs 
unless otherwise specified in a contract  costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulations far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of far and cas include  but are not limited to certain legal costs  mark to market stock compensation expense  lobbying costs  charitable donations  and advertising costs 
the company s long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories cost reimbursement or cost type contracts cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 
fixed price contracts a fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined  negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment because of costs incurred by the contractor 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation the following table summarizes revenue recognized by contract type and customer in millions us government other customers total percent of total cost type fixed price total contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both cost type and fixed price contracts may include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fee  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  percentage of completion of the contract  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
positive award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  and technical ingenuity 
award fees are determined and earned based on the subjective evaluation by the customer of the company s performance against such negotiated criteria 
award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company s operating segments  examples of significant long term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kinetic energy interceptors kei  national polar orbiting operational environmental satellite system npoess  f  lpd  and dd x programs 
compliance and monitoring on a regular basis  the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 
critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments the company s significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements see in part ii  item of this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as part of its oversight responsibilities  management evaluates the propriety of its estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies  judgments  and assessments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company s financial statements with a fair presentation of information  in all material respects  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 
principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below 
revenue recognition overview the company generally recognizes revenue from its long term contracts under the cost to cost and the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
for most contracts  sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for certain contracts with large up front purchases of material  primarily in the ships segment  sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period  and as the cost of product sales the costs allocable to the delivered units  costs allocated to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventoried costs 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of its products and services 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
sales under percentage of completion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred or units are delivered 
revenue relating to service contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
cost estimation the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  program managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the effect of change orders  the effect of any delays in performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of any claims or requests for equitable adjustment included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances 
cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
performance incentives and award fees many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred 
incentives and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded 
loss provisions when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded as cost of sales in the period the loss is determined 
loss provisions are first offset against contract costs that are included in inventories  with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 
other changes in estimates other changes in estimates of contract sales  costs  and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
hence  the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
see also the discussion on company s revenue recognition policy in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation purchase accounting and goodwill overview the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties or restructuring activities  the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 
acquisition accruals the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures 
these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures 
the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on management s experience and consultation with outside valuation specialists 
goodwill the company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually in november  or when evidence of potential impairment exists  in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles assets 
in order to test for potential impairment  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the weighted average cost of capital wacc and the terminal value growth rate assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value growth rates are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
the terminal value growth rate used for testing purposes in approximates the estimated long term inflation rate 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies overview in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
the company is subject to a range of claims  lawsuits  environmental and income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation its internal and external legal counsel 
while the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  resolution of one or more of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  could have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
environmental accruals the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations 
the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
factors which could result in changes to the company s environmental accruals and reasonably possible range of loss include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated  changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements  and improvements in remediation technology 
litigation accruals litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
tax contingency accruals the company records accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority 
changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from pre acquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill 
adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 
retirement benefits overview assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries 
in the event that the company determines that changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
assumptions the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company s financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rates 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical long term bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each benefit plan 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  the company s composite discount rate was unchanged at percent for december   and december   respectively 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations 
for  the company assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
for  the expected long term rate of return assumption is also percent 
differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on pension results in millions 
percentage point increase 
percentage point decrease decrease increase to pension expense resulting from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
for and  the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent 
differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on postretirement benefit results in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease increase decrease from change in health care cost trend rates postretirement benefit expense postretirement benefit liability management financial measures the company manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through the following measures contract acquisitions contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer 
contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and follow on orders 
in the year that a business is purchased  its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract acquisitions 
in the year that a business is sold  its existing funded order backlog as of the divestiture date is deducted from contract acquisitions 
sales year to year sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 
for further information see discussion concerning revenue recognition included in the critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments section of this part ii  item segment operating margin segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts and programs 
excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance  including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and retiree benefits  and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the federal acquisition regulation  and therefore not allocated to the segments

operating margin for included a million pre tax charge for f block and a million pre tax charge for wedgetail  as discussed in the following paragraph 
fixed price development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production and therefore more variability in estimates of costs to complete the work 
as work progresses through the development stage into production  the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced 
while management has used its best judgment to estimate costs  future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates 
electronic systems segment operating margin increased million  or percent  in as compared with operating margin in increased primarily due to increased sales volume and performance improvements in the postal automation business and bio detection systems in the government systems business area  as well as higher sales volume  improved performance  and contract close outs in the defensive navigation systems and defense other business areas
