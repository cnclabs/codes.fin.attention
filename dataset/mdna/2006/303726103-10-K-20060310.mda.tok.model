item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the company s past performance  its financial condition and its prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview results of operations in process research and development liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of fairchild international  excluding subsidiaries critical accounting policies and estimates forward looking statements policy on business outlook disclosure and quiet periods outlook recently issued financial accounting standards overview from our beginning as an independent semiconductor company in  we have grown both organically and through acquisitions to become the top supplier of power semiconductors in the world 
recently  we have undergone a shift in our strategy to focus on developing semiconductor products that provide solutions for power management in the consumer  computing  automotive  industrial and communications markets 
in addition  we continue to expand our presence in the asian regional markets  specifically in china  where we see high growth potential 
our strategy shift and focus on power products has allowed us to increase our power revenue from just of total sales in fiscal year to of total sales in fiscal year we have a wide portfolio of products that leverage expertise in both analog and discrete power technologies  as well as products that provide our customers with an integrated total power management solution in a single  multi chip module package 
at the beginning of  we reorganized our internal reporting and management structure and  accordingly  our segment reporting to reflect our strategic focus on power products 
the new segments  power discrete  power analog and standard products  align with the way we now manage the business and should help investors better judge our performance 
all segment reporting within management s discussion and analysis has been restated to reflect this change 
one of our primary goals for was to reduce both internal and distribution inventories by increasing our focus on channel sell through  or end market demand  while constraining our factory output and shipments 
while our distributor resales increased during  we slowed sales into the distribution channel and allowed the distributor inventory levels to adjust to lower levels 
this reduced distribution inventory of supply on hand from approximately weeks to approximately weeks at the end of the year 
during the second half of the year  we continued to refine product line inventory levels at the distributors and substantially completed this phase of channel inventory adjustments 
in addition  we reduced our internal inventory as well 
internal inventory decreased by million from our december  balances and inventory turns increased to times in from times in during  we also focused on improving the quality of our business by managing product mix more selectively and increasing the mix of our more proprietary  higher margin new products 
one element of this approach was to hold annual capital expenditures to to of sales  with at compared to in by limiting our capital spending for additional capacity  we are forced to aggressively manage product mix in order to free up capacity for higher margin  faster growing products 

table of contents gross margins  operating margins and inventory turns continue to be key indices that both senior management and our investors utilize to measure our financial performance 
in order to improve these margins  management implemented the above discussed inventory reduction initiative 
in addition  the estimated useful life change described below  contributed approximately million to the inventory reduction in another key performance indicator we use is days sales outstanding dso 
in  dso decreased to days compared to days in in addition to reducing our capital spending model to to of sales  we also completed an analysis of the useful life of our factory machinery and equipment and adjusted certain estimated useful life assumptions upward  from five to eight years  in the third quarter of  to better align our depreciation to our actual historical useful lives 
this led to a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million in the second half of  which was offset by cost of sales of inventory manufactured under previous costs of approximately million for a net favorable impact of approximately million during the second half of in addition  we identified certain software programs that we intended to abandon 
in the third and fourth quarter of  this resulted in approximately million of accelerated depreciation on these assets 
during  we booked a full valuation allowance for net us deferred tax assets after we determined that the us deferred tax assets are not likely to be recovered 
the valuation allowance resulted in an increase in the provision for income taxes and contributed significantly to the net loss on the consolidated statement of operations for see item  note for additional information 
we continue to follow our asset light investment strategy for many of our standard products  which typically have lower gross margins and lower or negative long term sales growth potential 
through this strategy we are gradually transferring the manufacturing for these mature products to third party subcontractors  where appropriate  thereby allowing our own manufacturing facilities to focus on building higher growth  higher margin and more strategic products 
we believe that by following this long term asset light approach for mature products  we will improve our return on invested capital and lessen our exposure to falling prices on commodity products during industry downturns 
while our expanding power product portfolio serves a wide variety of end markets  our sales tend to follow a seasonal pattern which is affected by consumer and corporate purchasing patterns  and regional lifestyle issues such as vacation periods and holidays 
typically  our strongest shipping quarter is the fourth quarter  which is driven by sales into products that are purchased by consumers for the christmas holiday season 
first quarter sales are generally weaker than the fourth quarter  as our production lines are constrained by the celebration of lunar new year holidays in asia 
second quarter sales are generally stronger than the first quarter  often driven by stronger corporate spending 
third quarter sales are generally weaker than the second quarter as customer summer vacation schedules slow business activity 
these are general seasonal trends that we have observed over many years  however  specific conditions in any given year  such as channel inventory builds or corrections  customer demand increases or decreases  new end market product cycles  or macroeconomic or political events may override these cyclical patterns 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results as derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  december  december  dollars in millions total revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquisition related intangibles restructuring and impairments reserve for potential settlement losses purchased in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense interest income other expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues for decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease came across all segments  particularly standard products  which accounted for almost half the decline or million for the year 
overall  decreases in average selling prices contributed of the decrease  while unit volumes accounted for the remaining of the decline 
in addition  our revenue declines were in line with our goal to reduce distributor inventory 
we anticipated this decline and as of the end of  feel that our inventory levels have stabilized and are in line with our internal and distributor goals outlined in the overview above 

table of contents as a percentage of sales  geographic sales for the united states  other americas  europe  china  taiwan  korea and other asia pacific which for these geographic reporting purposes includes japan and singapore and excludes korea were as follows for and year ended december  december  united states other americas europe china taiwan korea other asia pacific total the decrease in our united states percentage of sales is a result of customers moving purchases of product to the asia region 
the increase in our china percentage of sales is due to our growing customer base  as well as our commitment to investing our resources in this growing region 
the decrease in our korean percentage of sales is due to lower than expected sales  which we anticipate will begin to increase in future quarters 
gross profit 
consistent with our revenues  our gross profits were impacted by our continued efforts to reduce internal and channel inventory levels 
during  approximately of the gross profit decrease in dollar terms was due to the previously discussed decline in revenues  with the remaining decrease due to lower factory utilization  particularly in power analog as the product line adjusted inventory levels to support their high margin business model 
included in gross profit is a change in certain estimated useful life assumptions of machinery and equipment  as discussed above  which is an approximate net million benefit  recorded in cost of sales 
in addition  gross profit includes a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on assets to be abandoned  recorded in cost of sales 
included in gross profit are a million net sales reserves release and a million net inventory charge associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively 
operating expenses 
r d expenses were flat as a percentage of sales for as compared to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased as a percentage of sales for as compared to during  sg a includes a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on certain assets to be abandoned 
also included in sg a is a million non cash expense for the vesting of equity awards related to certain employee retirements recorded in the first quarter of lastly  we experienced an approximate million increase in legal costs associated with litigation defense 
the decrease in amortization of acquisition related intangibles is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of and second quarter of in addition  we reduced amortization relating to the million developed technology impairment loss recorded in the third quarter of see item  note for additional information 
restructuring and impairments 
in order to better align our cost structure with our revenues  we continually consider the rationalization of both our manufacturing operations and our workforce levels 
as a result  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges include million in employee separation costs  million in office closure costs  million in asset impairment costs associated with software  equipment and developed technology  as well as million in other charges all associated with our infrastructure realignment program 
in addition  we released million in reserves associated with the second quarter restructuring program  infrastructure realignment programs  and infrastructure realignment program 
we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges included million of costs associated with the closure of our six inch fab in mountaintop  pennsylvania  million 
table of contents of net costs associated with the closure of our four inch south portland  maine wafer fab  million in employee separation costs relating to our infrastructure realignment program  million of costs associated with the closure of our kuala lumpur  malaysia plant  and million of asset impairment charges related to the discontinuation of our memory product line 
in addition  we released million in reserves primarily associated with the restructuring program 
the charges associated with the mountaintop and south portland fabs  and the kuala lumpur plant were the remaining charges from our restructuring plan announced in july total net costs for the closure of the six inch wafer fab in mountaintop were approximately million for severance and million for all other related costs and impairments 
the closure was considered substantially complete as of december  based on comparisons to our fourth quarter spending levels  the closure allowed us to save approximately million annually in manufacturing costs  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of the approximately employees 
total net costs for the south portland four inch closure were approximately million in severance and million in asset impairments and other exit costs including decommissioning and technology transfer costs 
the closure was considered substantially complete as of december  the south portland four inch fab closure allowed us to save approximately million annually in manufacturing costs  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees 
total net costs for the wuxi and kuala lumpur closures were approximately million in severance and million in asset impairments and other exit costs including decommissioning and technology transfer costs 
both of these closures were considered substantially complete as of december  these closures allowed us to save approximately million annually in manufacturing costs beginning in  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately  employees 
the infrastructure realignment program actions announced in impacted both manufacturing and non manufacturing personnel  primarily in the united states  and are expected to be completed in the second quarter of as a result of the million charged  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees  we anticipate cost savings of approximately million in manufacturing and non manufacturing costs on an annualized basis beginning in the infrastructure realignment program actions announced in impacted both manufacturing and non manufacturing personnel  primarily in the united states  and are expected to be completed in the third quarter of as a result of the million charged  net of releases  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees  we anticipate cost savings of approximately million in manufacturing and non manufacturing costs on an annualized basis beginning in in addition  we expect annualized cost savings of million associated with depreciation savings related to asset impairment charges 
reserve for potential settlement losses 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million as an additional reserve for potential settlement losses based on our analysis of the claims and our historical experience in defending and or resolving these claims 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million as a reserve for potential settlement losses 
see item  note of this report for further information 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in  as compared to we had gross interest expense savings of million related to the paydown of our notes on february  these savings were offset by an increase in interest paid on our term loan resulting from the million increase in the term loan  which was used to paydown the notes  as well as rising interest rates on the variable rate loan during interest income 
the increase in interest income in is due to improved rates of return earned on cash and short term marketable securities as compared to other expense 
during  we recorded million of net other expense 
this includes million of net lawsuit settlement gains  a net million recovery of strategic investment write offs and million for costs associated with the redemption of our notes 
the million recovery includes a million charge associated with the write down of a strategic investment  offset by a million recovery of a third quarter 
table of contents strategic investment write off 
the million for costs associated with the redemption of our notes includes million for the call premium and other transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees 
in  we recorded a charge of million related to impairment losses associated with our strategic investments 
income taxes 
income taxes for were million  on loss before taxes of million  as compared to million  on income before taxes of million  for included in tax expense of million for is a non cash charge of million for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we recorded a tax liability of million during the fourth quarter of as we took advantage of the american jobs creation act ajca and repatriated foreign earnings and profits of million to the united states 
reportable segments 
comparative disclosures of revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments are as follows year ended december  december  gross gross revenue of total profit revenue of total profit dollars in millions power discrete power analog standard products total power discrete 
power discrete revenues decreased approximately in  as compared to a decline in average selling prices brought revenues down  while a decline in unit volume contributed the remainder of the overall decrease in the decline in average selling prices was the result of continued pricing pressure  particularly from competition in china and changes in our product mix 
the decline in unit volume was the result of reduced demand  in all regions except for china  as a result of our focus on reducing distributor inventory levels 
the slight increase in the china region was driven by increased sales in the consumer  motion control and offline power supply end markets  due to design wins and captured market share 
despite the declines in revenue  we experienced growth in areas where we have made significant r d investments  specifically for our powertrench iii and powertrench iv and spm tm products 
we expect continued growth in these areas during gross profits decreased due to unfavorable changes in product mix  due to higher content of low margin product  as well as our attempts to reduce internal and distributor inventory which  as a result  decreased our factory utilization 
included in power discrete gross profit is approximately million of net benefit relating to the depreciable life change 
in  gross profit also includes a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on assets to be abandoned  recorded in cost of sales 
in  gross profit includes a release of million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products 
power discrete had operating income of million in  as compared to million in the decrease in operating income was due to lower gross profits and higher sg a expenses 
r d expenses were roughly flat 
sg a expenses increased mainly due to increased allocated legal expenses  an increased focus on more field application support  as well as allocated non cash expenses related to certain employee retirement benefits 
also  included in sg a is a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on certain assets to be abandoned 
acquisition amortization decreased due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of and second quarter of in addition  acquisition amortization decreased due to impairment of developed technology recorded in the third quarter of power analog 
power analog revenues decreased approximately in  as compared to a decline in average selling prices and product mix decreased revenues  while a moderate increase in unit volume grew revenues during the decline in revenues was seen across virtually all products and regions  
table of contents mainly due to our initiative to reduce distributor inventory levels 
in addition  virtually all products experienced lower average selling prices due to pricing pressure in the market  as well as a shift in product mix 
despite these declines  we continue to see growth in our analog switches which grew year over year  or growth of roughly million 
overall  lower average selling prices  offset by modest unit increases were the major driver of lower gross margins year over year in dollar terms 
we also reduced inventory levels through portfolio management both internally and in the distribution channel to better align with our business model of focusing on faster turning  more proprietary products 
this has also driven lower factory utilization 
we have also recorded inventory write downs as we discontinue certain products  which allow us to continue to focus on higher value  higher margin offerings 
in addition  in the third quarter power analog recorded approximately million of inventory charges and sales returns related to a quality issue that has subsequently been resolved 
in  gross profit includes a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on assets to be abandoned  recorded in cost of sales 
gross profit in includes a charge release of million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
power analog had operating income loss of million in  as compared to million in r d expenses increased as a percentage of sales as a result of incremental spending for additional design resources and associated development costs 
this coupled with lower overall revenues caused r d as a percent of sales to increase 
we will continue to invest in r d to be able to fund future higher value  higher margin products 
sg a expenses increased due to non cash expenses related to certain employee retirement benefits as well as higher allocated legal expenses 
also  included in sg a is a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on certain assets to be abandoned 
acquisition amortization decreased due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of standard products 
standard products revenues decreased approximately in  as compared to unit volumes decreased sales  while declines in average selling prices contributed an additional to the overall decline during the decline in revenues was due to reduced demand due to our initiative to actively reduce distributor inventory levels  as well as significant pricing pressure 
the decline in units was driven mainly by reduced demand for our logic and discrete standard products 
virtually all end markets declined and on a regional basis  japan saw an over decrease in revenues as distributors substantially reduced their inventories of our products 
in addition  revenues declined million in  or of the total revenue decline compared to the same periods of  due to the discontinuation of the memory product line during in the future  we anticipate that standard products as a percentage of total revenue will continue to decrease  as our strategic focus shifts to the power analog and power discrete segments 
included in standard product gross profit is approximately million of net benefit relating to the depreciable life change 
standard product gross profit in also includes a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on assets to be abandoned  recorded in cost of sales 
standard product gross profits  excluding the effect of the discontinuation of the memory product line  which was approximately million in  decreased due to a combination of lower factory utilization and our initiative to more selectively choose the business in this area 
while we anticipate revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of our total revenues  our strategy is to manage standard products more selectively  while increasing our margins in this business 
we expect our future revenue mix for standard products to shift slightly away from optoelectronics due to the sale of the led and led display business that took place in the beginning of see item  note for additional information 
standard products gross profit in includes a charge release of million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our and restructuring actions 
standard products had operating income of million in  as compared to million in r d expenses were roughly flat as a percentage of revenue  while sg a expenses increased slightly due to a non cash expense related to certain employee retirement benefits and higher allocated legal expenses 
also  included in sg a is a charge of million for accelerated depreciation on certain assets to be abandoned 
acquisition amortization decreased due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of and the second quarter of 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues increased million in compared to this increase was driven primarily by continued growth in the power management market  new product introductions  and overall improved industry and economic conditions compared to  particularly in the first half of as a percentage of sales  geographic sales for the united states  other americas  europe  china  taiwan  korea and other asia pacific which for these geographic reporting purposes includes japan and singapore and excludes korea were as follows for and year ended december  december  united states other americas europe china taiwan korea other asia pacific total the increase in our china percentage of sales is due to our growing customer base  as well as our commitment to investing our resources in this growing region 
korean revenues as a percentage of total revenues declined due to our efforts to enrich our product mix and focus on selling products with higher margins 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit for compared to was due to increased revenues  improved product mix and higher factory utilization 
approximately of the gross profit increase was due to increased revenues  with the remaining increase due to the improved product mix and factory utilization 
for  gross profit includes a net sales reserve release of million and a net inventory charge of million recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  in connection with our restructuring actions 
for  gross profit includes sales reserves of million and inventory reserves of million in connection with product discontinuations as a result of our various restructuring actions 
operating expenses 
r d and sg a expenses were both flat as a percentage of sales for as compared to the decrease in amortization of acquisition related intangibles is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of restructuring and impairments 
in order to better align our cost structure with our revenues  we continually consider the rationalization of both our manufacturing operations and our workforce levels 
as a result  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges included million of costs associated with the closure of our six inch fab in mountaintop  pennsylvania  million of net costs associated with the closure of our four inch south portland  maine wafer fab  million in employee separation costs relating to our infrastructure realignment program  million of costs associated with the closure of our kuala lumpur  malaysia plant  and million of asset impairment charges related to the discontinuation of our memory product line 
in addition  we released million in reserves primarily associated with the restructuring program 
the charges associated with the mountaintop and south portland fabs  and the kuala lumpur plant were the remaining charges from our restructuring plan announced in july the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges included million of employee separation costs for severance and other costs associated with workforce reduction actions undertaken during the year  including the closure of our six inch fab in mountaintop  the closure of the four inch fab in south portland  plant closures in wuxi  china and kuala lumpur and million of impairment  
table of contents decommissioning and other exit costs relating to the closure of our above referenced fab and plant closures  as well as asset impairment charges in bucheon  south korea 
total net costs for the closure of the six inch wafer fab in mountaintop were approximately million for severance and million for all other related costs and impairments 
this closure was considered substantially complete as of december  based on comparisons to our fourth quarter spending levels  the closure of the mountaintop six inch fab is expected to save us approximately million annually in manufacturing costs  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees 
total net costs for the south portland closure were approximately million in severance and million in asset impairments and other exit costs including decommissioning and technology transfer costs 
this closure was considered substantially complete as of december  the south portland four inch fab closure is expected to save us approximately million annually in manufacturing costs  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees 
total net costs for the wuxi and kuala lumpur closures were approximately million in severance and million in asset impairments and other exit costs including decommissioning and technology transfer costs 
both of these closures were considered substantially complete as of december  these closures resulted in savings of approximately million annually in manufacturing costs beginning in  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately  employees 
we determined in that there were certain wafer fabrication assets located in bucheon for which the carrying amount exceeded the expected undiscounted cash flow from their use 
accordingly  a charge of million was recorded to reflect these long lived assets at their fair value  based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
these asset impairments reduced depreciation costs by approximately million annually 
total charges for ongoing infrastructure realignment in were million  which allowed us to achieve approximately million in savings on an annualized basis 
the infrastructure realignment program actions announced in impacted both manufacturing and non manufacturing personnel  primarily in the united states  and are expected to be completed in the second quarter of as a result of the million charged  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees  we anticipate cost savings of approximately million in manufacturing and non manufacturing costs on an annualized basis beginning in reserve for potential settlement losses 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million as a reserve for potential settlement losses 
see item  note of this report for further information 
purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development ipr d was million for in  ipr d resulted from the purchase of raytheon s non military rf components business completed in the fourth quarter of interest expense 
interest expense decreased in due to the redemption of million of the senior subordinated notes on june  this redemption was partially offset by interest on our million term loan 
interest income 
the increase in interest income in is due to the increase in average cash  short term and long term marketable securities balances and improved rates of return earned on those balances as compared to other expense 
in  we recorded a charge of million related to losses associated with strategic investments 
during  we recorded other expense of million associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our revolving line of credit 
these costs included million for the call premium on the senior subordinated notes and other transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering and revolving line of credit 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was on income before taxes of million and on loss before taxes of million for and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate in as 
table of contents compared to is primarily due to changes in the magnitude and location of taxable income among taxing jurisdictions 
changes in the location of taxable income loss can result in significant changes in the effective tax rate 
an additional valuation allowance against deferred taxes in the amount of million was also recorded in reportable segments 
comparative disclosures of revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments are as follows year ended december  december  gross gross revenue of total profit revenue of total profit dollars in millions power discrete power analog standard products total power discrete 
power discrete revenue increased nearly in  as compared to revenue growth came across all products  particularly in high power and low power products 
increases in average selling prices grew revenues  while unit volumes accounted for of the revenue increase 
this was driven by the transition from limited demand in to a limited supply in  enabling greater pricing leverage and product mix 
we experienced particular growth in our newer products  including mosfets  using our powertrench iii and powertrench iv processes  and our spm tm products  which both contributed to the increase 
revenue growth was strongest in china and taiwan  which together accounted for approximately half of power discrete revenues 
in the second half of  demand slowed  particularly in the low power products  as computing and cell phone demand slowed and the supply chain had been replenished with adequate inventory 
gross profits increased due to an improved product mix of higher margin and new technology products  favorable market conditions  and conversion to our newer powertrench technologies  which have significantly lower die costs 
in  gross profit includes a release of million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products 
in  gross profit includes million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively 
the and charges are both associated with our restructuring actions 
power discrete had operating income of million in compared to million in the increase in operating income was a result of the improved gross profits discussed above 
r d expenses  as well as sg a expenses  were roughly flat 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles decreased due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized 
power analog 
power analog revenues increased approximately in  as compared to strong unit growth grew revenues  while lower average selling prices decreased revenues in revenue growth occurred in virtually all product groups allowing us to increase our overall market share  particularly our power conversion product lines which grew approximately  as compared to  with the majority of growth coming in its fps tm product portfolio 
system power revenue grew approximately driven by increases in its ultra portable segment and last time buy activity on the de emphasized heritage businesses 
signal path analog products grew approximately in over  led by nearly growth in the analog and digital switches product groups 
strength in customer demand began late in the third quarter of and continued through the second quarter of as the supply chain was replenished and built up inventory levels 
gross profits also grew significantly as compared to  primarily due to the higher revenue levels  but also as a result of a better product mix and higher factory utilization on the increased unit volumes 
mix improvement resulted from larger portions of newer high margin products like green fps tm power switches and other low power ultra portable and signal products versus older lower margin  less differentiated products 
in  gross profit includes a charge release of million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  
table of contents respectively  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
in  gross profit includes million of sales reserves recorded in revenue and million of inventory charges recorded in cost of sales  both associated with our restructuring actions 
power analog had operating income loss of million in compared to million in the increase in operating income improved commensurate with the gross profit improvements 
r d was roughly flat 
sg a expenses increased proportionately with the increase in revenues  and included incremental technical sales support of our new products in the united states and china 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles decreased as certain intangibles became fully amortized 
standard products 
standard products revenue declined approximately in  as compared to a decline in average selling prices drove revenue down  while an increase in unit volumes grew revenues 
the decline in average selling prices was due to reduced demand for standard linear and opto lighting products 
the decline in revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in revenues from the memory  led  and standard linear businesses offset somewhat by an increase in revenues from the sdt product line 
the memory decline in was due to the phase out of that business  which was completed at the end of the second quarter of standard products gross profit increased as compared to due to improved pricing and product mix as well as increased factory utilization 
in  standard products gross profit includes a charge release of million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our and restructuring actions 
in  standard products gross profit includes million of sales reserves recorded in revenue and million of inventory charges recorded in cost of sales  both associated with our restructuring actions 
standard products had operating income of million in compared to million in the increase in operating income was a result of the gross profit improvements as well as decreases in sg a and r d expenses 
sg a expenses decreased due to the consolidation of selling functions and the discontinuation of allocated expenses to the memory product line 
r d expenses decreased due to the elimination of spending on memory related products as well as a refocus of r d spending resources to our strategic power related product development 
in process research and development we incurred charges for in process research and development of million in these charges were considered immaterial for liquidity and capital resources we have a borrowing capacity of million on a revolving basis for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  under our senior credit facility 
at december   after adjusting for outstanding letters of credit we had up to million available under this senior credit facility 
at december   we had additional outstanding letters of credit of million that do not fall under the senior credit facility 
at december   we also had million of undrawn credit facilities at certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
these amounts outstanding do not impact available borrowings under the senior credit facility 
our senior credit facility  which includes the million term loan and the million revolving line of credit  the indenture governing our convertible senior subordinated notes  and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future  impose various restrictions and contain various covenants which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
the restrictive covenants include limitations on consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  creating liens  paying dividends or making other similar restricted payments  asset sales  capital expenditures and incurring indebtedness  among other restrictions 
the covenants in the senior credit facility also include financial measures such as a minimum interest coverage ratio  a maximum senior leverage ratio and a minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures measure 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the senior credit facility also limits our ability to modify our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  or enter into shareholder agreements  voting trusts or similar arrangements 
under our debt instruments  the subsidiaries of fairchild semiconductor corporation cannot be restricted  except to a limited extent  from paying dividends or 
table of contents making advances to fairchild semiconductor corporation 
we believe that funds to be generated from operations  together with existing cash  will be sufficient to meet our debt obligations over the next twelve months 
we expect that existing cash and available funds from our senior credit facility and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements and to fund our research and development and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we had capital expenditures of million in we frequently evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders or restructure our long term debt to further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional borrowing or equity investment may be required to fund future acquisitions 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million from december  as of december   our short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities were million and million  respectively  a decrease of million and million  respectively  as compared to december  included in the short term marketable securities are auction rate securities in which we invest to help maintain liquidity 
these securities have long term underlying maturities  but are sold in a market which is highly liquid with interest rates reset based on an auction process every   or days 
our intent is to not hold these underlying securities to maturity but to take advantage of this interest rate reset feature and active auction process to provide short term liquidity for the company at advantageous yields when compared to cash equivalents 
as of december   we held million of auction rate securities  a decrease of million from december  during  our operations provided million in cash compared to million of cash in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a net loss in exclusive of the non cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance expense in comparison to income in also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities are changes in current liabilities 
the decreases in current liabilities were due primarily to reductions in payroll and other operating accruals  accounts payable  and a decrease in interest payable due to the payoff on the notes 
offsetting these decreases was the change in inventory as we focused on reduced internal inventories 
in addition  depreciation expense was reduced due to the adjustment of certain estimated useful life assumptions in the third quarter of cash provided by used in investing activities during totaled million compared to million in the change resulted primarily from reduced purchases of marketable securities  higher sales of marketable investments and reductions in capital expenditures

this retirement liability was million as of december  
table of contents represents future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases 
capital purchase obligations represent commitments for purchase of plant and equipment 
they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of december   as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities other than debt obligations  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
it is customary practice in the semiconductor industry to enter into guaranteed purchase commitments or take or pay arrangements for purchases of certain equipment and raw materials 
obligations under these arrangements are included in above 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant at december  and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
liquidity and capital resources of fairchild international  excluding subsidiaries fairchild semiconductor international  inc is a holding company  the principal asset of which is the stock of its sole subsidiary  fairchild semiconductor corporation 
fairchild semiconductor international  inc on a stand alone basis had no cash flow from operations and has no cash requirements for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition  sales reserves  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and loss contingencies 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies  including those related to revenue recognition  sales reserves  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results in the amount and timing of our actual results for any period could occur if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
revenue recognition and sales reserves 
no revenue is recognized unless there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of semiconductor products is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  which is generally when the product is received by the customer 
in some cases  title and risk of loss do not pass to the customer when the product is received by them 
in these cases  we recognize 
table of contents revenue at the time when title and risk of loss is transferred  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
these cases include several inventory locations where we manage consigned inventory for our customers  some of which is at customer facilities 
in such cases  revenue is not recognized when products are received at these locations  rather  revenue is recognized when customers take the inventory from the location for their use 
we also receive revenues from manufacturing wafers under contracts with other semiconductor suppliers  such as national semiconductor and samsung electronics  who have sold us their wafer manufacturing facilities and require a continued source of wafer supply after the sales 
contract manufacturing revenue is recorded at the time title to the wafer and risk of loss passes to the customer  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
shipping costs billed to our customers are included within revenue 
associated costs are classified in cost of goods sold 
approximately of our revenue is generated through the use of distributors 
distributor payments are due under agreed terms and are not contingent upon resale or any other matter other than the passage of time 
we have agreements with some distributors and customers for various programs  including prompt payment discounts  pricing protection  scrap allowances and stock rotation 
in general  credits allowed under these programs are capped based upon individual distributor agreements 
we record charges associated with these programs as a reduction of revenue based upon historical activity 
we also have volume based incentives with certain distributors to encourage stronger resales of our products 
reserves are recorded as a reduction to revenue as they are earned by the distributor 
our policy is to use a three to six month rolling historical experience rate in order to estimate the necessary allowance to be recorded 
in addition  the products sold by us are subject to a limited product quality warranty 
we accrue for estimated incurred but unidentified quality issues based upon historical activity and known quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the standard limited warranty period is one year 
quality returns are accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimated sales reserves and actual results 
inventory valuation 
in determining the net realizable value of our inventories  we review the valuations of inventory considered excessively old  and therefore subject to  obsolescence and inventory in excess of customer backlog 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when estimated actual cost is significantly different than standard cost and to value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
once established  write downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or more frequently  if indicators of potential impairment arise 
our impairment review process is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  which uses our estimates of revenues  driven by market growth rates and estimated costs  as well as utilizing a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with our cost of capital and the risk inherent in our current business model 
for all other long lived assets  our impairment review process is based upon an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process  obsolete 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
future undiscounted cash flows include estimates of future revenues  driven by market growth rates  and estimated future costs 

table of contents income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred taxes are not provided for the undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas 
we make judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on the belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence 
future realization of the tax benefit of existing deductible temporary differences or carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback and carryforward period available under the tax law 
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projections of future taxable income excluding reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to preserve the deferred tax asset may be considered to identify possible sources of taxable income 
valuation allowances have been established for us deferred tax assets  which we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
if we are ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income from continuing operations  additional paid in capital or to other comprehensive income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes would be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
uncertainties are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
loss contingencies 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
changes in our evaluation could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as we believe  we expect  we intend  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  plans  estimates  anticipates  or hopeful  or the negative of those terms or other comparable terms  or by discussions of our strategy  plans or future performance 
for example  the outlook section below contains numerous forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements in this report are made based on management s current expectations and estimates  which involve risks and uncertainties  including those described below and more specifically in the business risks section 
among these factors are the following changes in regional or global 
table of contents economic or political conditions including as a result of terrorist attacks and responses to them  changes in demand for our products  changes in inventories at our customers and distributors  technological and product development risks  availability of manufacturing capacity  availability of raw materials  competitors actions  loss of key customers  including but not limited to distributors  order cancellations or reduced bookings  changes in manufacturing yields or output  and significant litigation 
factors that may affect our operating results are described in the business risks section in the quarterly and annual reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to be materially different from those in the forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
policy on business outlook disclosure and quiet periods it is our current policy to update our business outlook at least twice each quarter 
the first update is near the beginning of each quarter  within the press release that announces the previous quarter s results 
the second update is within a press release issued approximately two months into each quarter 
the business outlook below is consistent with the outlook included in our january  press release announcing fourth quarter and full year results  as updated in our press release dated march  the current business outlook is accessible at the investor relations section of our website at http investor 
fairchildsemi 
com 
toward the end of each quarter  and until that quarter s results are publicly announced  we observe a quiet period  when the outlook is not updated to reflect management s current expectations 
the quiet period for the first quarter of will be from march  to april   when we plan to release our first quarter results 
except during quiet periods  the business outlook posted on our website reflects current guidance unless and until updated through a press release  sec filing or other public announcement 
during quiet periods  our business outlook  as posted on our website  announced in press releases and provided in quarterly  annual and special reports or other filing with the sec  should be considered to be historical  speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update by the company 
during quiet periods  fairchild semiconductor representatives will not comment about the business outlook of the company s financial results or expectations 
outlook for the first quarter of  we expect revenues to increase approximately from the fourth quarter of  based on our backlog position and end market demand 
in the first quarter  we expect gross margins to benefit from the full effect of lower depreciation expense  higher factory utilization and improving product mix 
in addition  our fiscal calendar includes weeks in  with the extra week falling in the first quarter of for fiscal year  we expect our sales to grow at or above the market rate for our analog and power businesses  while our standard products will be roughly flat to down a few percentage points compared to we also are committed to improving gross margins into the range by the end of the year 
we anticipate our r d and sg a expenses  exclusive of stock based compensation expense  as a percent of sales  to increase slightly compared to this is primarily due to higher anticipated bonus accruals  compared to where no bonus was paid  as well as increased investments in r d and field application engineers in our sales force 
in addition  we forecast that capital spending will remain in the of sales range during  and an effective tax rate to continue to be estimated at 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will begin expensing stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
we anticipate that the related expense will be approximately million in the first quarter of  with a similar quarterly run rate throughout the year 
recently issued financial accounting standards in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
 and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires the retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning 
table of contents after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin no 
clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
this statement permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
the modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a for all prior periods presented or b for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
this statement is required to be adopted effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal we adopted sfas no 
r in fiscal year on december  using the modified prospective method see also item  note for further discussion 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material affect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
we use currency forward and combination option contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange denominated revenues and expenses 
similar instruments have also been used to hedge firm commitments and anticipated transactions 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do conduct these activities by way of transactions denominated in other currencies  primarily the korean won  malaysian ringgit  philippine peso  chinese yuan  japanese yen  british pound  and the euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in other foreign exchange rates  we 
table of contents have established hedging programs 
we utilize currency option contracts and forward contracts in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  during the twelve months ended december   an adverse change defined as a unfavorable move in every currency where we have exposure in the exchange rates of all currencies over the course of the year would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately million 
we have no interest rate exposure due to rate changes for the convertible senior subordinated notes 
however  we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the senior credit facility due to the variable london interbank offered rate libor pricing for both the term loan and the revolving credit facility 
for example  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of million for the revolving credit facility  assuming all borrowing capability was utilized 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of million for the million term loan 
the increased annual interest expense due to a basis point increase in libor rates would be offset by an increase in interest income of million on the average invested cash and investment balances during there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility at december  or at any point during from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  primarily to reduce interest rate exposure 
as of december   we had no such instruments in place
