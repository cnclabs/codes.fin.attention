overview our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers 
the products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors  publishers  and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites 
generally  we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties 
we offer services such as amazon enterprise solutions  co branded credit cards  and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers 
our financial focus is on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low  offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists 
to increase sales  we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience  including lowering prices  improving availability  offering faster delivery times  increasing selection  expanding product information  improving ease of use  and earning customer trust 
we generally focus on gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than margin percentages 
because we have deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards  the free cash flow impact from income taxes paid is less than our income tax provision 
we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes  such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders 
we moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees 
restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods  net of estimated cancellations 
total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were million at december   compared with million at december  and million at december  these totals include all stock awards outstanding  without regard for estimated forfeitures  consisting of vested and unvested awards  and in the money and out of the money stock options 
we seek to reduce our customer experience variable costs per unit and work to leverage our customer experience fixed costs 
our customer experience variable costs include product costs  payment processing and related transaction costs  picking  packaging  and preparing orders for shipment  transportation  customer service support  and most aspects of our marketing costs 
our customer experience fixed costs include the costs necessary to build  enhance  and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers 
variable costs generally change directly with sales volume  while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs  geographic expansion  and other factors 
to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers  we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing  maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes 
to minimize growth in fixed costs  we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 
free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets  including capitalized internal use software and website development  both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a negative operating cycle on average  our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due 
inventory turnover was   and for   and we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors  including our product mix  our mix of third party sales  our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability  our future investment in new geographies and product lines  and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 
accounts payable days were   and for  and we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors  including the mix of product sales  the mix of third party sales  the mix of suppliers  seasonality  and changes in payment terms over time  including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms 
our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency  enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us and invest in several areas of technology including seller platforms  search  web services  and digital initiatives 
we believe that advances in technology  specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power  the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home  and the advances of wireless connectivity  will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people s lives 
our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 
our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends 
for example  if the us dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations  our consolidated net sales  gross profit  and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant 
likewise  if the us dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations  our consolidated net sales  gross profit  and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant 
we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term 
we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 
in addition  the remeasurement of our peacs and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates 
currency volatilities may continue  which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons
