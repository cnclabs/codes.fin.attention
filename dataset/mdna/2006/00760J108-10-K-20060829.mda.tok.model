overview the company was founded in to develop and manufacture burn in and test equipment for the semiconductor industry 
since its inception  the company has sold more than  systems to semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor contract assemblers and burn in and test service companies worldwide 
the company s principal products currently are the mtx massively parallel test system  the max burn in system and the fox full wafer contact parallel test and burn in system  the diepak carrier and test fixtures 
the company s net sales consist primarily of sales of systems  die carriers  test fixtures  upgrades and spare parts and revenues from service contracts 
the company s selling arrangements may include contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
as a result  effective june   to comply with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment and defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs 
the amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the fair value of the undelivered element or the contractual agreed to amounts 
in accordance with this revenue recognition policy  when multiple elements or deliverables exist  the company allocates the purchase price based on vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value and defers revenue recognition on the undelivered portions or elements 
historically  these multiple deliverables have included items such as extended support provisions  training to be supplied after delivery of the systems  and test programs specific to customers routine applications 
test programs can be written either by the customer  other firms or by the company 
the amount of revenue deferred in connection with an undelivered element is the greater of the fair value of the undelivered element or the contractually agreed to amount 
royalty revenue related to licensing income from performance test boards and burn in boards is recognized when paid by a licensee 
this income is recorded in net sales 
provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty and installation are recorded at the time the products are shipped 
a substantial portion of the company s net sales is derived from the sale of products to overseas markets 
consequently  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of the company s products compared to products sold by companies using the local currency in such markets 
although most sales to european customers are denominated in us dollars  substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
the length of time between receipt of order and ultimate payment typically ranges from six to twelve months 
the exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge these or other currency risks  but it may do so in the future 
the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt or other obligations due to the company that may be denominated in either yen or us dollars 
the company s terms of sales with distributors are fob shipping point with payment due within days 
the only right of return is if the equipment does not meet the published specifications 
all products go through in house testing and verification of specifications before shipment 
apart from warranty reserves  credits issued have not been material as a percentage of net sales 
the company s distributors do not carry inventories of our products 
instead  the distributors place orders with the company at or about the time they receive orders from their customers 
the company s shipment terms to our distributors do not provide for credits or right of return 
because the company s distributors do not carry inventories of our products  they do not have rights to price protection or to return products 
at the time the company ships products to the distributors  the price is fixed 
subsequent to the issuance of the invoice  there are no discounts or special terms 
paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  is not applicable because the company does not give the buyer the right to return the product or to receive future price concessions 
the company s arrangements do not include vendor consideration as described in emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes its systems software development costs incurred after a system achieves technological feasibility and before first commercial shipment 
such costs typically represent a small portion of total research and development costs 
no system software development costs were capitalized or amortized in fiscal  or critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company follows very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue in accordance with sab  revenue recognition  however  certain judgments affect the application of the policy 
for example  the company s revenue recognition policy is affected by estimated reductions to revenue for special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty obligations the company provides and records the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
the company s estimate of warranty reserve is based on management assessment of future warranty obligations and on historical warranty obligations 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could affect how the company accounts for expenses 
inventory obsolescence in each of the last three fiscal years  the company has written down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
investment impairment the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
the company has recorded investment impairments when it believed that the investment had experienced a decline in value that was other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosures of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosures of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at may  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company invests excess cash in a managed portfolio of corporate and government bond instruments with maturities of months or less 
the company does not use any financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
the company  however  enters into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent that the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks 
in addition  the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt or other obligations due to the company that may be denominated in either yen or us dollars 
since the japanese subsidiary s financial statements are based in yen and the company s consolidated financial statements are based in us dollars  the japanese subsidiary and the company recognize foreign exchange gain or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of the yen as compared with the us dollar would not be expected to result in a significant change in the net income or loss
