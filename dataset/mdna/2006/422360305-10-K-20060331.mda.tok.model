at december  approximately million  representing principal on the tranche a  b  c  d  e and f loans was outstanding 
see recent developments below for a discussion of the amended and restated siemens agreements 
the siemens credit agreement imposes certain financial and other covenants on the company which are customary for loans of this size and nature  including restrictions on the conduct of the company s business  the incurrence of indebtedness  merger or sale of assets  the modification of material agreements  changes in capital structure  making certain payments and paying dividends

in addition  a material breach of the supply agreement between the company and siemens may be declared to be a breach of the credit agreement and siemens would have the right to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility immediately due and payable 
any non compliance with the supply agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and continued operations 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the credit facility s covenants and the supply agreement 
during  the working capital deficit decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease in the deficit is attributable to an excess of approximately million in cash from operations and financing activities over cash used for investing activities offset by an increase in current maturities of long term debt  convertible subordinated notes and subordinated notes of approximately million 
the working capital deficit of million includes approximately million representing the current maturities of the long term debt to siemens which may be repaid through preferred pricing reductions and approximately  million in current maturities  net of million of debt discount related to the million convertible subordinated notes that can be repaid by either cash or stock  at the option of the company 
in  the company generated income from operations of approximately million compared to million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  were approximately million 
net cash from operating activities in increased approximately million compared to  which is mainly attributable to the reduction of million in the company s net loss from to reductions in cash flows in from resulted from the timing in the collection of our december capitation payment of approximately  from kaiser permanente  collected in early january as opposed to december in  and the payment of january rents before the end of the fiscal year in compared to after fiscal year end in  due to the timing of the company s accounting calendar 
these reductions were however offset by corresponding increases in cash flows from increases in accounts payable and accrued salaries  due to timing in payments 
other sources of funds in were the proceeds from the divestiture of some centers of approximately million  the exercise of warrants of approximately million and the issuance of long term debt of million to siemens in december and of approximately million net of  issuing cost to purchasers of subordinated notes in august of proceeds from the issuance of the subordinated notes were used to redeem the million series e convertible preferred stock

the use of funds for dividends on preferred stock reduced from million to  as included additional payments necessary to pay off accrued and unpaid dividends  in accordance with the company s agreement with the holders of the series e convertible preferred stock 
the company believes that current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations  at current net revenue levels  will be sufficient to support the company s operational needs through the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that the company can maintain compliance with the siemens loan covenants  that net revenue levels will remain at or higher than current levels or that unexpected cash needs will not arise for which the cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will not be sufficient 
in the event of a shortfall in cash  the company might consider short term debt  or additional equity or debt offerings 
there can be no assurance however  that such financing will be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
the company also is continuing its aggressive cost controls and sales and gross margin improvements

we have restructured the outstanding million indebtedness of the company to siemens under the original credit agreement 
the new facility is for a total of million  including the currently outstanding million and is structured in three tranches 
the effect of the amended credit facility has been recorded as if it had occurred on december  the new tranche a  with a principal balance of approximately million and imputed interest of per annum  is payable in three quarterly installments of  commencing with the first quarter of the payments are subject to rebate credits as described below

additional loans may be made to the company under tranche c for certain acquisitions 
the monthly installment payments are intended to repay approximately million of the tranche c principal balance 
the remaining principal balances of tranche c  as well as tranche a and tranche b  with interest  will continue to be eligible for repayment utilizing rebates on purchases of hearing aids from siemens  provided that the company purchases  under the amended supply agreement  certain percentages of the hearing aids it sells 
the amended credit agreement also contemplates that the company will reduce the tranche c loan balance by making annual payments in an amount equal to of excess cash flow as defined in the agreement  and by paying to siemens of proceeds from future equity offerings 
substantially all of the company s assets collateralize the notes payable to siemens 
pursuant to the amended supply agreement  the company agreed to purchase from siemens certain minimum percentages of the company s hearing aid purchases for a period of five years 
a material breach of the amended supply agreement may be declared to be a breach of the amended credit agreement and siemens would have the right to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility immediately due and payable 
any non compliance with the amended supply agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and continued operations 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements goodwill the majority of the company s goodwill resulted from the combination with helix 
on at least an annual basis  the company is required to assess whether its goodwill is impaired 
the company elected to perform this analysis on the first day of its fourth quarter 
in order to do this  management applied judgment in determining its reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the company s business 
the reporting units determined by management are the centers  the network and e commerce 
the definition of the reporting units affects the company s goodwill impairment assessments 
the annual goodwill impairment assessment involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment charge 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
the company utilized an independent appraisal firm to test goodwill for impairment as of the first day of the company s fourth quarter during and  and each of these tests indicated no impairment 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by applying a weighted average of three methods quoted market price  external transactions  and discounted cash flow 
significant changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions  stock price  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of audiological products are recognized at the time of delivery 
revenues from hearing care services are recognized at the time those services are performed 
the company has capitation contracts with certain health care organizations under which the company is paid an amount for each enrollee of the health maintenance organization to provide to the enrollee a once every three years discount on certain hearing products and services 
the amount paid to the company by the healthcare organization is calculated on a per capita basis and is referred to as capitation revenue 
capitation revenue is earned as a result of agreeing to provide services to members without regard to the actual amount of service provided  revenue is recorded in the period that the beneficiaries are entitled to hearing care services 
allowance for doubtful accounts certain of the accounts receivable of the company are from health insurance and managed care organizations and government agencies 
these organizations could take up to nine months before paying a claim made by the company and also impose a limit on the time the claim can be billed 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
in order to calculate that allowance  the company first identifies any known uncollectible amounts in its accounts receivable listing and charges them against the existing allowance for doubtful accounts 
then a specific percent per plan and per aging categories is applied against the remaining receivables to estimate the needed allowance 
any changes in the percent assumptions per plan and aging categories results in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  an increase of in the percent applied against the remaining receivables would increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  sales returns the company provides to all patients purchasing hearing aids a specific return period of at least days if the patient is dissatisfied with the product 
the company provides an allowance in accrued expenses for returns 
the return period can be extended to days if the patient attends the company s help program 
the company calculates its allowance for returns using estimates based upon actual historical returns 
the cost of the hearing aid is reimbursed to the company by the manufacturer

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not engage in derivative transactions 
the company does become exposed to foreign currency transactions as a result of its operations in canada 
the company does not hedge such exposure 
differences in the fair value of investment securities are not material  therefore  the related market risk is not significant
