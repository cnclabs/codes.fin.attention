such forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and include estimates and assumptions related to the company s growth and economic  competitive  legislative and regulatory developments 
these forward looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty which are  in many instances  beyond the company s control and have been made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on harleysville group 
there can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with management s expectations so that the effect of future developments on harleysville group will be those anticipated by management 
actual f inancial results  including premium growth and underwriting results could differ materially from those anticipated by harleysville group depending on the outcome of certain factors  which may include changes in property and casualty loss trends and reserves  catastrophe losses  competition in insurance product pricing  government regulation and changes therein which may impede the ability to charge adequate rates  performance of the financial markets  fluctuations in interest rates  availability and price of reinsurance  the best s rating of harleysville group  and the status of labor markets in which the company operates 
overview the company s net income is primarily determined by three elements net premium income investment income amounts paid or reserved to settle insured claims positive variations in premium income are subject to a number of factors  including limitations on rates arising from the competitive market place or regulation limitation on available business arising from a need to maintain the quality of underwritten risks the company s ability to maintain its a excellent rating by am best the ability of the company to maintain a reputation for efficiency and fairness in claims administration positive variations on investment income are subject to a number of factors  including general interest rate levels specific adverse events affecting the issuers of debt obligations held by the company changes in the prices of equity securities generally and those held by the company specifically loss and loss settlement expenses are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of the risks underwritten by the company the nature and severity of catastrophic losses the availability  cost and terms of reinsurance underlying settlement costs  including medical and legal costs the company seeks to manage each of the foregoing to the extent within its control 
many of the foregoing factors are partially  or entirely  outside of the control of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require harleysville group to make estimates and assumptions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
harleysville group believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation 
the judgments  or the methodology on which the judgments are made  are reviewed quarterly with the audit committee 
liabilities for losses and loss settlement expenses 
the liability for losses and loss settlement expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims which have not yet been reported to harleysville group 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily upon a case by case evaluation of the type of risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss settlement expense reserves are determined utilizing historical information by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated on a regular basis using the most r ecent information on reported claims and a variety of actuarial techniques 
it is expected that such estimates will be more or less than the amounts ultimately paid when the claims are settled 
changes in these estimates are reflected in current operations 
investments 
generally  unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
however  if the fair value of an investment declines below its cost and that decline is deemed other than temporary  the amount of the decline below cost is charged to earnings 
harleysville group monitors its investment portfolio and reviews investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost each quarter to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
such evaluations consider  among other things  the magnitude and reasons for a decline  the prospects for the fair value to recover in the near term and harleysville group s ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value 
future adverse investment market conditions  or poor operating results of underlying investments  could result in an impairment charge in the future 
harleysville group has written down to fair value  without exception  any equity security that has declined below cost by more than and maintained such decline for six months  or by or more  in the quarter in which either such decline occurred 
in some cases  securities that have declined by a lesser amount or for a shorter period of time are written down if the evaluation indicates the decline is other than temporary 
fair value of equity securities is based on the closing market value as reported by a national securities exchange or nasdaq 
the fair value of fixed maturities is based upon data supplied by an independent pricing service 
it can be difficult to determine the fair value of non traded securities but harleysville group does not own a material amount of non traded securities 
policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting and agency expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business  are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies and in proportion to the premiums earned 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
the estimation of net realizable value takes into account the premium to be earned  related investment income over the claim paying period  expected losses and loss settlement expenses  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected losses and loss settlement expenses  may require adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs 
if the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the acquisition costs are unrecoverable  further analyses are completed to determine if a reserve is required to provide for losses that may exceed the related unearned premiums 
contingencies 
besides claims related to its insurance products  harleysville group is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
harleysville group assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will be consistent with those assessments 
the application of certain of these critical accounting policies to the years ended december  and is discussed in greater detail below 
results of operations harleysville group underwrites property and casualty insurance in both the personal and commercial lines of insurance 
the personal lines of insurance include both auto and homeowners  and the commercial lines include auto  commercial multi peril and workers compensation 
the business is marketed primarily in the eastern and midwestern united states through independent agents 
historically  harleysville group s results of operations have been influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general 
the operating results of the united states property and casualty insurance industry have been subject to significant variations due to competition  weather  catastrophic events  regulation  the availability and cost of satisfactory reinsurance  general economic conditions  judicial trends  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment 
harleysville group s premium growth and underwriting results have been  and continue to be  influenced by market conditions 
insurance industry price competition has often made it difficult both to obtain and to retain properly priced personal and commercial lines business 
it is management s policy to maintain its underwriting standards  even at the expense of premium growth 
the key elements of harleysville group s business model are the sales of properly priced and underwritten personal and commercial property and casualty insurance through independent agents and the investment of the premiums in a manner designed to assure that claims and expenses can be paid while providing a return on the capital employed 
loss trends and investment performance are critical factors in influencing the success of the business model 
these factors are affected by the factors impacting the insurance industry in general as described above and factors unique to harleysville group as described in the following discussion 
transactions with affiliates the company s property and casualty subsidiaries participate in a pooling agreement with mutual 
the pooling agreement provides for the allocation of premiums  losses  loss settlement expenses and underwriting expenses between harleysville group and mutual 
harleysville group is not liable for any pooled losses occurring prior to january   the date the pooling agreement became effective 
harleysville group s participation in the pool has been since january  because the pooling agreement does not relieve harleysville group of primary liability as the originating insurer  there is a concentration of credit risk arising from business ceded to mutual 
however  the pooling agreement provides for the right of offset and the amount of credit risk with mutual was not material at december  and mutual has an a 
m 
best rating of a excellent 
harleysville group has attempted to reduce the potential impact of future catastrophes by achieving greater geographic distribution of risks  reducing exposure in catastrophe prone areas and through reinsurance  including an agreement with mutual 
effective january   harleysville group entered into a reinsurance agreement with mutual whereby mutual  in return for a reinsurance premium  reinsured accumulated catastrophe losses up to million in a quarter for  and this reinsurance coverage was in excess of a retention of million in a quarter for  and the agreement excludes catastrophe losses resulting from earthquakes  terrorism or hurricanes  and supplements the existing external catastrophe reinsurance program 
under this agreement  harleysville group ceded to mutual premiums earned of million  million and million  and losses inc urred of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the premiums for this reinsurance were established in consultation with an independent actuarial firm 
the agreement was terminated december  and the coverage will not be replaced as it is no longer deemed necessary based on the current catastrophe risk profile 
harleysville ltd 
is a subsidiary of the company and leases the home office to mutual  which shares the facility with harleysville group 
rental income under the lease was million  million and million for  and  respectively  and is included in other income after elimination of intercompany amounts of million in  million in and million in the lease has been renewed for a five year term expiring december  and includes a formula for additional rent for any additions  improvements or renovations 
mutual is responsible for the building operating expenses including maintenance and repairs 
the pricing of the lease was based upon an appraisal obtained from an independent real estate appraiser 
harleysville group provides certain management services to mutual and other affiliates 
harleysville group received a fee of million  million and million in  and  respectively  for its services under these management agreements 
under related agreements  harleysville group serves as the paymaster for harleysville companies  with each company being charged for its proportionate share of salary and employee benefits expense based upon time allocation 
the level of fees has been approved by each state insurance department having jurisdiction 
intercompany balances are created primarily from the pooling arrangement settled quarterly  allocation of common expenses  collection of premium balances and payment of claims settled monthly 
no interest is charged or received on intercompany balances due to the timely settlement terms and nature of the items 
harleysville group borrowed million from mutual in connection with the acquisition of mid america and hic new york in it was a demand loan with a stated maturity in march which had been extended to march in february  the maturity was extended again to march and the interest rate became libor plus  which was a commercially reasonable market rate in interest expense on this loan was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
harleysville group has no material relationships with current or former members of management other than compensatory plans and arrangements disclosed or described in the company s public filings 
off balance sheet arrangements harleysville group has off balance sheet credit risk related to approximately million and million of premium balances due to mutual from agents and insureds at december  and  respectively 
mutual bills and collects such receivables on behalf of harleysville group for efficiency reasons 
harleysville group recognizes any associated bad debts  which have not been material 
compared to premiums earned increased million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in premiums earned for commercial lines of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in personal lines premiums earned 
the increase in premiums earned for commercial lines was primarily due to higher average premiums partially offset by fewer policy counts in the commercial automobile and workers compensation lines of business 
the decline in premiums earned for personal lines was primarily due to fewer policy counts 
the reduction in personal lines volume was driven primarily by a reduction of personal automobile business from the continued implementation of more stringent underwriting processes 
investment income increased million for the year ended december   resulting from an increase in invested assets partially offset by a lower yield on the fixed maturity investment portfolio 
realized investment gains decreased million for the year ended december   primarily resulting from gains on the sale of two equity securities in the first quarter of harleysville group holds securities with unrealized losses at december  as follows fair value unrealized loss length of unrealized loss less than months over months in thousands fixed maturities us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities total fixed maturities equity securities there are positions that comprise the unrealized loss in equity investments at december  all have had volatile price movements and have not been significantly below cost for significant continuous amounts of time 
harleysville group has been monitoring these securities and it is possible that some may be written down in the income statement in the future 
of the total fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss at december   securities with a fair value of million and an unrealized loss of million are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on the balance sheet while securities with a fair value of million and an unrealized loss of million are classified as held to maturity on the balance sheet and are carried at amortized cost 
the fixed maturity investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than twelve months were primarily due to the impact of the higher market interest rates rather than a decline in credit quality 
there are million in fixed maturity securities  at fair value  that at december   had been below amortized cost for over twelve months 
of the million of unrealized losses on such securities  million relates to securities which carry investment grade ratings and have declined in fair value roughly in line with market interest rate changes 
the remaining million of unrealized losses are comprised of airline enhanced equipment trust certificates eetc as follows cost fair value maturity date in thousands american airlines united airlines united airlines other airlines after the events of september   air travel and the value of these airlines eetc securities declined 
the eetcs are all a tranche holdings  which means they are in a senior credit position to the underlying airplane collateral value as compared to b and c tranche holders 
the investment in these securities generally took place between january and august the fair value of the eetcs reflects the market price of the securities provided by our custodian bank  the bank of new york  through an unaffiliated third party pricing service 
the collateral associated with the eetcs consists of large pools of late model aircraft  which are essential components of their carriers fleets 
at the time of issuance  the collateral was appraised at approximately twice the value of the a tranche eetcs 
the collateral securing the airline eetcs is attributed a val ue in excess of the security primarily as a result of common practice with respect to eetc collateral valuation 
the value of the collateral securing the eetcs is directly related to the current supply and demand for aircraft  and  because supply and demand for aircraft is affected by geopolitical events  the eetc market applies a credit buffer to the value of the collateral which is designed to build in a margin for the risk that future geopolitical events could have a severe economic impact on the airline industry in general and eetc issuers specifically 
according to the most recent august report provided by jp morgan  the market value of the aircraft collateral underlying the eetcs exceeds the cost of our a tranche holdings 
the report was prepared by jp morgan based on its own research as well as research from aviation specialists group 
the fair value of the eetcs has increased since  when the fair value first went below cost 
harleysville group currently has the ability and intent to continue to maintain its holdings in the eetc investments until maturity 
in february  holders of subordinate b tranche securities in the united airlines eetc exercised their right to invoke a mandatory purchase of all outstanding a tranche bonds with respect to the united airlines eetcs at par plus interest due and accrued 
as a result of this transaction  harleysville group received a principal payment of million  plus accrued interest  representing repayment of the united airlines eetc maturing in it is possible that the remaining eetcs may be written down in the income statement in the future  depending upon developments involving both the issuers and world events which impact the level of air travel 
income before income taxes increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in investment income and a lower underwriting loss  partially offset by lower realized investment gains 
the lower underwriting loss was primarily due to the change in the provision for insured events of prior years associated with lesser loss severity and lower property losses during an insurance company s statutory combined ratio is a standard measure of underwriting profitability 
this ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred losses and loss settlement expenses to net earned premium  the ratio of expenses incurred for commissions  premium taxes  administrative and other underwriting expenses to net written premium  and the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net earned premium 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  federal income taxes or other non operating income or expense 
a ratio of less than percent generally indicates underwriting profitability 
harleysville group s statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  such decrease was due to improved underwriting results in both commercial lines and personal lines  primarily resulting from improved loss experience and lower catastrophe losses in the improved loss experience reflects lower claim severity in general and lower claim frequency in property coverages 
the statutory combined ratios by line of business for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were as follows for the year ended december  commercial automobile workers compensation commercial multi peril other commercial total commercial personal automobile homeowners other personal total personal total personal and commercial the commercial lines statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lesser loss severity and lower property losses 
the personal lines statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the change in the provision for insured events of prior years associated with lesser loss severity

a reduction in commercial automobile severity in accident years and was observed during and led to the recognition of favorable development for those accident years in an increase in commercial automobile severity in accident years prior to was observed during and led to the recognition of adverse development for those accident years in in total  million in favorable development was recognized in the commercial automobile line during a reduction in workers compensation severity in accident years and was observed during and led to the recognition of favorable development for those accident years in an increase in workers compensation severity in accident years prior to was observed during and led to the recognition of adverse development for those accident years in in total  million in adverse development was recognized in the workers compensation line during a reduction in commercial multi peril severity in accident years and was observed during and led to the recognition of favorable development for those accident years in an increase in commercial multi peril severity in accident years prior to was observed during and led to the recognition of adverse development for those accident years in in total  million in favorable development was recognized in the commercial multi peril line during a reduction in both personal automobile and homeowners severity was broadly observed during and led to the recognition of favorable development for those lines of business in in total  million in favorable development was recognized in the personal automobile line and million in favorable development was recognized in the homeowners line during the following table presents workers compensation claim count information for the total pooled business in which harleysville group participates and payment amounts which are harleysville group s pooling share of the total pooled amounts for the year ended december for the year ended december  dollars in thousands number of claims pending  beginning of period number of claims reported number of claims settled or dismissed number of claims pending  end of period losses paid loss settlement expenses paid workers compensation losses primarily consist of indemnity and medical costs for injured workers 
the reduction in claim counts reflects the impact of a reduction in workers compensation exposure as policy counts have declined 
harleysville group records the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses incurred 
actuarial loss reserving techniques and assumptions  which rely on historical information as adjusted to reflect current conditions  have been consistently applied during the periods presented 
changes in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses reflect actual payments and evaluations of new information and data since the last reporting date 
these changes correlate with actuarial trends 
the following table presents case and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves by line of business and a statistically determined range of estimates of the ultimate unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses incurred for each line of business as of december  the range of estimates around the actuarial best estimates is statistically determined in order to provide information regarding the variability of the actuarial best estimates 
the statistical analysis is completed only on a basis that is net of reinsurance recoverables  as this appropriately reflects harleysville group s risk profile based on the type and quality of its reinsurance 
the ranges were determined using both paid and incurred loss development data with a  trial simulation run against each set of data 
development factors within each month development period were assumed to be normally distributed with the means equal to the es timated age to age factors and the standard deviations equal to the actual standard deviations of the data used 
the resulting ranges produced by the simulation were then used to create a reasonable representation of a confidence interval using the point as the low end of the range and the point as the high end of the range 
the total commercial lines range and total personal lines range were developed as separate simulations using the means and standard deviations of the individual lines as inputs 
therefore  the confidence interval for all lines of business is smaller than the straight sum of the individual lines of business intervals 
liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses at december  ibnr inc lae total liability statistically determined range of estimates case ibnr lae liability high low in thousands line of business commercial automobile workers compensation commercial multi peril other commercial total commercial personal automobile homeowners other personal total personal total net liability reinsurance recoverables gross liability reinsurance receivables were and million at december  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million  respectively or and  respectively  of the receivables were due from governmental bodies  regulatory agencies or quasi governmental pools and reinsurance facilities where  harleysville group believes  there is virtually no credit risk 
the increase in the amounts due from these types of pools and facilities is primarily based on an increase of million in the amount due from the national flood insurance program primarily as a result of claims arising from hurricane katrina 
the remainder of the reinsurance recoverables are principally due from reinsurers rated a or higher by the am best company 
because of the nature of insurance claims  there are uncertainties inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses 
harleysville group s reorganization of its claims operation in recent years has resulted in new people and processes involved in settling claims 
as a result  more recent statistical data reflects different patterns than in the past and gives rise to uncertainty as to the pattern of future loss settlements 
litigation on bodily injury liability cases is higher for the past four years while the rate of settlement is slower 
these changed patterns give rise to greater uncertainty as to the pattern of future loss settlements on bodily injury liability claims 
there are uncertainties regarding future loss cost trends particularly related to medical treatments and automobile repair 
court decisions  regulatory changes and economic conditions can affect the ultimate cost of claims that occurred in the past 
acco rdingly  the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses will likely differ from the amount recorded at december  the property and casualty industry has had substantial aggregate loss experience from claims related to asbestos related illnesses  environmental remediation  product liability  mold  and other uncertain exposures 
harleysville group has not experienced significant losses from such claims 
net catastrophe losses decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to less severe catastrophes impacting harleysville group in effective for one year from july   the company s subsidiaries and mutual and its wholly owned subsidiaries renewed its catastrophe reinsurance which provides coverage ranging from to of up to million in excess of a retention of million for any given catastrophe excluding terrorism for commercial lines 
harleysville group s pooling share of this coverage would range from to of up to million in excess of a retention of million for any given catastrophe 
pursuant to the terms of the treaty  the maximum recovery would be million for any catastrophe involving an insured loss equal to or greater than million 
harleysville group s pooling share of this maximum recovery would be million for any catastrophe involving an insured loss of million or greater 
the treat y includes reinstatement provisions providing for coverage for a second catastrophe and requiring payment of an additional premium in the event of a first catastrophe occurring 
harleysville group and mutual have purchased property per risk excess of loss reinsurance which covers certain terrorism losses and provides for recovery of up to million in excess of million of terrorism losses for any one risk under certain circumstances 
the maximum recovery by harleysville group on a terrorism loss occurrence is million 
the income tax expense for the year ended december  includes the tax benefit of million associated with tax exempt income compared to million in the prior year 
underwriting expenses  including amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
severance charges of million and million were incurred in and  respectively  related to ongoing expense reduction initiatives 
the remaining increase in underwriting expenses was primarily due to higher incentive costs for agents and employees 
other expense decreased million for the year ended december  primarily related to the write off of capitalized costs for a software project during the year ended december  harleysville group and mutual agreed on august  to terminate the reinsurance agreement whereby mutual reinsures certain accumulated catastrophe losses as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the agreement was terminated on december  the coverage will not be replaced as it is no longer deemed necessary based on our current catastrophe risk profile 
harleysville group ceded to mutual premiums earned of million and million and losses incurred of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively related to this agreement 
in january  harleysville group announced that it will freeze its defined benefit pension plan at current benefit levels as of march   and that it will enhance its k retirement savings plan to provide for a company contribution equal to of salary for all eligible employees  effective april  as a result of these changes  harleysville group expects to reduce annualized operating expenses by approximately million 
in connection with the freeze of the defined benefit plan  a curtailment charge of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of a curtailment benefit of approximately million will be recognized in the first quarter of in connection with the freeze of the supplemental executive retirement plan as of march  harleysville group expects  subject to shareholder approval  to make enhancements to its incentive compensation programs for employees in that will result in approximately million of additional annualized expense 
compared to premiums earned increased million  or for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in premiums earned for commercial lines of million  or  partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in personal lines premiums earned 
the increase in premiums earned for commercial lines primarily was due to higher rates partially offset by fewer policy counts 
the decline in policy counts was primarily in the workers compensation line of business 
the decrease in premiums earned for personal lines primarily was due to fewer policy counts 
the reduction in personal lines volume was driven primarily by a reduction in personal automobile business from the continued implementation of more stringent underwriting processes 
investment income increased million for the year ended december   resulting from an increase in invested assets  partially offset by a lower yield on the fixed maturity investment portfolio 
realized investment gains losses improved million for the year ended december   primarily resulting from gains on the sale of equity securities 
there were impairment charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
harleysville group had gross realized losses of million in which were from the sales of securities which had not declined by more than below their cost for more than six months at the time of their sale 
income loss before income taxes increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same prior year period 
the increase was primarily due to a lesser underwriting loss and greater realized investment gains 
the lesser underwriting loss was primarily due to lesser loss frequency in the current accident year  lower catastrophe losses and a decrease in the provision for insured events in prior years 
the provision for insured events in prior years was million of net adverse development compared to million of net adverse development in harleysville group s statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  such decrease was due to improved underwriting results in both commercial lines and personal lines  primarily resulting from the lower loss development and lower catastrophe losses 
the statutory combined ratios by line of business for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were as follows for the year ended december  commercial automobile workers compensation commercial multi peril other commercial total commercial personal automobile homeowners other personal total personal total personal and commercial statutory pension expense totaled million in and million in  and added points and points to the combined ratios for and  respectively 
however  gaap pension expense totaled million in and million in and thus had a lesser impact on gaap earnings comparisons 
the commercial lines statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the lesser adverse development in the provision for insured events in prior years  lesser loss frequency and lesser catastrophe losses 
the net million of adverse development in the provision for insured events in prior years was primarily in the following lines commercial multi peril million  commercial automobile million  and other commercial liability lines million  partially offset by favorable development in workers compensation million and homeowners million 
the adverse development reflects loss severity that was higher than expected and was primarily from accident years to  partially offset by favorable development in the accident year 
the million of adverse development in the provision for insured events in prior years was primarily in the following lines commercial automobile million  workers compensation million  commercial multi peril million and personal automobile million 
of the adverse development  million was attributable to the to accident years and the balance was attributable to earlier accident years 
harleysville group had publicly noted adverse loss trends in its workers compensation line for several quarters during and these trends are consistent with the experience of other companies writing this coverage  many of which have  during this time  made substantial additions to their reserves for insured events in prior years in this line of insurance 
the change in loss development patterns in was influenced by a number of factors 
a reorganization of harleysville group s claims operations resulted in more proactive claims management which  in turn  provided more contemporaneous loss estimates 
in addition  weak economic conditions have hampered the ability to return injured workers to employment thus extending the estimated length of disabilities and medical loss cost trends have increased 
the favorable development in workers compensation in reflects a moderation in severity 
the adverse development in commercial and personal automobile primarily was due to higher loss severity trends that became evident in the third and fourth quarters when case reserve increases were recognized 
the higher loss severity trends continued in for commercial automobile 
the case reserve increases for commercial automobile included the impact of adverse litigation trends 
harleysville group had previously publicly noted an increase in litigation on bodily injury cases and a slowing of the rate of settlement 
the combination of all of these factors resulted in the increased estimate of ultimate losses 
the adverse development in commercial multi peril primarily was due to higher loss severity trends that became evident in the third and fourth quarters when case reserve increases were recognized 
like commercial auto  the trend continued in as increased litigation and a slow rate of settlement resulted in the increased estimate of ultimate losses 
while harleysville group had not incurred material construction defect liability losses prior to  it increased its provision for insured events of prior years by an additional million for estimated losses on construction defect liability claims because of increased case activity in the third and fourth quarters of the personal lines statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  in addition to the aforementioned effects of favorable development  the remaining decrease primarily was due to lesser catastrophe losses which affected the homeowners line 
net catastrophe losses decreased million and losses ceded under the aggregate catastrophe reinsurance agreement with mutual decreased million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to less severe catastrophes in other expenses increased million for the year ended december  primarily due to the write off of capitalized costs for a software project that will not be utilized 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on net income and earnings per share is not currently expected to be materially different from the pro forma amounts disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which includes all share based payment transactions throu gh december  the long term incentive plan ltip has a component which awards shares based on the total shareholder return of the company s stock relative to the total shareholder return of a group of insurance company stocks 
under apb no

accordingly  the company currently expects  based on preliminary calculations  to record a cumulative effect benefit of approximately million  net of tax  in the first quarter of the impact that any future share based payment transactions will have on our financial position or results of operations is not yet known 
in september  the accounting standards executive committee acsec issued statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop 
sop provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
sop defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits  features  rights  or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement  or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contr act 
sop is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company does not expect the impact of adopting sop to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the ability to generate sufficient cash to meet cash obligations as they come due 
harleysville group s primary sources of cash are premium income  investment income and maturing investments 
cash outflows can be variable because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses  either individually or in the aggregate 
accordingly  harleysville group maintains investment and reinsurance programs generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without forced sales of investments 
harleysville group models its exposure to catastrophes and has the ability to pay claims without selling held to maturity securities even for events having a low less than probability 
even in years of greater catastrophe frequency  harleysville group has been able to pay claims without liquidating any investments 
harleysville group has also considered scenarios of declines in revenue and increases in loss payments  and has the ability to meet cash requirements under such scenarios without selling held to maturity securities 
harleysville group s policy with respect to fixed maturity investments is to purchase only those that are of investment grade quality

harleysville group participates in a securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturity securities from the investment portfolio are loaned to other institutions for a short period of time in return for a fee 
at december   harleysville group held cash collateral of million related to securities on loan with a market value of million

applying the current regulatory restrictions as of december   million would be available for distribution to the company by its subsidiaries in without prior regulatory approval 
see the business regulation section of this form k  which includes a reconciliation of net income and shareholders equity as determined under statutory accounting practices to net income and shareholders equity as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
also  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted risk based capital rbc standards that require insurance companies to calculate and report statutory capital and surplus needs based on a formula measuring underwriting  investment and other business risks inherent in an individual company s operations 
these rbc standards have not affected the operations of harleysville group since each of the company s insurance subsidiaries has statutory capital and surplus in excess of rbc requirements 
these rbc standards require the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
based upon their statutory financial statements  the ratio of total adjusted capital to the authorized control level for the company s nine insurance subsidiaries at december  ranged from to 
the following summarizes harleysville group s contractual obligations at december  total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations debt interest on debt gross liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses net liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses the table above does not include capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations or purchase obligations as they are either not applicable or not material 
the timing of the amounts for the gross and net liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses are an estimate based on historical experience and expectations of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts stated above 
property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss settlement expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  harleysville group attempts  in establishing rates  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
in the past  inflation has contributed to increased losses and loss settlement expenses 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks  as well as the other information contained in this report on form k 
if any of the following events described in the risk factors below actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
you should refer to the other information set forth in this report on form k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
risks related to the property and casualty insurance industry generally if our estimated liability for losses and loss settlement expenses is incorrect  our reserves may not be adequate to cover our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses and may have to be increased 
we are required to maintain loss reserves for our estimated liability for losses and loss settlement expenses associated with reported and unreported claims for each accounting period 
we regularly review our reserving techniques and our overall amount of reserves and  based on our estimated liability  raise or lower the levels of our reserves accordingly 
if our estimates are incorrect and our reserves are inadequate  we are obligated to increase our reserves 
an increase in reserves results in an increase in losses and a reduction in our net income for the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified 
accordingly  an increase in reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our reserve amounts are estimated based on what we expect our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses to be 
these estimates are based on facts and circumstances of which we are aware  predictions of future events  trends in claims severity and frequency and other subjective factors 
although we use a number of actuarial methods to project our ultimate liability  there is no method that can always exactly predict our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses 
in addition to reviewing our reserving techniques  as part of our reserving process we also consider information regarding each claim for losses  our loss history and the industry s loss history  legislative enactments  judicial decisions and legal developments regarding damages  changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including inflation 
if certain catastrophic events occur  they could have a significant impact on our financial and operational condition 
results of property insurers are subject to weather and other events prevailing in any given year 
while one year may be relatively free of major weather or other disasters  another year may have numerous such events causing results for that year to be materially worse than for other years 
our insurance subsidiaries have experienced  and are expected in the future to experience  catastrophe losses 
it is possible that a catastrophic event or a series of multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our insurance subsidiaries  thereby limiting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us 
in the last years  the largest non flood catastrophe to affect our results of operations was hurricane floyd in the third quarter of  which resulted in million of losses 
various events can cause catastrophes  including severe winter weather  hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  war  terrorism  explosions and fires 
the frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
our insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce the impact on our business of a catastrophe through geographic diversification and through the purchase of reinsurance covering various categories of catastrophes  which generally excludes terrorism 
nevertheless  reinsurance may prove inadequate if a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit  or an insurance subsidiary pays a number of smaller catastrophic loss claims that  individually  fall below the subsidiary s retention level 
we are heavily regulated in the states in which we operate and if we violate those regulations or if the regulations unreasonably restrict our ability to do business  or if they change significantly  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we transact business 
the purpose of supervision and regulation is to protect individual policyholders and not shareholders or other investors 
our business can be adversely affected by private passenger automobile insurance regulations and any other regulations affecting property and casualty insurance companies 
for example  laws and regulations can reduce or set rates at levels that we do not believe are adequate for the risks we insure 
other laws and regulations can limit our ability to cancel or refuse to renew policies and require us to offer coverage to all consumers 
changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretations  pertaining to insurance  including workers compensation  may also have an adverse effect on our business 
although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives  such as federal terrorism backstop legislation  from time to time  also can impact the insurance industry 
in addition  proposals intended to control the cost and availability of health care services have been debated in the us congress and state legislatures 
although we do not write health insurance  rules affecting health care services can affect other insurance that we write  including workers compensation and commercial and personal automobile and liability insurance 
we cannot determine whether or in what form health care reform legislation may be adopted by the us congress or any state legislature 
we also cannot determine the nature and effect  if any  that the adoption of health care legislation or regulations  or changing interpretations  at the federal or state level would have on us 
if demand for property and casualty insurance decreases  it could have an adverse impact on our business 
historically  the results of the property and casualty insurance industry have been subject to significant fluctuations over time due to competition and due to unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect returns on our investments  inflationary pressures that affect the size of losses  and legislative and regulatory changes and judicial decisions that affect insurers liabilities 
the demand for property and casualty insurance  particularly commercial lines  also can vary with the overall level of economic activity 
in addition to the cyclicality of the property and casualty industry  our surety business is affected adversely by economic downturns that make it difficult for the insureds whose obligations we guarantee to fulfill their obligations 
if we are unable to reduce our exposure to risks through reliable reinsurance or if the cost of reinsurance increases  our risk of loss  or the cost of controlling our risk of loss  will increase 
we transfer a portion of our exposure to selected risks to other insurance and reinsurance companies through reinsurance arrangements 
under our reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of our losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss 
furthermore  we face a credit risk when we obtain reinsurance because we are still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurer cannot meet the transferred obligations 
therefore  the inability of any of our reinsurers to meet its financial obligations could materially and adversely affect our operations 
many reinsurers experienced significant losses related to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma during while it is expected that reinsurers will increase rates for business in states impacted by these storms  they may also increase rates for business in other areas of the country  including the markets in which we write 
the threat of terrorism and military and other actions may result in decreases in our net income  revenue and assets under management and may adversely affect our investment portfolio 
the threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the united states  europe and elsewhere  as well as loss of life  property damage  additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
actual terrorist attacks could cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations of harleysville group  as well as a decrease in our stockholders equity  net income and or revenue 
the effects of changes related to harleysville group may result in a decrease in our stock price 
the terrorism risk insurance act of  which was extended in  requires that some coverage for terrorist loss be offered by primary property insurers and provides federal assistance for recovery of claims through in addition  some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism  ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures 
we cannot predict at this time whether and the extent to which industry sectors in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of potential decreased commercial and economic activity  or how any such decrease might impact the ability of companies within the affected industry sectors to pay interest or principal on their securities  or how the value of any underlying collateral might be affected 
we can offer no assurances that the threats of future terrorist like events in the united states and abroad or military actions by the united states will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain changes in the accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies could have a material adverse impact on our reported net income 
we are subject to the application of gaap and other accounting standards  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
as such  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the financial accounting standards board 
it is possible that future changes required to be adopted could change the current accounting treatment that we apply and such changes could result in material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition 
if our investments lose value  our revenues and earnings will be adversely affected 
like many other property and casualty insurance companies  we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenues and earnings 
any significant decline in our investment income as a result of falling interest rates  decreased dividend payment rates or general market conditions would have an adverse effect on our results 
any significant decline in the market value of our investments would reduce our shareholders equity and our policyholders surplus  which could impact our ability to write additional business 
if our financial strength ratings are reduced  we may be adversely impacted 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that they believe are relevant to policyholders 
ratings are not recommendations to buy  hold or sell our securities 
although other agencies cover the property and casualty industry  we believe our ability to write business is most influenced by our rating from a 
m 
best 
according to a 
m 
best  its ratings are designed to assess an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing policyholder obligations 
currently  our rating from a 
m 
best is a  the th of a 
m 
best s ratings 
a rating below a from a 
m 
best could materially adversely affect the business we write 
we believe that our financial strength rating from moody s which is a  the th of moody s ratings  although important  has less of an impact on our business 
an unfavorable change in our moody s financial strength rating  however  could make it more expensive for us to access capital markets 
we cannot be sure that we will maintain our current a 
m 
best or moody s ratings 
although standard poor s rates our debt securities at bbb negative the th of standard poor s ratings  standard poor s does not currently rate our financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations 
risks related to our company in particular we face significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies  agents and from self insurance  which may result in lower revenues 
we compete with local  regional and national insurance companies  including direct writers of insurance coverage 
many of these competitors are larger than we are and many have greater financial  technical and operating resources 
in addition  we face competition within each insurance agency that sells our insurance because we sell through independent agencies that represent more than one insurance company 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product  price and service 
if our competitors offer products with more coverage  or price their products more aggressively  our ability to grow or renew our business may be adversely impacted 
there are more than groups writing property and casualty insurance in the united states  and we are approximately th in size 
our most significant competitors vary significantly in our different lines of business and in the geographic markets in which we compete 
the internet also could emerge as a significant source of new competition  both from existing competitors using their brand name and resources to write business through this distribution channel and from new competitors 
we also face competition because of entities that self insure  primarily in the commercial insurance market 
from time to time  certain of our customers and potential customers may examine the benefits and risks of self insurance and other alternatives to traditional insurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in the property and casualty insurance industry 
these developments include the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act of  which could result in increased competition from new entrants to the insurance market  including banks and other financial service companies  programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage  and changing practices caused by the internet  which have led to greater competition in the insurance business and  in some cases  greater expectations for customer service 
new competition from these developments could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if adverse conditions in the eastern and midwestern united states exist  our business would be disproportionately impacted 
we write property and casualty insurance business in the eastern and midwestern united states 
consequently  unusually severe storms or other natural or man made disasters that destroy property in these states could adversely affect our operations 
our revenues and profitability also are subject to prevailing economic and regulatory conditions in the states in which we write insurance 
we may be exposed to risks of adverse developments that are greater than if we conducted business nationwide 
we depend on independent insurance agents  which exposes us to risks not applicable to companies with dedicated agents 
we market and sell our insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agencies 
these agencies are not obligated to sell our insurance products  and generally they also sell our competitors insurance products 
as a result  our business depends in part on the marketing and sales efforts of these agencies 
if we diversify and expand our business geographically  then we may need to expand our network of agencies to successfully market our products 
if these agencies fail to market our products successfully  our business may be adversely impacted 
also  independent agents may decide to sell their businesses to banks  other insurance agencies or other businesses 
changes in ownership of agencies  or expansion of agencies through acquisition  could adversely affect an agency s ability to control growth and profitability  thereby adversely affecting our business 
if our insurance subsidiaries are not able to pay adequate dividends to us  our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends would be affected 
our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we principally rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying corporate expenses and dividends to shareholders 
as described below  the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries  as well as other regulatory restrictions 
as a result  we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or to allow us to pay dividends 
generally  the maximum dividend that may be paid by an insurance subsidiary during any year without prior regulatory approval is limited to a stated percentage of that subsidiary s statutory surplus as of a certain date  or adjusted net income of the subsidiary for the preceding year 
our insurance subsidiaries paid million of dividends to us in  million in  and none in of the dividends paid in  million were declared by our insurance subsidiaries in applying the current regulatory restrictions as of december   million would be available for distribution to us without prior approval during we anticipate no objections to the payment of the dividends described in the preceding sentence 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if insurance regulators otherwise determine that payment of a dividend to an affiliate would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiary s policyholders or creditors  because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise  the regulators may block dividends to affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends or the making of loans by our subsidiaries to us 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund payments on these notes when due 
although we have paid cash dividends in the past  we may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
we have a history of paying dividends to our shareholders when sufficient cash is available 
however  future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements and other factors  including the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us  which ability is restricted in the manner previously discussed in this section 
also  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution 
if we lose our key personnel our business could be adversely affected 
the success of our business is dependent  to a large extent  on our ability to attract and retain key employees  in particular our senior officers  and key management  sales  information systems  underwriting  claims and corporate personnel 
competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense 
although we have change of control agreements with a number of key managers  in general  we do not have employment contracts or non compete arrangements with  or key person insurance covering  our employees  including our key employees 
applicable insurance laws and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company  and a large shareholder may have significant influence over potential change of control transactions  which could affect our share value 
under applicable insurance laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled  no person may acquire control of us unless that person has filed a statement containing specified information with the insurance commissioner of each state and obtains advance approval for such acquisition 
under applicable laws and regulations  any person acquiring  directly or indirectly by revocable proxy or otherwise  or more of the voting stock of any other person is presumed to have acquired control of such person  and a person who beneficially acquires or more of our common stock without obtaining advance approval of the insurance commissioner of each state would be in violation of applicable insurance laws and would be subject to injunctive action requiring disposition or seizure of the shares and prohibiting the voting of such shares  as well as other action determined by the i nsurance commissioner of each such state 
in addition  many state insurance laws require prior notification to the state insurance department of a change of control of a non domiciliary insurance company licensed to transact insurance in that state 
although these pre notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change of control  they authorize regulatory action including a possible revocation of our authority to do business in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration 
any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of us may require prior notification in the states that have pre acquisition notification laws 
as of december   the mutual company owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the mutual company s stock ownership and ability  by reason of such ownership  to elect our board of directors  provides it with significant influence over potential change of control transactions 
finally  our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock having such terms  including voting rights  as the board of directors shall fix and determine
