item selected financial data the selected data presented below under the captions income statement data and balance sheet and other data for  and as of the end of  each of the years in the five year periods ended december   are derived from the consolidated financial statements of guitar center  inc and subsidiaries  which financial statements have been audited by kpmg llp  independent registered public accounting firm 
the consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended december   and the report thereon  are included elsewhere in this annual report

for the year ended december   million shares of common stock were deemed to be potential common stock and are included in the calculation of earnings per share representing the weighted average shares issuable upon the conversion of the senior convertible notes for the period of june   the issuance date of the notes  to december   under the if converted method 
the diluted earnings per share for has been restated to conform to eitf  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
net sales per gross square foot is a measure of sales efficiency based on square footage 
this calculation is presented for guitar center retail stores only  excluding music arts center retail stores  and does not include new stores opened during the reporting period 
compares net sales for the comparable periods  excluding net sales attributable to stores not open for months as of the end of the latter reporting period 
all references in this annual report to comparable store sales results are based on this calculation methodology 
this calculation is presented for guitar center retail stores only  excluding music arts center retail stores 
for the purpose of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings represents income before provision for income taxes and fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  amortization of debt financing costs  and one third of lease expense  which management believes is representative of the interest component of lease expense 
represents net income before interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization expense 
the reconciliation from reported net income to ebitda is as follows ebitda net income as reported income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
we present ebitda because many investors view this information as a useful measure of a company s ability to generate cash flow and service debt or capital obligations  and some of our debt instruments have in the past and may in the future include covenants that use similar concepts 
ebitda should not  however  be considered as a substitute for measures determined under generally accepted accounting principles  such as net income and cash flow from operations 
further  the calculation of ebitda varies from company to company and thus the amount that we calculated using the methodology described above may not be comparable to the amount of ebitda reported by other companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general guitar center  inc is the leading united states retailer of guitars  amplifiers  percussion instruments  keyboards and pro audio and recording equipment 
as of december   our retail store subsidiary operated guitar center stores across the united states  with stores in primary markets  stores in secondary markets and one tertiary market store 
in addition  as of december   our music arts center division operated stores specializing in band instruments for sale and rental  serving thousands of teachers  band directors  college professors and students 
we are also the largest direct response retailer of musical instruments in the united states through our wholly owned subsidiary  musician s friend  inc  and its catalog and website  www 
musiciansfriend 
com 
in  we opened a total of guitar center stores  including primary market stores  secondary market stores and one tertiary market store 
we presently expect to open approximately to additional guitar center stores in  including eight to primary market stores  to secondary market stores and two tertiary market stores 
as we enter new markets  we expect that we will initially incur higher administrative and promotional costs per store than is currently experienced in established markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase as other music product retailers attempt to execute national growth strategies 
our business strategy will also emphasize opportunities to continue to grow each of our brands  including further acquisitions if attractive candidates can be located for reasonable prices 
from to  our net sales grew at an annual compound growth rate of  principally due to the comparable store sales growth of our retail stores averaging per year  the opening of new stores  and a per year increase in the direct response channel 
we believe such volume increases are the result of the continued success of the implementation of our business strategy  continued growth in the music products industry and increasing consumer awareness of the guitar center  musician s friend and music arts center brand names 
our retail stores achieved comparable store sales growth of   and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe this growth reflects the strength of our merchandise selection  effective advertising and promotion  and well trained and committed personnel 
executive summary consolidated net sales in increased to billion from billion in consolidated net income in increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in during  our guitar center stores generated comparable store sales growth and an increase of in total net sales compared to sales from new stores totaled million and represented of the overall increase in sales 
we opened new guitar center stores in musician s friend  our direct response unit  generated an increase in net sales of in compared to within the overall sales increase for direct response  our web based sales grew at a rate of in  reflecting an increased consumer preference in using the web to place orders 
our initial order fill rate improved to in from in initial order fill rate reflects the percentage of items ordered by our customers that we are able to supply in the initial shipment to that customer 
gross profit margins decreased by of net sales due primarily to increased online competition leading  in particular  to expanded free freight offers in we are also spending more on internet search engine advertising in order to drive more traffic to our site 
we completed our acquisition on april  of music arts center  inc  a maryland based musical instrument retailer with an emphasis on the beginning musician 
at the time of acquisition  music arts center  inc operated retail locations primarily located in the northeast  mid atlantic and southern regions of the united states 
the acquired business was combined with our former american music business into a new division of our retail store subsidiary that operates under the music arts center name 
financial results prior to april  for our music arts center business reflect only our former american music stores and do not include results from the acquired business 
however  comparable sales for the year are computed using the combined comparable sales of music arts center  inc  and american music stores 
primarily as a result of this acquisition  the net sales for the music arts center business increased from million in to million in comparable sales for the year decreased which is inclusive of a decrease of at the american music locations  offset by a increase in comparable sales at the music arts center locations 
comparable sales decreased at american music principally due to the reduction in low margin institutional sales which is not part of our ongoing music arts center strategy 
we saw gross margin expand to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in this margin expansion is principally due to improved product mix and better pricing under the music arts center business and elimination of the institutional sales 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
additionally  the policy described below regarding credits and other vendor allowances is unique to our industry and deserves the attention of a reader of our financial statements 
valuation of inventory we value our merchandise inventory at the lower of cost using the weighted average method or market 
rental inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the specific identification method and are depreciated on a straight line basis while out under a rental agreement for rent to own sales 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value 
applicable costs associated with bringing inventory through our guitar center retail distribution center are capitalized to inventory 
the amounts are expensed to cost of goods sold as the associated inventory is sold 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories considering future customer demand for our products  taking into account general economic conditions  growth prospects within the marketplace  competition  market acceptance of current and upcoming products  and management initiatives 
based on this evaluation  we have recorded impairment adjustments to inventory and to cost of goods sold for estimated decreases in net realizable value 
these judgments are made in the context of our customers shifting needs  product and technological trends  and changes in the demographic mix of our customers 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of these conditions and uncertainties in the future outlook of our industry or the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory valuation changes as of any given balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives that are not amortized are required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently when triggering events occur 
factors we consider important  which could trigger impairment  include  among other things significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in stock value for a sustained period 
for long lived assets other than goodwill and intangibles that are not amortized  the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts and consider current and future expected sales volumes and related operating costs and any anticipated increases or declines based on expected market conditions and local business environment factors 
if a potential impairment is identified  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
fair value will be determined based on appraisal values assessed by third parties  if deemed necessary  or a discounted future cash flows analysis 
for goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized  impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the related assets of the underlying reporting unit to which the goodwill relates 
our assessment regarding the existence of impairment factors is based on market conditions and the operational performance of our business 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
sales returns as part of our satisfaction guaranteed policy  we allow guitar center customers to return product generally within days after the date of purchase  and we allow musician s friend customers to return product within days 
music arts center customers have business days from the date of purchase to return product 
we regularly review and revise  when deemed necessary  our estimates of sales returns based upon historical trends 
while our estimates during the past few years have approximated actual results  actual returns may differ significantly from estimate  either favorably or unfavorably  if factors such as economic conditions or the competitive environment differ from our expectations 
credits and other vendor allowances we receive cooperative advertising allowances ie  an allowance from the manufacturer to subsidize qualifying advertising and similar promotional expenditures we make relating to the vendor s products  price protection credits ie  credits from vendors with respect to in stock inventory if the vendor subsequently lowers their wholesale price for such products and vendor rebates ie  credits or rebates provided by vendors based on the purchase of specified products and paid at a later date 
cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction to selling  general  and administrative expense when we incur the advertising expense eligible for the credit 
we recognized cooperative advertising allowances of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense 
price protection credits and vendor rebates are accounted for as a reduction of the cost of merchandise inventory and are recorded at the time the credit or rebate is earned 
the effect of price protection credits and vendor rebates is recognized in the income statement at the time the related inventory is sold as a reduction in cost of goods sold 
the reserve against rebates receivable is determined by specifically identifying uncollectible accounts through an aging review and an analysis of vendor relationships 
we received payments for vendor rebates of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we earned and recognized vendor rebates of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
none of these credits are recorded as revenue

comparable guitar center store sales for the full year increased 
comparable store sales are defined as sales for the comparable periods  excluding net sales attributable to stores not open for months as of the end of the reporting period 
we believe that comparable store sales are a more useful indicator of store performance than the change in total net sales  since comparable store sales exclude the effects of changes in the number of stores open 
the financial information of the music arts center division for the year ended december  includes the results of american music for the entire year and music arts center from the time of its acquisition on april  through december   while the results include only american music

comparable guitar center store sales for the full year increased

in july and july  holders may at their election require us to purchase all of the notes at of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest  including contingent interest 
operating lease commitments consist principally of real property leases for our corporate offices  retail store facilities and distribution centers 
these leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term 
we also have rented personal property through operating leases 
payments for these lease commitments are provided for by cash flows generated from operations 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our need for liquidity will arise primarily from the funding of capital expenditures  working capital requirements and payments on our indebtedness  as well as possible acquisitions 
we have historically financed our operations primarily through internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
please see item a 
risk factors for a discussion of factors which could reasonably likely result in a decrease in the amount of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
as of december   we had million in borrowings under our credit facility and had available borrowings of million net of million of outstanding letters of credit 
in february of  we amended our credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo retail finance 
the credit facility permits borrowings up to million which may be increased to million at our option  subject to borrowing base limitations 
the actual amount available is tied to our inventory and receivable base  and our obligations under the credit facility are secured by liens on our principal assets 
borrowing options are prime rate at december  plus applicable prime margin  or london interbank offered rate or libor twelve month rate at december  was  plus applicable libor margin 
the applicable prime and libor margins are based upon levels of excess availability and adjusted quarterly 
if excess availability is greater than million  the applicable prime margin is and applicable libor margin is

if excess availability is less than or equal to million  the applicable prime margin is and the applicable libor margin is 
an unused fee of is assessed on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the agreement underlying the credit facility includes significant restrictive negative covenants 
among other things  these covenants restrict or prohibit our ability to incur debt and issue specified equity instruments  incur liens on our assets  make any significant changes in our corporate structure or the nature of our business  dispose of assets  make guaranties  prepay debt  engage in a change in control transaction  pay dividends  make investments or acquisitions  engage in transactions with affiliates and incur capital expenditures  and also require that we satisfy a minimum availability test 
the minimum availability test requires that we maintain million of reserved availability under the agreement based on its borrowing base limitations 
the amount we disclose in our public reports from time to time as available to borrow under the agreement is already reduced by this required reserve and outstanding letters of credit  and thus represents a net amount available under the agreement 
the agreement also includes representations and warranties which must be true each time we borrow funds under the credit facility and affirmative covenants 
the full text of the contractual requirements imposed by this financing is set forth in the amended and restated loan and security agreement and related amendments which have been filed with the securities and exchange commission 
subject to limited cure periods  the lenders under our credit facility may demand repayment of these borrowings prior to stated maturity upon the occurrence of specified events  including if we breach the terms of the agreement  suffer a material adverse change  engage in a change in control transaction  suffer a significant adverse legal judgment  default on other significant obligations  or in the event of specified events of insolvency 
the credit agreement matures in december on june   we completed the issuance of million principal amount of senior convertible notes due the convertible notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  subject to the payment of contingent interest under certain circumstances commencing january   and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment under specified circumstances 
under the contingent conversion feature of the convertible notes  subject to certain exceptions  they are not convertible into common stock unless and until the trading price of the common stock reaches at least for a specified period in advance of each quarterly conversion period or designated corporate events occur 
as of december   the convertible notes were convertible for the current quarterly conversion period 
the convertible notes will also become convertible upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions and other events described in the indenture 
the final maturity of the convertible notes is july  although holders may require us to repurchase the notes at their election in july  july or upon the occurrence of a change in control  in each case for a purchase price equal to the original principal amount plus accrued interest 
the indenture governing the convertible notes does not limit our ability to incur indebtedness or otherwise substantively restrict the operation of our business to any significant degree

for the years ended december   and  million  million and million of amortization of deferred financing fees was included in interest expense 
capitalized deferred financing fees at december  and were million and million and related accumulated amortization was million and million  respectively 
during we entered into master operating lease agreements with general electric capital corporation and us bank to lease equipment and other property primarily to support the operations of the distribution center for our guitar center retail stores 
under these agreements  we leased a total of million in equipment and other property 
the agreements call for monthly payments of  for a term of months through september  the terms of our significant financing agreements  including those related to our credit facility  the convertible notes and the equipment lease facilities described above  are not dependent on any change in our credit rating 
we believe that the key company specific factors affecting our ability to maintain our existing debt and lease financing relationships and to access such capital in the future are our present and expected levels of profitability and cash flow from operations  our working capital and fixed asset collateral bases  our expected level of capital expenditures  and the level of our equity capital relative to the level of debt obligations 
in addition  as noted above  our existing agreements include significant restrictions on future financings  including among others  limits on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and whether or not such indebtedness may be secured by any of our assets 
as is the case with most multi unit retailers  substantially all of the real property used in our business is leased under operating lease agreements 
please see item properties  disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate making additional capital investments of million to million in connection with the expansion of our guitar center stores distribution center and we expect to incur increased rent expense for that facility starting during the third quarter of net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period last year 
the largest use of cash was an increase in inventories of million 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to the opening of new guitar center retail stores and carrying somewhat higher inventory levels at our existing stores 
cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period last year 
the investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of the purchase of music arts center  inc for approximately million  a new corporate office building for million  a corporate airplane for million  capital expenditures for store expansions and remodels of million compared to million in the prior period  and computer equipment purchases of million in the current period compared to million in the same period last year 
additionally  we received net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of million 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million used in the same period last year 
the cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of the borrowings under our credit facility of million and remaining from the net proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and other employee purchases of our common stock 
the increase in borrowings was required to support the music arts center  inc acquisition and the capital spending described above 
we believe that our current operating cash flow  working capital  cash on hand  borrowings available under our credit facility and other sources of liquidity we believe are available to us will be sufficient to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business over the next months  including capital expenditures and new store openings 
our known capital resource and liquidity requirements for are expected to be primarily provided by net cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our credit facility 
traditionally  we have experienced the largest use of cash from operating activities in the latter part of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter due to the build up of inventory to support the holiday season  resulting in additional borrowings under our line of credit 
we believe that our peak seasonal liquidity needs during during this period will exceed our projected net cash flow from operations and borrowings currently available under our existing credit facility 
we are in discussions with our lending syndicate regarding an increase in the amount of maximum borrowings permitted under our credit facility 
however  these discussions are preliminary in nature and there is no assurance that an increase in the borrowings under credit facility will be available to us 
depending upon market conditions  we may also elect or be required to raise additional capital in the form of common or preferred equity  debt or convertible securities for the purpose of providing additional capital to fund working capital needs or continued growth of our existing business  or to refinance existing obligations including the senior convertible debentures which may be called for redemption at our election commencing in july any such financing activity will be dependent upon many factors  including our liquidity needs  market conditions and prevailing market terms  and we cannot assure you that future external financing for us will be available on attractive terms or at all 
if we require but are unable to obtain additional liquidity on favorable terms  we may be required to curtail our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially adversely impacted 
we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by opening additional stores in new and existing markets 
each new primary market format guitar center store typically has required approximately to million for gross inventory 
historically  our cost of capital improvements for a primary market format guitar center store has been approximately million consisting of leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment 
we incur higher costs in some geographic areas  particularly the northeast  and when we build a larger flagship store 
we have developed secondary market guitar center stores to build in sites that we do not believe will support our primary market format units 
we have opened secondary market stores between late and december  our secondary market stores have typically required approximately million to million for gross inventory and approximately  in capital expenditures 
in late  we opened our first tertiary market format store to serve smaller population centers 
our tertiary market format stores have required approximately million for gross inventory and approximately  in capital expenditures 
we expect the future costs to build new guitar center stores to rise from these historical amounts as we have experienced significant increases in the cost of construction 
we are also anticipating additional capital and strategic requirements related to improving our fulfillment facilities  upgrading our technology and systems  including a data warehouse and new point of sale system and pursuing new opportunities in the e commerce activities of our retail and direct response divisions as well as related businesses 
we also continue to make significant investments in information technology across our businesses and to incur costs and make investments designed to expand the reach of our businesses on the internet 
the costs of these initiatives and other investments related to our businesses will continue to be significant 
throughout our history  we have primarily grown organically 
however  we also believe there may be attractive opportunities to expand by selectively acquiring existing music products retailers or other complimentary businesses  if attractive opportunities can be identified 
we believe that our growth at music arts center will in large part be driven through many small acquisitions 
while we cannot provide assurance that we will complete any further acquisition transactions  in the ordinary course of our business we investigate and engage in negotiations regarding such opportunities 
acquisitions will be financed with cash on hand  drawings under our existing credit facilities  expansion of our credit facilities  issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination  depending upon transaction size and market conditions  among other things 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and supersedes fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  this statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this statement 
we do not expect the provisions of the sfas to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values rather than pro forma footnote disclosure 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies in the first fiscal year beginning on or after january  sfas r requires measurement of the cost of share based payment transactions to employees at the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognition of expense over the requisite service or vesting period 
sfas r allows implementation using a modified version of prospective application  under which compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards and all new awards will be recognized on or after the date of adoption 
fas r also allows companies to implement by restating previously issued financial statements  basing the amounts on the expense previously calculated and reported in their pro forma footnote disclosures required under fas we will adopt fas r using the modified prospective method beginning january  the impact of adopting fas r on our consolidated results of operations is not expected to differ materially from the pro forma disclosures currently required by fas see employee stock based compensation 
in addition  fas r requires classification of the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options in cash flows from financing activities  rather than cash flows from operating activities 
in  cash flows from operating activities included a cash inflow of million related to tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the proposed interpretation would apply to all open tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 including those acquired in business combinations 
in october  the fasb decided to postpone issuance of the final interpretation until fiscal year the company will evaluate the impact of any change in accounting standard on the company s financial position and results of operations when the final interpretation is issued 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination 
the eitf reached a consensus that the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or acquired subsequent to lease inception should be based on the lesser of the useful life of the leasehold improvements or the period of the lease including all renewal periods that are reasonably assured of exercise at the time of the acquisition 
this consensus is consistent with the company s policy regarding leasehold improvements 
the adoption of eitf issue did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during the construction period  which requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense 
these rental costs shall be included in income from continuing operations 
the effective date of this fsp guidance is the first reporting period beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for financial statements or interim financial statements that have not yet been issued 
the adoption of fsp will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies terminology within sfas and requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business follows a seasonal pattern  peaking during the holiday selling season in november and december 
sales in the fourth quarter are typically significantly higher on a per store basis and through the direct response unit than in any other quarter 
in addition  band rental season for our music arts center business starts in august and carries through mid october  but that seasonality does not have a significant impact on our consolidated results 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
however  in we anticipate that rising steel  lumber  concrete  labor  fuel and freight costs may increase expenses related to opening  remodeling  operating and relocating our stores  expanding our distribution center and operating our business

statements regarding the dates new facilities and systems will become operational are dependent upon third parties and events beyond our control  such as the availability of third party consulting resources  construction delays  technology development delays and other events 
sales and earnings trends are also affected by many other factors including  among others  world and national political events  general economic conditions  the effectiveness of our promotion and merchandising strategies  changes in the music products industry  retail sales trends and the emergence of new or growing specialty retailers of music products

as of december   the fair value of our senior convertible notes was million  based on quoted market prices 
at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
to the extent prevailing short term interest rates fluctuate  the interest expense we incur on our credit facility will change with a resulting effect positive or negative on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
historically  we have not carried significant cash balances and any cash in excess of our daily operating needs has been used to reduce our borrowings 
excess cash is generally invested in short term  high quality interest bearing investments
