the fluctuation in each respective year was primarily the result of the extent of employee gains recognized on stock option exercises 
our results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that stock options are exercised by employees and  consequently  the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed

amortization of acquired intangible assets percent percent change change in thousands  except percentages amortization of acquired intangible assets as a percentage of net revenues from time to time we have purchased  and we expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion increase the features  functions  and formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in online e commerce 
these purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods 
the increase in amortization of acquired intangibles during compared to prior years is due to the business acquisitions consummated during and intangible assets include purchased customer lists and user base  trademarks and trade names  developed technologies  and other intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets  excluding goodwill  over the period of estimated benefit  using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
our annual impairment test was carried out as of august  and we determined that there was no impairment 
there were no events or circumstances from that date through december  that would impact this assessment 
we expect amortization of acquired intangible assets to increase in as a result of the intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
amortization of acquired intangible assets may increase should we make additional acquisitions in the future

impact of foreign currency translation during  our international net revenues  based upon the country in which the seller  payment recipient  advertiser or other service provider is located  accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues  as compared to of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
net revenues and related expenses generated from international locations are denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries  and include euros  british pounds  korean won  canadian dollars  taiwanese dollars  australian dollars  chinese renminbi  and indian rupee 
the results of operations and certain of our inter company balances associated with our international locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased consolidated net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
during  the us dollar weakened against most of the foreign currencies listed above 
using the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from  our net revenues for would have been lower than reported using the actual exchange rates for by approximately million 
in addition  if 
table of contents the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from were applied to our cost of revenues and operating expenses for  these costs of revenues and operating expenses would have been lower in total than reported using the actual exchange rates for by approximately million 
the majority of this impact relates to the relative strength of the euro against the us dollar 
we expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance as we develop and deploy our global marketplaces and global payments platform 
as a result  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our consolidated net revenues and net income in the event the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies 
see the information in item a under foreign currency risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedging activities 
foreign exchange hedging policy we are a rapidly growing company  with an increasing proportion of our operations outside the united states 
accordingly  our foreign currency exposures have increased substantially and are expected to continue to grow 
the objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow  and results of operations 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  economic and translation transaction exposure around the world  we have certain assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 
economic exposure we also have anticipated and unrecognized future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
our primary economic exposures include future royalty receivables  customer collections  and vendor payments 
changes in the relevant entity s functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows 
we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the transaction is settled 
earnings translation exposure as our international operations grow  fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations 
such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded in interest and other income  net 
employee stock options we continue to believe that employee stock options represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program

revised  share based payment fas r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions  as we do currently  using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the new statement and may deem an alternative model to be more appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that would result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan  and the presentation of these tax benefits within the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods are the prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r  while the retroactive method requires companies to record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first disclosed period restated 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the effective date of fas r 
the effective date of the new standard under these new rules for our consolidated financial statements is january  adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes  as is our current practice see note the company and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of fas r 
we expect the compensation charges under fas r to reduce earnings per diluted share by approximately to per share for the year ending december  compensation expense calculated under fas r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes and may differ from our expectations based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits  and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of fas r  we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan

non cash charges to earnings included depreciation and amortization on our long term assets  provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues and the provision for transaction losses resulting from increased total payment volumes processed by our paypal subsidiary 
in and  operating cash flows were also positively impacted by the net cash amounts provided by year over year changes in working capital assets and liabilities

the net cash flows provided by financing activities in  and were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million in  million in  and million in our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of our stock price  the number of options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels 
the negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during was due to the weakening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
the positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during and was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies  primarily the euro 

table of contents we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  our business could suffer 
commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands other operating purchase payments due by year ending december  leases obligations total thereafter operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
other purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  computer equipment  software applications  engineering development services and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business 
for those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements  we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations 
these estimates have been developed based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
in conjunction with our skype acquisition  in addition to the initial consideration that has already been paid to former skype shareholders  we have certain earn out payments that are contingent upon skype achieving certain net revenue  gross profit margin based targets and active user targets

table of contents indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations  including our standard marketing  promotions and application programming interface license agreements 
under these contracts  we generally indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to domain names  trademarks  logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement 
in a limited number of agreements  including agreements under which we have developed technology for certain commercial parties  we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims  substantially all of which are indemnities related to our copyrights  trademarks  and patents 
to date  no significant costs have been incurred  either individually or collectively  in connection with our indemnification provisions 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 
provisions for doubtful accounts and authorized credits our us marketplaces and international marketplaces segments are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience  are monitored monthly  and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense  while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
the following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for   and in thousands  except percentages 
years ended december  net revenues from the us and international segments doubtful accounts and authorized credits provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a of net revenues from the us and international segments historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 

table of contents based on our results for the year ended december   a basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points expense related to doubtful accounts and revenue reduction related to authorized credits income from operations net income diluted earnings per share provision for transaction losses our payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse  as well as non performance of sellers who accept payment through paypal 
we establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions  such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services  automated clearing house  or ach  returns  buyer protection program claims and debit card overdrafts 
these allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts  necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date  including those of which we have not yet been notified 
the allowances  which involve the use of actuarial techniques  are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors 
the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar cases  historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 
the provision for transaction losses is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income 
at december   the allowance for transaction losses totaled million and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of total payment volume from paypal operations for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages 
years ended december  total payment volume transaction loss expense as a of total payment volume the establishment of appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
based on our results for the year ended december   a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  
table of contents  and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points transaction loss expense income from operations net income diluted earnings per share legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies litigation and other legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three segments 
accounting for income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of  the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we have a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income 
where the change in the valuation allowance relates to the tax deduction for employee stock option exercises  the change is reflected in additional paid in capital 
beginning in  any remaining deferred tax asset related to stock option deductions will be recognized in the periods when the benefit is received and  as such  a valuation allowance will not be required 
our us businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully fund their operating requirements  and we expect that profits earned outside the us will be fully utilized to fund our continued international expansion 
accordingly  we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
in the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely  we would be subject to us income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effective tax rates for   and in thousands  except percentages years ended december  provision for income taxes as a of income before income taxes historically  these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points provision for income taxes income from operations net income diluted earnings per share advertising and other non transaction revenues a portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other non transaction services in our us marketplaces  international marketplaces and payments segments 
net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements 
other non transaction net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to ebay users and from offline services provided by wholly owned subsidiaries that were divested in the second half of advertising and other non transaction net revenues  including barter transactions  totaled  and of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  and were primarily generated by our us marketplaces segment 
revenue from barter arrangements totaled million in  million in and million in certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate revenue recognition  including  but not limited to  the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements  the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition and  for barter transactions  the existence of comparable cash transactions to establish fair values 
our advertising and other non transaction net revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general 
unlike our transaction revenues  advertising and other non transaction net revenues are derived from a relatively concentrated customer base 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 

table of contents at december  our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled million 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of our reportable units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of august  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any of our reportable units was required 
we have determined that no events or circumstances from that date through december  indicate that a further assessment was necessary 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of three months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately million 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity instruments and equity method investments we hold  typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments 
we did not record an impairment charge during either of the years ended december  or relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of equity investments 
at december   the total carrying value of our equity instruments and equity method investments was million 
foreign currency risk international net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign operations use the local currency  which is primarily the euro  and to a lesser extent  the british pound  as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other 
table of contents factors 
in addition  at december   we held balances in cash  cash equivalents and investments outside the us totaling approximately billion 
during  the us dollar weakened against most of the foreign currencies listed above 
using the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from  our net revenues for would have been lower than reported using the actual exchange rates for by approximately million  of which million and million relate to our international marketplaces and payments segments  respectively 
in addition  if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from were applied to our cost of revenues and operating expenses for  these costs of revenues and operating expenses would have been lower in total than reported using the actual exchange rates for by approximately million 
the majority of this impact relates to the relative strength of the euro against the us dollar 
transaction exposure as of december   we had outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately million with maturity dates within days 
the hedge contracts are used to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our consolidated statement of income 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended december   was a net translation loss of approximately million 
this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
we consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation fas 
such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
from time to time  we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using both foreign currency options and forward contracts 
all contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed 
during the year ended december   the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant 
economic exposure we currently charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by ebay and paypal 
these charges are denominated in euros and these forecasted inter company transactions represent a foreign currency cash flow exposure 
to reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these forecasted inter company transactions  we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts during the year ended december  the objective of the forward contracts is to ensure that the us dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  we expect the hedge of certain of these forecasted transactions using the forward contracts to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
accordingly  we record as a component of other comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to the forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment 
we record all unrealized gains and losses in interest and accumulated other income  net  related to the forward contracts that do not receive hedge accounting 
table of contents treatment pursuant to fas during the year ended december  and  the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant 
the notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the losses  net of gains  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  was million and million  respectively 
the notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the loss  net of gains  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  was million and  respectively
