item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements on page and item a  risk factors commencing on page for a discussion of uncertainties  risks and other factors associated with these statements 
the company except where otherwise indicated  the terms moody s and the company refer to moody s corporation and its subsidiaries 
moody s is a provider of i credit ratings  research and analysis covering fixed income securities  other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets  and credit training services and ii quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks  corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets 
moody s operates in two reportable segments moody s investors service and moody s kmv 
moody s investors service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets  including various corporate and governmental obligations  structured finance securities and commercial paper programs 
it also publishes investor oriented credit research  including in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies  special comments and credit opinion handbooks 
the moody s kmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks  corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets 
the company operated as part of the dun bradstreet corporation old d b until september  the distribution date  when old d b separated into two publicly traded companies moody s corporation and the new d b corporation new d b 
at that time  old d b distributed to its shareholders shares of new d b stock 
new d b comprised the business of old d b s dun bradstreet operating company the d b business 
the remaining business of old d b consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the moody s business and was renamed moody s corporation 
the method by which old d b distributed to its shareholders its shares of new d b stock is hereinafter referred to as the distribution 
critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill and intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  moody s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer 
these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
in such cases  the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 
the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors  including the fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers 
the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years 
at december  and  deferred revenue included approximately million and million  respectively  related to such deferred monitoring fees 
additionally  in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront 
these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring period is years 
at december  and  deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately million and million  respectively 
moody s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december  and  accounts receivable included approximately million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its reviews  moody s establishes or adjusts allowances  as considered appropriate 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above noted factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts  could result in allowances that are greater or less than moody s estimates 
in each of and  the company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this management s discussion and analysis  is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may  in the future  adjust the provisions made in respect thereof 
since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material  and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved  their resolution could have a material adverse effect on moody s future reported results and financial position 
in addition  potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 
for the years ended december  and  the provision for income taxes reflected credits of million and charges of million due to changes in the company s reserves  respectively  for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody s in connection with its separation from old d b in october these tax matters are discussed under legacy tax matters below 
goodwill and other intangible assets moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
moody s also reviewed the mkmv trade secret for impairment which was reclassified as a finite lived asset beginning in december the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and the mkmv trade secret requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates 
in estimating future operating results and cash flows  moody s considers internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company s judgments  or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made  an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and the mkmv trade secret  which charge could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets  liabilities and obligations that moody s reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets  based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments future healthcare cost trends  based on historical market data  near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve 
the cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 
moody s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise which are amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
total unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans as of december  were million and the company expects to recognize approximately million of such losses in the company s net periodic pension expense 
differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense 
the company recognizes these differences over five years 
as of december   the company has unrecognized plan asset gains of million and the recognition of such gains is not expected to have a material impact on future net periodic pension expense 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income dollars in millions 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of assets  liabilities  obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
assumption used for estimated impact on operating income decrease increase discount rate weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets discount rates of and are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected operating income 
based on current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately million in compared with million excluding a million settlement loss in the expected expense increase in reflects the effects of lower discount rates  normal growth in plan liabilities  the amendment to the company s healthcare plan to increase moody s share of future costs  higher compensation for the supplemental executive benefit plan participants  as well as amortization of actuarial losses 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted  on a prospective basis  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

therefore  employee stock options granted on and after january  are being expensed by the company over the current four year option vesting period or sooner if employees are at or near retirement eligibility  based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is calculated based on a black scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company  which is limited 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in dollars in millions assumption used amount of increase in assumption estimated impact on operating income in decrease increase expected dividend yield grants grants grants expected share price volatility and grants grants expected option holding period and grants years year grants years other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated dividend distributions from non us subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact moody s 
operating segments moody s investors service consists of four rating groups structured finance  corporate finance  financial institutions and sovereign risk  and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets  and research  which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research  principally produced by the rating groups 
given the dominance of moody s investors service to moody s overall results  the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses  nor are such expenses allocated between the company s business segments 
accordingly  all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the moody s kmv segment 
the moody s kmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks  corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets 
in february  moody s board of directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the company s common stock outstanding  subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the company s authorized common shares from million shares to billion shares 
at the company s annual meeting on april   moody s stockholders approved the charter amendment 
as a result  stockholders of record as of the close of business on may  received one additional share of common stock for each share of the company s common stock held on that date the stock split 
such additional shares were distributed on may  all prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the stock split 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation

outlook moody s outlook for is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors  including interest rates  corporate profitability and business investment spending  merger and acquisition activity  consumer spending  residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity  securitization levels and capital markets issuance 
there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and  if actual conditions differ from these assumptions  moody s results for the year may differ from the current outlook 
for moody s overall  the company projects revenue growth in the high single digit to double digit percent range for the full year  including a small negative impact from foreign currency translation 
moody s expects the operating margin after the impact of expensing stock based compensation to decline by up to basis points in compared with this reflects investments the company is continuing to make to expand internationally  improve analytical processes  pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives  introduce new products and improve technology infrastructure 
for  moody s projects year over year growth in gaap diluted earnings per share in the high single digit to double digit percent range 
this expected growth includes the impact of reserve adjustments related to legacy tax matters in  and the expensing of stock based compensation in both and represents the final year of phasing for stock based compensation  which began in the impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of per diluted share in  compared to per diluted share in in the us  the company is forecasting mid single digit percent revenue growth for the moody s investors service ratings and research business unit for the full year in the us structured finance business  moody s expects revenue for the year to rise modestly from the record level of the company is projecting a high teens percent decline from to in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities  including home equity securitization  and notes a divergence in market views about the outlook for this business 
offsetting this expected decline  moody s looks for double digit year over year growth in asset backed securities  credit derivatives  and commercial mortgage backed securities 
in the us corporate finance business  the company believes that modest growth in investment grade issuance  gains in rated share of the syndicated bank loan market  and incremental revenue from the enhanced analysis initiative and new products will more than offset expected flat issuance in the speculative grade bond sector 
overall  moody s expects revenue in the us corporate finance business to grow in the low double digit percent range for the year 
in the us financial institutions sector  the company projects issuance by banks to increase slightly in compared with and issuance by insurers and other financial institutions to be flat or down 
however  fee increases partly related to the enhanced analysis initiative  as well as expected new ratings mandates  should produce revenue growth for the year in the low double digit percent range 
for the us public finance sector  moody s believes that rising interest rates will slow refinancing activity and result in lower issuance in than the company forecasts revenue for declining in the mid single digit percent range from the prior year 
moody s forecasts strong growth in the us research business unit at about twenty percent 
outside the us  the company expects ratings revenue to grow in the low teens percent range with high single digit to mid teens percent growth in all major business lines 
this forecast assumes that foreign currency translation rates will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth for the year 
in addition  the outlook assumes low and mid teens percentage growth in corporate revenue in europe and asia  respectively 
for the financial institutions business moody s expects to see high single digit revenue growth in europe  after a year of very strong issuance in  and low double digit percent growth in asia 
the company looks for low teens percentage growth in international structured finance and about twenty percent growth in international research revenue 
for moody s kmv globally  the company expects moderate growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products  credit decision processing software  and professional services 
this should result in mid to high single digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability 
contingencies from time to time  moody s is involved in legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation that are incidental to the company s business  including claims based on ratings assigned by moody s 
moody s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business 
management periodically assesses the company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available 
moody s discloses material pending legal proceedings  other than routine litigation incidental to moody s business  material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities  and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate 
for those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate 
in other instances  because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss  management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
based on its review of the latest information available  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  subject to the contingencies described below 
legacy contingencies moody s has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the distribution 
these contingencies are referred to by moody s as legacy contingencies 
information resources  inc an antitrust lawsuit was filed in by information resources  inc iri 
a detailed description of this lawsuit was contained in reports previously filed by the company with the sec 
as previously disclosed  vnu nv  a publicly traded dutch company  and its nv subsidiaries  vnu  inc  acnielsen corporation  ac nielsen us  inc  and nielsen media research  inc nmr collectively  the vnu parties  had assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit under the terms of the july  amended indemnity and joint defense agreement 
as a result of the indemnity obligation  moody s did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the vnu parties defaulted on their obligations 
however  in the event of such a default  contractual commitments undertaken by moody s in connection with various corporate reorganizations since would have required the company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the vnu parties 
on february   the parties to this action signed a settlement agreement  pursuant to which the action will be dismissed with prejudice and releases from liability will be exchanged among the parties 
such releases will also include the company  although not a defendant in the litigation  as a releasee 
any amounts payable to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement will be paid by the vnu parties  and the company will not be required to contribute any amounts to the settlement payment 
the dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the releases are being held in escrow pending such approval 
legacy tax matters old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
pursuant to a series of agreements  as between themselves  ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay one half  and new d b and moody s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half  of any payments for taxes  penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable internal revenue service irs rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements excluding the matter described below as amortization expense deductions for which new d b and moody s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities  also as described in such agreements  after new d b and or moody s pays the first million  which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as utilization of capital losses 
in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have  between themselves  agreed to each be financially responsible for of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  three specific tax matters are discussed below 
royalty expense deductions during the second quarter of  new d b received an examination report from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in in this examination report  the irs stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its tax returns for the years through the royalty report 
in the first quarter of  new d b received a similar examination report the second royalty report relating to the first quarter of during the second quarter of  new d b also received an examination report that had been issued by the irs to the partnership  stating the irs intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in in connection with the above transaction  and to reallocate to old d b income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for the reallocation report 
new d b also received a similar examination report the second reallocation report issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of in june  new d b and the irs conducted a mediation of these issues  at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the royalty report for and  the reallocation report  and certain tax refund claims made by old d b related to and the irs reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by old d b related to and may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in the settlement was withdrawn by the irs in november as a result of these events  the company increased its reserves for this matter by million in in  new d b  moody s  ims health and nmr executed a closing agreement with the irs reflecting terms originally agreed to in june after executing the closing agreement  ims health and nmr disagreed with new d b s calculation of each party s share of the tax liability set forth in the agreement 
as a result  new d b and moody s each increased its share of the assessment by million to million and moody s paid approximately million of this amount in october of these events resulted in a net reduction of tax expense of million 
new d b anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to collect the incremental amounts new d b and moody s were obligated to pay to the irs on their behalf 
based upon the current understanding of the positions which new d b and ims health may take  the company believes it is likely that new d b should prevail  but moody s cannot predict with certainty the outcome 
in addition  the second royalty report and the second reallocation report  which were not part of the closing agreement with the irs  have not been resolved 
moody s estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the irs for this matter is million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
in the fourth quarter of  new d b filed a protest with the irs appeals office concerning the irs denial of certain tax refunds owing old d b for and moody s estimates that its remaining share of the potential liability for the royalty expense deductions matter could be up to million after payment pursuant to the closing agreement  which takes into consideration the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the federal closing agreement and the potential write off of receivables for which the company s exposure could be up to million as discussed above 
amortization expense deductions in april  new d b received examination reports the april examination reports from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction 
this transaction was entered into in and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old d b since these deductions could continue through in the april examination reports  the irs stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by old d b on its and tax returns 
new d b disagrees with the position taken by the irs and can either accept and pay the irs assessment  challenge the assessment in us tax court  or challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims  where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge 
irs audits of old d b s or new d b s tax returns for years subsequent to have resulted in the issuance of similar examination reports for the through tax years  described below  in which case new d b has the aforementioned three courses of action 
similar examination reports could result for tax years subsequent to should any such payments be made by new d b related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years  including years subsequent to the separation of moody s from new d b  then pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  moody s would have to pay to new d b its share 
in addition  should new d b discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns  moody s would be required to repay to new d b an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits 
new d b had paid the discounted value of of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody s at the distribution date 
moody s estimates that the company s current potential exposure could be up to million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
this exposure could increase by approximately million to million per year  depending on actions that the irs may take and on whether new d b continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns 
in the april examination reports  the irs also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its and tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction 
in addition  the irs stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to old d b certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for and new d b disagrees with the positions taken by the irs and can take any of the three courses of action described in the first paragraph of this amortization expense deductions section 
irs audits of old d b s or new d b s tax returns for years subsequent to have resulted in the issuance of similar examination reports for the through tax years described below 
similar examination reports could result for years subsequent to should any such payments be made by new d b related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years  then pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  moody s would have to pay to new d b its share of new d b s payments to the irs for the period from through the distribution date 
moody s estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the irs for the potential disallowance of royalty expense deductions could be up to million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
moody s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability 
new d b had filed protests with the irs appeals office regarding the april examination reports 
in september  the irs appeals office remanded the case to the irs examination office for further development of the issues 
new d b has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office 
on may   new d b received a notice of proposed adjustment notice from the irs for the tax years which disallows amortization expense deductions allocated from the partnership to old d b on its and tax returns and to new d b on its  and tax returns and disallows certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its and tax returns and by new d b on its  and tax returns 
on august   new d b received an examination report the august examination report from the irs disallowing certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its and tax returns and by new d b on its  and tax returns consistent with the notice and in addition assessing a twenty percent penalty 
new d b has filed a protest with the irs appeals office regarding the august examination report 
currently  the company does not expect that the notice or the examination report will have a material impact on the legacy tax reserves and the potential future outlays related to legacy tax matters that are discussed below in summary of moody s exposure to three legacy tax matters 
moody s believes that the irs proposed assessments of tax against old d b and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old d b are inconsistent with each other 
accordingly  while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions  moody s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both 
utilization of capital losses in july  new d b and the irs reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by old d b during and in december  new d b executed a formal settlement agreement 
new d b received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of  and is awaiting receipt of the third and final assessment 
moody s paid its allocated share of the first two assessments consisting of cash payments of million million net of expected tax benefits and the utilization of a tax receivable of approximately million 
moody s remaining liability at december  was approximately million 
the amounts paid by moody s included its share of approximately million that moody s and new d b believe should have been paid by ims health and nmr  but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of new d b s calculation of their respective shares of the payments 
if new d b fails to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr  moody s understands that new d b anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against them 
moody s believes that new d b should prevail in its position  but the company cannot predict with certainty the outcome 
in the first quarter of  moody s had increased its reserves by million due to this disagreement 
summary of moody s exposure to three legacy tax matters the company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
in doing so  moody s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an million net reversal of reserves of which million related to an increase for the utilization of capital losses matter and million related to the reversal for the royalty expense deductions described above 
the company has recorded million of interest expense related to its legacy tax reserves 
moody s total net legacy tax reserves were million consisting of million of tax liabilities  partially offset by the expected utilization of million of tax receivables 
the million of expected cash payments consists of million of current liabilities reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the royalty expense deductions and utilization of capital losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months and million of non current liabilities 
it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the company  which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash flows 
although moody s does not believe it is likely that the company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the irs  potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as million and could increase with time as described above 
in matters where moody s believes the irs has taken inconsistent positions  moody s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments 
however  moody s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the irs would retain such duplicative payments 
dividends during  the company paid a quarterly dividend of in the first quarter and in each of the three subsequent quarters  per share of moody s common stock  resulting in dividends paid per share of during the year 
during and  the company paid quarterly dividends of and per share  respectively  of moody s common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of and  respectively
