business and industry overview ciber provides information technology it system integration consulting and other it services primarily to governmental agencies and fortune and middle market companies  across most major industries 
from offices located throughout the united states and europe  we provide our clients with a broad range of it services  including custom and package software development  maintenance  implementation and integration 
to a lesser extent  we also resell certain it hardware and software products 
our five operating segments  commercial solutions  federal government solutions  state local government solutions  package solutions and european operations  are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services  client base and geography 
our commercial solutions  federal government solutions and state local government solutions segments comprise our us based ciber branch offices that provide it services and products in custom developed software environments 
these offices are classified into a segment based on their primary client focus category commercial  federal or state local  however  they also may have clients that fall into another category 
for example  a commercial office may also provide services to a government client 
our india operations are considered part of our commercial solutions segment 
our package solutions segment is comprised of our ciber enterprise solutions division that primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including erp and supply chain management software from software vendors such as oracle  lawson and sap 
our european operations segment represents our offices in europe  eastern asia and australia that provide a broad range of it consulting services  including package software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services 
the majority of our services revenue is recognized under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue is primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our commercial  federal and state local government solutions segments typically around to as compared to our package solutions and european operations segments typically around to 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our overall average rate per hour is also influenced by the results of our fixed price engagements  which can vary 
our effective average hourly billing rates are highest in our package solutions segment approximately per hour as compared to our european operations segment approximately to per hour and to our commercial  federal and state local government solutions segments approximately to per hour 
success or overruns on fixed price contracts can also influence our effective average rate per hour 
in addition  our foreign revenue is also impacted by changes in currency exchange rates 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
gross profit percentage on other revenues is approximately 
this is a blend of low margin product sales typically to and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit percentage on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technology change and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
in addition  the recent economic downturn has negatively affected the operations of many of our clients and prospective clients and has negatively impacted their it spending 
as a result  competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong 
we have responded to these challenging business conditions by closely monitoring the utilization of our billable personnel  through continuing evaluation of the size of our workforce and required office space and by managing our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
business combinations in  we acquired two small entities  including a single office operation specializing in sap implementations and an india based professional services firm specializing in custom application development 
during and  we completed the following significant business combinations acquired company date consultants added goodwill added novasoft ag september million ascent technology group limited may million scb computer technology  inc march million ecsoft group  plc january million novasoft ag novasoft in late  we acquired approximately of the net outstanding shares of novasoft  headquartered in heidelberg  germany  for total consideration of approximately million in cash and million of ciber common stock 
in  we increased our ownership of novasoft to approximately for an additional million for consideration and expenses and we expect to acquire the remaining shares in the cash portion of the payment consideration was primarily funded by borrowing under our bank revolving line of credit 
novasoft is a provider of implementation and other consulting services related to sap software products 
novasoft is an sap alliance partner and implements all of sap s erp products  including mysap 
com products and industry specific applications 
at the time of the acquisition  novasoft had approximately consultants  located mainly in germany  the uk and spain 
we acquired novasoft to expand both our international presence and our capacity to deliver sap related services 
when combined with our existing european operations  we now provide sap related consulting services from european countries 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected novasoft to contribute approximately million in annualized revenue 
for  novasoft recognized revenue of approximately million 
ascent technology group limited ascent based in hinckley  uk  ascent provides it services to medium sized enterprises with a particular focus on software implementation and sales  including both sap and sage erp solutions and microsoft 
net software services 
ascent has also developed and sells its own proprietary customer relationship management software 
the aggregate purchase consideration for ascent included million in cash and million of ciber common stock 
in addition  ascent had certain debt obligations  totaling approximately million  which we repaid shortly after closing the acquisition 
we primarily used a portion of the cash raised from our convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and to repay ascent s debt 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected ascent to contribute approximately million in annualized revenue 
for  ascent recognized revenue of approximately million 
scb computer technology  inc scb based in memphis  tennessee  scb provided it services similar to ciber  including consulting  outsourcing and professional staffing  with a particular focus on federal and state government clients 
the aggregate purchase price included million in cash and million in ciber common stock 
in addition  scb had certain debt obligations  totaling approximately million that we repaid shortly after closing the acquisition 
we used a portion of the cash raised from our debentures to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and to repay scb s debt 
this acquisition expanded our federal government solutions and state local government solutions segments and added beneficial customer relationships to our commercial solutions business 
we acquired scb so that a combined ciber and scb would be able to compete more effectively for larger public sector contracts 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected scb to contribute approximately million in annualized revenue  however  scb s operations generally had lower average billing rates and slightly lower gross margins than our historical averages  which lower our measurements in these areas 
it is difficult to measure the incremental revenue recognized in from our acquisition of scb since many of the scb offices were combined with existing ciber offices 
however  each of the ciber reporting segments to which scb contributed  commercial solutions  state local government solutions  and federal government solutions  all realized organic revenue growth during our commercial solutions segment  which received approximately of scb s revenue  realized organic growth of approximately in our state local government solutions segment  which received approximately of scb s revenue  realized organic growth of approximately in finally  our federal government solutions segment  which received approximately of scb s revenue  realized organic growth of approximately in we believe the acquisition provided an opportunity to realize operational efficiencies in the form of lower combined selling  general and administrative costs  primarily by reducing scb s corporate administrative costs 
ecsoft group plc 
now named ciber europe limited is based in london 
at the time of the acquisition  ecsoft had operations in denmark  the netherlands  norway  sweden and the uk that provided it consulting services similar to services provided by ciber 
we acquired ecsoft to increase the size of our european operations and add depth to our european management team 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected ecsoft to add approximately million in annual revenue 
for  ciber europe limited recognized revenue from prior ecsoft operations totaling approximately million 
these revenue results include our denmark operation which incurred significant cost overruns on two fixed price projects that constrained revenue and operating income results in that operation by approximately million during see our european operations segment discussion under results of operations for additional discussion on these projects 
the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the closing date of the respective acquisition 
results of operations consolidated the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income interest and other expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following table sets forth certain operating data for our reportable segments year ended december  in thousands total revenue commercial solutions federal government solutions state local government solutions package solutions european operations inter segment total revenue income from operations commercial solutions federal government solutions state local government solutions package solutions european operations corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income net interest and other expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in the revenue growth primarily resulted from our acquisitions of scb  ascent and novasoft along with the acquisition of a small  single office sap practice  and was offset by the august sale of the staffing component of our ibm operation 
collectively  these acquisitions  offset by the divestiture of our ibm staffing operation  added approximately million in incremental revenue to as compared to excluding the revenue associated with the and acquisitions and divestiture from both periods  revenue would have increased by approximately compared to revenue in was positively impacted by organic revenue growth in all five of our reporting segments  ranging from approximately in our commercial segment to approximately in our package segment 
our average number of billable consultants working during the year increased to approximately  in from approximately  in other revenue increased to million in from million in due to our acquisition of ascent and sales of their proprietary software product 
the ascent increase was partially offset by an approximate million decrease in domestic hardware and software sales  due in part to a decrease in sales to a large state local solutions segment client 
our average billing rate increased to per hour in compared to per hour in higher billing rates in our european operations segment  now a larger percentage of the overall revenue total  plus higher billing rates in our commercial solutions segment  accounted for the majority of the increase 
consultant utilization was in as compared to in in total  our gross profit percentage decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in the overall decline represents a mix of higher margins on other revenue  which improved by basis points combined with a decline in services margins which fell by basis points 
the other revenue margin improvement is primarily due to a full year of high margin product sales from our ascent acquisition combined with improved margins within the technology solutions practice in our package solutions segment 
the basis point year over year services margin decline is attributed primarily to execution issues in our european operations and state local solutions segments 
in our european operations segment  cost overruns on two fixed price danish projects  along with poor performance in the first half of the year in one of our uk offices accounted for approximately basis points in overall services margin decline 
in our state local solutions segment  project cost overruns and a fourth quarter project cancellation and project delay negatively impacted overall services gross margins by approximately basis points 
positively impacting services gross margins in was the full year benefit of ascent and novasoft  which combined  incrementally contributed approximately million of services revenue 
this incremental revenue yielded a gross margin of approximately  positively impacting ciber s overall services gross margin by approximately basis points 
the balance of the services gross profit percentage decline  about basis points  was the result of higher labor costs in our commercial solutions and state local solutions segments  and investments in our onshore and offshore cibersites locations 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in  primarily due to our acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in from in the increase is due primarily to expected higher sg a costs in our european operations segment  now a larger percentage of our overall business due to our acquisitions of ascent and novasoft 
excluding europe  sg a as a percentage of revenue actually decreased by approximately basis points 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in due to additional amortizable intangible assets  primarily customer relationships  resulting from our recent acquisitions 
interest income and expense fluctuate based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed 
in addition to our outstanding debentures  our average line of credit balance was approximately million during as compared to million during interest income is primarily from cash held in our european subsidiaries 
net interest expense totaled approximately million in compared to million in the prior year 
other expense  net was  in as compared to other income  net of million in the amount was primarily comprised of a million gain on the sale of our ibm staffing operation during the third quarter and gains on foreign currency forward contracts of  offset by foreign currency losses of million and minority interest expense of  other income in included foreign currency gains of million   of gains on foreign currency forward contracts and minority interest income of  our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rates in both and were favorably impacted by a federal research credit 
the lower rate in was due to an adjustment to the expected benefit of the research and experimentation credit that ciber first recognized at the end of absent the adjustment to the expected benefit of this tax credit  ciber s effective tax rate for would have been approximately 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in the revenue growth primarily resulted from our acquisitions of scb  ascent and novasoft  plus the full year benefit of our acquisitions of ecsoft and alphanet 
our acquisitions added approximately million in incremental revenue to and the full year benefit of our acquisitions added another million in incremental revenue to excluding the incremental revenue contributed by the and acquisitions  revenues would have decreased by approximately from the prior year 
approximately one fourth of the decrease was due to a reduction in services from a large telecommunications client in september of  which negatively impacted revenue on a year over year basis by approximately million 
revenue in was positively impacted by organic revenue growth in our federal government solutions and european operations segments that was offset by decreased sales in our commercial solutions  state local government solutions and package solutions segments 
our average number of billable consultants working during the year increased to approximately  in from approximately  in other revenues increased to million in from million in due to our acquisition of ascent and sales of their proprietary software product 
the ascent increase was partially offset by decreased domestic hardware and software sales 
our average billing rate was per hour in compared to per hour in in total  our gross profit percentage decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease is due to lower gross margins on services revenue  partially offset by increased gross margins on other revenue 
the decline in gross profit on services revenue was primarily due to expected lower margins on the incremental revenue contributed by scb  as well as lower profitability on three projects that experienced cost overruns 
our gross profit percentage on other revenue increased to in from in due to increased sales of higher margin proprietary software products contributed by ascent 
in addition  consultant utilization in was compared to utilization of in sg a increased to million in from million in  due to the incremental costs associated with our acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in from in  as we continued efforts to contain costs and leverage our existing overhead infrastructure 
contributing to this was a combined million decrease in office rent and sg a depreciation expense in amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in due to additional amortizable intangible assets  primarily customer relationships  resulting from our recent acquisitions 
interest income and expense fluctuates based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed 
interest expense increased to million in from million in primarily due to the december sale of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures 
interest income is primarily from cash held in our european subsidiaries 
other income  net was million in as compared to  in other income in included foreign currency transaction gains of million   of gains on foreign currency forward contracts and minority interest income of  our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rate in was favorably impacted by a federal research credit while was largely impacted by tax benefits resulting from the closure of certain subsidiary operations 
our acquisition of novasoft in late has also slightly increased our effective tax rates  as novasoft operates in foreign countries with higher tax rates

the sale negatively affected services revenue by approximately million in compared to incremental revenue contributed by our acquisitions totaled approximately million 
absent the acquisition and divestiture activity  organic growth was approximately during and was achieved mainly because of our continued shift away from it staffing and toward more project based work 
commercial revenue was negatively impacted in and because of a large telecommunications client that significantly reduced the use of our services in september of this client reduction negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in and by million in other revenue for our commercial segment represents the resale of third party hardware and software products 
in  the substantial decrease in other revenue as compared to was the result of continued downward pricing pressure on hardware and software  resulting from increased competition from the direct sales channels of hardware and software manufacturers 
gross profit percentage on services revenue decreased by basis points to in as compared to in due to higher employee wage and benefit costs combined with an increased reliance on higher cost subcontractors 
gross profit percentage on services revenue improved by basis points in to compared to in due to our continued shift away from it staffing toward higher margin project based work 
our gross profit percentage on other revenue increased by basis points in compared to  which was due to the mix of products sold and our focus on the sale of higher margin products 
in  we experienced a basis point decline in our gross profit percentage on other revenue as compared to  which was due to the pricing pressures and increased competition mentioned above 
the commercial segment s operating income percentage declined to in from in due to the previously discussed gross profit decline combined with higher sg a costs 
the higher sg a costs are primarily due to the investment we are making in cibersites  our low cost application development and support centers

our acquisition of scb in march of contributed to both the and revenue increases  adding incremental revenue of approximately million in and approximately million in excluding the impact of the scb acquisition  federal revenue grew organically by approximately in and in compared to the prior years 
the organic revenue increase is primarily due to increased spending  particularly in the areas of defense and homeland security within existing government agency clients  as well as the successful penetration of new agency accounts resulting in new contract wins 
in  while revenue grew organically for the year compared to  during revenue declined by approximately in the last half of the year compared to the first half 
the decrease is due primarily to the loss of revenue from an outsourcing contract where ciber was a subcontractor to a larger prime vendor 
the term of the outsourcing contract ended  and it was required by the federal agency for which the work was being performed that the contract be re bid 
ciber and the prime vendor with whom we partnered were unsuccessful in our effort to continue providing services under the contract 
loss of this contract resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately million in the second half of in addition  the federal segment recognized approximately million less revenue in the last six months of compared to the first six months on a telecommunications outsourcing arrangement where we provide maintenance services on a time and materials basis 
this contract remains in place  and the maintenance services associated with it will continue to fluctuate up and down based on demand 
revenue for the remaining federal operations grew by approximately in the last six months of compared to the first six months 
federal gross profit percentage decreased by basis points in compared to and by basis points in compared to federal gross profit percentages were in  in and in revenue and gross profit contributed by our march acquisition of scb accounted for the entire decline 
the average gross profit percentage associated with the revenue contributed by scb for ten months of and a full year in was approximately 
this compares to gross profit margins associated with non scb federal segment revenue of approximately over that same two year period 
the majority of the federal revenue contributed by scb consists of long term contracts with low bill rates and low gross margins 
although gross margins are low on these contracts  the sg a overhead structure is also low 
as a result  in  operating income as a percentage of revenue declined by only basis points compared to a basis point decline in gross margin 
in  operating income declined by basis points to from in  which is a combination of the lower scb gross margins throughout the year combined with lower operating margins in the last six months resulting from the decline in revenue previously discussed

the organic growth in services revenue was attributed to growth in our security practice  as well as our ability to leverage our expertise in certain state local verticals 
the decrease in organic total revenue was due primarily to it budget constraints in the state and local government marketplace resulting from overall state and local budget deficits 
the consulting services gross profit percentage in our state local segment decreased in to from in several factors were responsible first  the company put a heavy dependence on high priced subcontractors  particularly for the work associated with the hurricane katrina relief efforts in new orleans  second  we experienced lower average billing rates and lower utilization elsewhere in the segment  and third  we experienced a project cost overrun and a fourth quarter project cancellation and delay that negatively impacted our service growth profit percentage by approximately basis points 
operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by basis points in as compared to the lower gross profit percentage on services revenue in  explained above  partially offset by lower sg a costs as a percentage of revenue  accounted for the operating income percentage decrease 
sg a as a percentage of revenue was relatively flat between and  and thus the improvement in operating income percentage over was due entirely to improvement in the overall gross profit percentage

the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in peoplesoft related services offset in part by an increase in oracle related services 
the market for peoplesoft implementation services was hindered in due to the uncertainty around oracle corporation s bid to acquire peoplesoft 
firms that had purchased peoplesoft software licenses were reluctant to engage firms like ciber to implement that software until there was clarity around the outcome of oracle s takeover attempt 
in addition to organic growth in the package segment  revenues also benefited from our first quarter acquisition of a single office operation specializing in sap implementations 
this acquisition closed at the beginning of january and contributed revenue of approximately million in other revenue is derived from our technology solutions practice and represents commissions on the resale of third party it hardware products 
in  other revenue increased by approximately to million compared to million in heavy fourth quarter demand for it hardware sold to customers for their enterprise package software implementations along with successful cross selling efforts accounted for much of the increase 
gross profit as a percentage of services revenue in the package solutions segment declined by basis points in to compared to in higher labor costs accounted for the majority of the services gross profit percentage decline 
the basis point decrease in in gross profit percentage on services revenue was due to constrained demand because of the oracle takeover attempt of peoplesoft previously mentioned  which caused billing rates to compress slightly 
in addition  cost overruns on a peoplesoft project in the first half of also negatively impacted gross profit margins on services revenue 
gross profit on other revenue  which consists of commission dollars earned on the resale of certain hardware products  increased by basis points in over related to higher commission rates on higher revenue volumes 
overall  gross profit percentage  after suffering a basis point decline in related to the peoplesoft takeover and surrounding uncertainty  improved by basis points in the improvement was constrained by the higher labor costs mentioned above 
the revenue increase  which caused sg a expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue to in from in  combined with improved gross profit on other revenue  had a positive impact on operating income margins

ecsoft now named ciber europe limited contributed revenue of approximately million in  million in  and million in the ecsoft revenue results include our denmark operation which incurred significant losses on two fixed price projects that constrained revenue and operating income results in that operation by approximately million 
the two denmark fixed price projects are for a public sector client and are still ongoing 
the cost overruns are the result of poor price estimating during the bidding phase  an initial poor technical design on one of the projects  resulting in a re write of the application  poor project management and resource allocation and an inefficient change control process resulting in an expansion of the project scope without any incremental increase to the fixed price 
we currently anticipate that both of these projects will be complete early in the second quarter of ascent and novasoft contributed approximately million and million in  respectively  and million and million in  respectively 
excluding acquisition related revenue  organic increases in european segment revenue were in and in the organic revenue increase includes the impact of favorable changes in foreign currency rates vs 
the us dollar  which we estimate contributed approximately million 
in  however  the us dollar was relatively neutral for the year against the foreign currencies that impact our european operations  though the us dollar did strengthen in the last six months of excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes  our european operations had organic revenue growth of approximately in and in the organic growth rate is somewhat distorted by the large percentage of overall revenue contributed by acquisitions in and other revenue in and represents ascent s sales of proprietary and third party software products 
gross profit percentage on services decreased basis points in and basis points in approximately basis points of the decrease were due to a project overrun in our denmark operation 
in  continued project cost overruns on the two fixed price projects in our denmark operation mentioned above  along with poor performance in the first half of the year in one of our uk offices negatively impacted services gross profit by approximately basis points 
positively impacting european services gross profit in was the full year benefit of ascent and novasoft which combined  added approximately million of incremental services revenue yielding gross margins of approximately  positively impacting services gross profit percentage by approximately basis points 
the remainder of the fluctuation in services gross margin  approximately basis points  is due to an approximate basis point improvement in gross margins in our netherlands operation 
the remainder of the fluctuation in gross profit percentage for both and was due to a change in the mix of our business resulting from our various acquisitions during those years of companies that operated at more traditional industry levels 
the gross profit percentage on europe s other revenue decreased from in to in due to unusually high gross profit on ascent software sales in related to ascent s proprietary crm product  whereas the majority of other revenue in related to lower margin re selling activity of other non proprietary products 
europe s operating income percentage improved in compared to due to the acquisitions of ascent and novasoft  both higher operating margin businesses  and reductions in sg a payroll costs and office rent 
in  europe s operating income percentage decreased by approximately basis points to in compared to in the decrease in gross profit  explained above  combined with expected higher sg a expenses from ascent and novasoft  accounted for the decrease 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of historically  we have used our operating cash flow  borrowings under our line of credit  periodic sales of our common stock  as well as the sale of debentures  to finance ongoing operations as well as business combinations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our operating cash flow and our available line of credit will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year

until we acquire ownership of novasoft  our use of novasoft s cash  outside of their business opportunities or needs  is limited under german corporations law 
total accounts receivable increased slightly to million at december   from million at december  total accounts receivable day s sales outstanding dso was days at december   as compared to days at december  changes in accounts receivable have a significant effect on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  client mix public vs 
private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control  and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
accrued compensation and related liabilities were million at december   and million at december  these balances are subject to the effects from the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle 
at both december  and  there were days of unpaid wages 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related contractors 
investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
we used only million of our cash for acquisitions in  as compared to million for acquisitions in spending on property and equipment increased to million in from million in  as we made investments in our cibersites locations  and purchased client project related assets 
in and  our financing activities were primarily comprised of cash used for the repayment of our line of credit and the purchase of treasury stock and cash provided by sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options 
in  we also used our cash to repay million of debt acquired in connection with our scb and ascent acquisitions 
we purchased million of treasury stock during  as compared to million in at december   we had authorization for the repurchase of an additional million of common stock or convertible debt under our current repurchase plan 
we may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock or our convertible debt  whichever is more advantageous 
the cash provided by sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and options exercised decreased to million in  as compared to million in in early  we increased our ownership in novasoft to  and we announced our intentions to attempt to acquire all of the remaining novasoft minority interest shares 
we anticipate the remaining costs to acquire all of the minority interest shares will be approximately million which  subject to government approval  we expect to complete in convertible senior subordinated debentures in a private placement on december   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures due to mature in december the debentures are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments  prior to the close of business on the final maturity date only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after december   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business days after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of debentures for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the debentures  if the debentures have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
on january   ciber made an irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares  not less than of the principal amount of the debentures surrendered for conversion 
on july   we increased our irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares of the principal amount of the debentures surrendered for conversion 
as a result  upon conversion we will deliver cash in lieu of our common stock 
debenture holders may require us to repurchase their debentures on december    and  or at any time prior to their maturity in the case of certain events  at a repurchase price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
from december   to  but not including december   we may redeem any of the debentures if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period 
beginning december   we may  by providing at least days notice to the holders  redeem any of the debentures at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
bank line of credit we have a million revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na that expires on september  as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
the line of credit will remain unsecured  unless borrowings exceed million for two consecutive fiscal quarters or if certain financial covenant thresholds are exceeded  in which case  substantially all of ciber s assets would secure the line of credit 
the interest rate charged on borrowings under the agreement ranges from the prime rate of interest prime less to prime less  depending on ciber s pricing ratio and changes  as required  on the first day of each quarter 
ciber s pricing ratio is defined as the ratio of ciber s senior funded indebtedness at the end of each quarter divided by ciber s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters then ended 
on december   the bank s prime rate was and our rate for borrowing was 
we are also required to pay a fee per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit 
this fee ranges from to  depending on ciber s pricing ratio and changes  as required  on the first day of each quarter 
the terms of the credit agreement contain  among other provisions  specific limitations on additional indebtedness  liens and merger activity and prohibit the payment of any dividends 
the line of credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants including a maximum asset coverage ratio senior funded indebtedness  excluding amounts due to ibm credit under the wholesale financing agreement  divided by net accounts receivable  excluding foreign accounts and accounts securing our wholesale finance agreement with ibm credit of  a maximum leverage ratio a ratio of total funded indebtedness divided by ebitda of to  a maximum senior leverage ratio the ratio of senior funded indebtedness divided by ebitda of to  and a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio the ratio of ebitdar to total fixed charges of to we are required to satisfy the financial covenants at the end of each quarter 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  certain elements of these ratios are defined below 
senior funded indebtedness includes borrowings under our line of credit and our term loan with wells fargo plus the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any liabilities under our wholesale financing agreement with ibm credit 
it does not include our debentures or any liabilities under any swap contract 
total funded indebtedness includes all senior funded indebtedness plus all subordinated indebtedness 
this includes our debentures  but does not include any liabilities under any swap contract 
ebitda represents net income from continuing operations plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense  measured over the prior four quarters 
ebitdar represents net income plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense and rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
total fixed charges represents the sum of capital expenditures  plus interest expense and rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total our debentures of million are due  and we presently pay approximately million annually in interest related to the debentures 
however  pursuant to their terms  they may be redeemed for cash at various times prior to maturity beginning in since we cannot predict any such redemption of the debentures  their full value is reflected in this table based upon their scheduled maturity date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 
we believe the future interest obligation on our line of credit is not estimable  primarily because the balance is not predictable and because the interest rate is a variable rate determined quarterly 
assuming neither the balance nor the rate changes in  we would pay less than million for interest expense in related to the line of credit 
includes operating leases for all office locations and office equipment 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
our consulting revenue and profitability are affected by the number of workdays in a quarter 
typically  our billable hours are reduced in the second half of the year  especially during the fourth quarter  due to the large number of holidays and vacation time taken by our billable consultants 
as a result  our operating income as a percentage of revenue is generally the lowest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year

 statement of cash flows 
the company will adopt sfas r effective january   at which time  the company must calculate and record in the income statement the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options  awarded to employees for services received 
the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the instruments  and is required to be recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
under the modified prospective transition method that we expect to apply upon adoption  compensation cost will be recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of sfas r  as well as for the unvested portion of the awards outstanding as of the effective date 
the implementation of the provisions of sfas r will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share 
we estimate that the adoption of sfas r will reduce our net income by approximately million to million  however  actual results may vary depending on our future stock price  number of options issued and any future changes to our employee stock option programs 
in the fourth quarter of  ciber s board of directors authorized the company to accelerate the vesting of certain outstanding stock options in order to minimize the future expense anticipated upon adoption of sfas r 
during and  the company accelerated the vesting on the majority of its outstanding stock options and  in total  decreased ciber s future option expense by approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue earned but not yet billed  costs to complete fixed price projects  collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill  valuation of other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves  amounts related to income taxes and others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as services are performed or products are delivered in accordance with contractual agreements and us generally accepted accounting principles 
we primarily provide consulting services under time and materials or fixed price contracts 
we estimate that approximately of our service revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we estimate and accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
when billed in the following month  we compare the actual bills to our accruals  and any differences are adjusted to revenue at this time 
differences are commonly the result of adjustments made as time sheets are approved  late time sheets are received and rates are changed 
for fixed price contracts for system design  development and implementation  which we estimate represent approximately of our total revenue  we recognize revenue based on the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
each contract has different terms  scope  deliverables and engagement complexities that require significant judgment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and cost is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements and other costs  as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve a certain level of performance  can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our engagements 
in addition  with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of cost overruns 
losses  if any  on fixed price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined 
collectibility of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million  and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectibility each month 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large credit worthy fortune companies and governments 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
evaluation of goodwill impairment at december   we had million of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated 
the estimation of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income in our statement of operations 
valuation of other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill  if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions and estimates 
we often use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
at december   we had million of other intangible assets 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life 
accrued compensation and other liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience  and actual amounts may vary 
in addition  with respect to our potential exposure to losses from litigation  claims and other assessments  we record a liability when such amounts are believed to be probable and can be estimated 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we subsequently determine that we will realize more or less of our net deferred tax assets in the future  such adjustment would be recorded as an increase or reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  changes in the geographic mix of our business  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
we also establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not fully succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts  such as the progress of a tax audit  new case law  or expiration of a statute of limitations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
during  approximately of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made from our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
in december  we entered into a one year cross currency swap arrangement to partially hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain euro based foreign operations 
the notional amount of the swap is million million 
a change in the value of the us dollar against the euro would result in a million change in the value of our hedge instrument 
during the term of the cross currency swap  we will also remit to and receive from the counterparty interest payments equal to the three month euribor rate plus and the three month us libor rate  respectively 
at december   ciber pays interest at a rate of and receives interest at a rate of on the notional amount  and such rates are reset quarterly 
therefore  changes in the euribor and us libor rates will impact our net interest expense 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our bank line of credit has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our line of credit were million and our interest rate was
