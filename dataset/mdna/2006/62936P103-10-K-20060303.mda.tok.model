overview our objective is to build a profitable biopharmaceutical company by discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs and recombinant proteins 
our current product candidates are primarily for the treatment of bone and mineral disorders  gastrointestinal disorders and central nervous system disorders 
we have one us food and drug administration  or fda  approved product  one product candidate presently undergoing regulatory review for approval to market in the us and europe  as well as other product candidates in various stages of clinical development and preclinical development 
we are also promoting two fda approved products on behalf of two other pharmaceutical companies 
our fda approved product  cinacalcet hcl  has received marketing approval in the us  the european union and canada  for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis and for the treatment of elevated calcium levels in patients with parathyroid carcinoma 
we have licensed to amgen worldwide rights to cinacalcet hcl  with the exception of japan  china  north and south korea  hong kong and taiwan  where we have licensed such rights to kirin brewery  ltd  or kirin 
amgen developed and is marketing cinacalcet hcl in the us under the brand name sensipar and in europe under the brand name mimpara 
kirin is presently in phase iii clinical trials with cinacalcet hcl 
both amgen and kirin have contractually committed to pay us royalties on their sales of cinacalcet hcl 
preos is our most advanced product candidate 
preos is our brand name for recombinant  full length human parathyroid hormone which we are developing as a potential treatment for post menopausal osteoporosis 
in may  we filed a new drug application  or nda  with the fda seeking approval to market preos in the us the pdufa date for the preos nda is march  pdufa date refers to the date that the fda is expected to notify a drug sponsor about the approval status of an nda 
we have granted to nycomed danmark aps  or nycomed  the exclusive right to market and sell preos in europe 
nycomed also assumed responsibility to file all necessary regulatory filings to obtain marketing approval for preos in europe 
nycomed filed its european marketing authorization application  or maa  with the european medicines evaluation authority  or emea  in march the committee for medicinal products for human use of the emea  or the chmp  has adopted a positive opinion recommending authorization for nycomed to market preos in europe 
the chmp recommendation is generally the last step prior to receipt of marketing authorization of the emea 
if marketing approval from the emea is granted  nycomed intends to market preos in europe under the brand name preotact and expects to be ready to launch preotact in europe during the second half of we are conducting a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with teduglutide  our analog of glucagon like peptide  in patients with short bowel syndrome and have completed a proof of concept phase ii clinical trial in patients with crohn s disease 
our corporate licensee  glaxosmithkline  is engaged in phase i clinical development activities with a calcilytic compound licensed from us for the potential use in osteoporosis 
astrazeneca is engaged in phase i clinical development activities with a compound active at mglurs licensed from us 
janssen is also engaged in phase i clinical development activities with a compound licensed from us for potential use in central nervous system disorders 
we are also evaluating the potential use of a proprietary compound  isovaleramide  in a variety of central nervous system disorders 
in october  we entered into an agreement with allergan  inc to co promote allergan s proprietary drug  restasis  an ophthalmic product approved for the treatment of keratoconjuctivitis sicca  or dry eye 
in august  we entered into an agreement with amgen to promote amgen s proprietary drug  kineret  a biologic therapy approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis 
we have agreed with amgen that we will end our promotion of kineret effective march  we believe our activities under these agreements have allowed us to develop and train our sales organization in preparation for the commercial launch of preos if and when approved by the fda 
we have incurred cumulative losses from inception through december  of approximately million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue our current and anticipated development projects 
commercial manufacturing activities for preos  the build up of the infrastructure necessary for the commercial launch of preos and the conduct of pre and post fda approval clinical trials with preos will substantially contribute to our operating losses 
other activities that will increase our operating losses include the conduct of clinical trials with teduglutide  clinical manufacturing for teduglutide  and  contractual commitments to fund research activities in our metabotropic glutamate receptor program 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects involve preos and teduglutide 
we also have other significant research and development efforts  including isovaleramide and our work with astrazeneca on metabotropic glutamate receptors 
preos 
preos is our brand name for recombinant  full length  human parathyroid hormone that we are developing as a potential treatment for post menopausal osteoporosis 
during the years ended december   and we incurred million  million  and million  respectively  in the research and development of this product candidate  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of preos 
we have incurred costs of approximately million since we assumed development obligations for this product candidate under our acquisition of allelix biopharmaceuticals inc  or allelix  in december our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
the goal of our preos development program is to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international agencies 
we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
to obtain the first of such approvals  we submitted an nda to the fda in may the fda has accepted the nda for review 
the pdufa date for the preos nda is march  we have granted to nycomed the exclusive right to market and sell preos in europe 
nycomed also assumed responsibility to file all necessary regulatory filings to obtain marketing approval for preos in europe 
nycomed filed its maa with the emea in march the chmp has adopted a positive opinion recommending authorization for nycomed to market preos in europe 
the chmp recommendation is generally the last step prior to receipt of marketing authorization of the emea 
because of the ongoing work with respect to the preos program  the fda review process  the initiation of commercial manufacturing activities  the creation of a sales and marketing organization  and the risks associated with the drug approval process  including the risk that we may have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of clinical trials or conduct additional clinical trials not presently planned to secure marketing approvals and the additional risks identified herein  we are unable to estimate the costs to completion or the completion date for the preos program 
material cash inflows relating to our preos development program will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if preos finds acceptance in the marketplace 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the receipt of marketing approval from the applicable regulatory agencies and acceptance in the marketplace  and the availability of sufficient funds to complete development of the product  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our preos program will commence  if ever 
to date  we have not received any revenue from commercial sales of preos 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of preos on a timely basis  or at all  include the following we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of the drug or be unable to obtain such approval on a timely basis  we may be unable to secure adequate commercial supplies of preos in order to initiate commercial launch upon approval  and we may not have adequate funds to complete the development and prepare for the commercial launch of preos 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for preos  secure adequate commercial supplies of preos  or secure adequate funds to complete development and prepare for commercial launch would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity we would not earn any sales revenue from preos  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all  and our profitability would be delayed 
teduglutide 
teduglutide is an analog of glucagon like peptide  a naturally occurring hormone that regulates proliferation of the cells lining the small intestine 
we are independently investigating teduglutide as a potential treatment for short bowel syndrome and crohn s disease 
we initiated a pivotal phase iii study in adults with short bowel syndrome in the first quarter of a phase iia proof of concept clinical study to evaluate the possible utility of teduglutide in the treatment of patients with crohn s disease has been completed and based upon the results of the study  we plan to advance the clinical development of teduglutide for crohn s disease 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  in the research and development of this product candidate  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of teduglutide 
we have incurred costs of approximately million since we assumed development obligations of this product candidate under our acquisition of allelix in december our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
the goal of our teduglutide development program is to obtain marketing approval from the fda  and analogous international agencies 
we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
before we can obtain such marketing approvals we will need to complete pivotal clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit an nda to the fda 
we are unable to estimate the costs to completion or the completion date for the teduglutide program because of the ongoing work with respect to the pivotal phase iii trial in adults with short bowel syndrome  the early stage of the clinical trials in crohn s disease  the risks associated with the clinical trial process  including the risk that patient enrollment in the clinical trials may be slow  that we may repeat  revise or expand the scope of future trials or conduct additional clinical trials not presently planned to secure marketing approvals  and the additional risks identified herein 
we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our teduglutide program will commence  if ever  because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinicals trials  receipt of marketing approval from the applicable regulatory agency  acceptance in the marketplace  and the availability of sufficient funds to complete development of the product 
to date  we have not received any revenues from product sales of teduglutide 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of teduglutide on schedule  or at all  include the following we may be unable to enroll on a timely basis or at all  a sufficient number of patients to complete our clinical trials as planned  teduglutide may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in the pivotal and on going clinical trials  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of the drug on a timely basis  or at all  our ability to continue to be able to secure adequate clinical and commercial supplies of teduglutide in order to complete preclinical studies  clinical trials and initiate commercial launch upon approval  and we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of teduglutide 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for teduglutide or to timely complete development and obtain regulatory approval would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity we would not earn any sales revenue from teduglutide  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all  and our profitability would be delayed 
other research and development programs most of the remaining research and development expenses for the three years ended december   were generated by various early clinical stage programs  pre clinical studies and drug discovery programs  including those described below 
metabotropic glutamate receptor program 
since  we have been working to find compounds that act on targets in the central nervous system called metabotropic glutamate receptors  or mglurs 
we have discovered a number of compounds that activate or inhibit mglurs and that are highly selective for specific subtypes of mglurs 
our animal studies with a number of these compounds have demonstrated their potential as drug candidates for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as chronic pain 
additionally  animal studies with a number of these compounds have demonstrated their potential as drug candidates for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd 
in march  we entered into an agreement with astrazeneca under which we collaborate exclusively in an extensive program around a number of mglur subtypes 
we granted astrazeneca exclusive rights to commercialize mglur subtype selective compounds 
under our agreement  we are required to co direct the research and pay for an equal share of the preclinical research costs  including capital and a minimum number of personnel  through march unless earlier terminated by astrazeneca or us upon six months advance written notice 
if certain milestones are met  astrazeneca is required to pay us up to million 
astrazeneca is also required to pay us royalties on sales of products that include those compounds 
we have the right to co promote any resulting product in the united states and canada and to receive co promotion revenue  if any 
should we elect to co promote products  in some circumstances we will be required to share in the development and regulatory costs associated with those products  and we may not receive some late stage milestone payments 
astrazeneca is engaged in phase i clinical development activities with a compound active at mglur s licensed from us 
during the three years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  in research and development expenses under our collaboration with astrazeneca 
our development  administration and overhead costs are included in total research and development expenses for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
isovaleramide for cns disorders 
isovaleramide is a small organic molecule which we are evaluating as a potential treatment for various central nervous system disorders 
preclinical studies have shown that isovaleramide is effective in a number of animal models of epilepsy and spasticity 
we have completed several phase i clinical trials with isovaleramide to evaluate its safety and tolerability 
our analysis of the data indicates that the drug was safe and well tolerated 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively in research and development of this product candidate  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical supplies of isovaleramide 
our development  administration and overhead costs are included in total research and development expenses for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
calcilytic compounds 
we are pursuing a treatment for osteoporosis that focuses on the discovery and development of orally administered drugs called calcilytic compounds 
calcilytic compounds are small molecule antagonists of the calcium receptors that temporarily increase the secretion of the body s own parathyroid hormone  which may result in the formulation of new bone 
in animal studies  we determined that intermittent increases in circulating levels of parathyroid hormone can be obtained through use of calcilytics 
in  we collaborated with glaxosmithkline for the research  development and commercialization of calcium receptor active compounds from the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone metabolism disorders 
we are not expending significant resources in the program 
in december  glaxosmithkline initiated a proof of principle phase i clinical trial with a calcilytic compound for which we received a million milestone payment 
in november  glaxosmithkline initiated new phase i clinical studies with more advance compounds for which we received an additional million milestone payment 
we will receive additional payments of up to an aggregate of million if certain clinical milestones are achieved  and royalties on sales of any commercialized products based on compounds identified in the collaboration 
glycine reuptake inhibitors 
we collaborated with janssen on glycine reuptake inhibitors to identify prospective drug candidates for schizophrenia and dementia 
janssen has now assumed full responsibility for the development of product candidates identified under the collaboration 
we are not expending any significant resources in the program 
in november  we received a milestone payment from janssen as a result of the selection of a preclinical compound for further development as a potential treatment for schizophrenia 
janssen has informed us that they have moved a compound from this collaboration into a phase i clinical trial 
we will receive additional milestone payments of up to million from janssen  if certain milestones are met  and royalties on sales of any drugs developed or sold by janssen under this collaboration agreement 
summary of other programs 
the goal of our other programs is to discover  synthesize  develop and obtain marketing approval for product candidates 
material cash inflows will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
currently all of these compounds are in pre clinical stages or early clinical stages 
in order to obtain marketing approval  we will need to initiate and complete all current and planned clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
because of this  and the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from these programs will commence  if ever

we could receive future milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate if each of our current licensees accomplishes the specified research and or development milestones provided in the respective agreements 
in addition  all of the agreements require the licensees to make royalty payments to us if they sell products covered by the terms of our license agreements 
however  we do not control the subject matter  timing or resources applied by our licensees to their development programs 
thus  potential receipt of milestone and royalty payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control 
some of the late stage development milestone payments from astrazeneca will not be due if we elect a co promotion option under which we may commercialize products 
further  each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee either for any reason or under certain conditions 
we have entered into certain research and license agreements that require us to make research support payments to academic or research institutions when the research is performed 
additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the institutions or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses 
as of december   we have a total commitment of up to million for future research support and milestone payments 
further  depending on the commercial success of certain of our products  we may be required to pay license fees or royalties 
for example  we are required to make royalty payments to certain licensors on teduglutide net sales and cinacalcet hcl royalty revenues 
we expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
under our agreement with astrazeneca  we are required to co direct the research and pay for an equal share of the preclinical research costs  including capital and a minimum number of personnel through march unless earlier terminated by astrazeneca or us upon six months advance written notice 
additionally  we have entered into long term agreements with certain manufacturers  contract research organizations  and suppliers that require us to make contractual payment to these organizations 
we expect to enter into additional collaborative research  contract research  manufacturing  and supplier agreements in the future  which may require up front payments and long term commitments of cash

in september  we completed construction of leasehold improvements on approximately  square feet of laboratory  support and administrative space in the mars discovery district in downtown toronto  ontario 
leasehold improvement costs were approximately million 
in january  we completed the construction of a  square foot building consisting of administrative offices and scientific laboratories in research park of the university of utah in salt lake city  utah 
construction costs were approximately million 
in december  we completed a sale leaseback on this facility which resulted in net proceeds of million 
we expect that our existing capital resources including interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations through the next months 
however  our actual needs will depend on numerous factors  including the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development and commercialization activities  our ability to comply with the terms of our research funding agreements  our ability to maintain existing collaborations  our decision to seek additional collaborators  the success of our collaborators in developing and marketing products under their respective collaborations with us  our success in producing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our clinical trials and commercial launch  the costs we incur in obtaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights or gaining the freedom to operate under the patents of others  and our success in acquiring and integrating complementary products  technologies or businesses 
our clinical trials may be modified or terminated for several reasons including the risk that our product candidates will demonstrate safety concerns  the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates for further development or may require additional or expanded clinical trials to be performed  and the risk that our manufacturers may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of our drug candidates to support our clinical trials or commercial launch  which could lead to a disruption or cessation of the clinical trials or commercial activities 
if any of the events that pose these risks comes to fruition  we may have to substantially modify or terminate current and planned clinical trials  our business may be materially harmed  our stock price may be adversely affected  and our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired 
we may need to raise substantial additional funds to support our long term research  product development  and commercialization programs 
we regularly consider various fund raising alternatives  including  for example  partnering of existing programs  monetizing of potential revenue streams  debt or equity financing and merger and acquisition alternatives 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  collaborations  or license agreements and other financing mechanisms 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or to obtain funds through arrangements with licensees or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue and research and development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  accrual of research an development expenses  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we earn our revenue from research and development support payments  license fees  milestone payments and royalty payments 
as described below  significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
 to all of our revenue transactions and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to all revenue transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we recognize revenue from our research and development support agreements as related research and development costs are incurred and the services are performed 
the terms and conditions of our research and development support agreements are such that revenues are earned as the related costs are incurred 
the principal costs under these agreements are for personnel employed to conduct research and development under these agreements 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved and where the amount of the milestone payment approximates the value of achieving the milestone 
we recognize revenue from up front nonrefundable license fees on a straight line basis over the period we have continuing involvement in the research and development project 
royalties from licensees are based on third party sales of licensed products and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms when third party results are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
cash received in advance of the performance of the related research and development support and for nonrefundable license fees when we have continuing involvement is recorded as deferred income 
where questions arise about contract interpretation  contract performance  or possible breach  we continue to recognize revenue unless we determine that such circumstances are material and or that payment is not probable 
we analyze our arrangements entered into after june  to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
allocation of revenue to individual elements which qualify for separate accounting is based on the estimated fair value of the respective elements 
accrual of research and development expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
our balance sheet reflects net long lived assets of million  including net goodwill of million as of december  when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
as of december   we have not determined the existence of any indication of impairment sufficient to require us to adjust our historical measure of value of such assets 
in  we ceased amortizing goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
we have not determined the existence of any indication of impairment sufficient to require us to adjust our historical measure of the value of such assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r which is a revision to sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principals board opinion no 
 or apb no 
 and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in april  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
 delaying the required implementation of sfas no 
r 
under sab no 
 sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning with our first quarter of as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the apb no 
intrinsic value method and  therefore we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations  although it is not expected to have any impact on our overall consolidated financial position 
the precise impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time as it will depend in part on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had sfas no 
r been adopted in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
 which is presented in the pro forma financial results described in note g to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under the current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
sfas no 
r allows companies to choose one of three transition methods the modified prospective transition method without restatement  modified prospective transition method with restatement  or modified retroactive transition method 
we have chosen to use the modified prospective transition methodology without restatement 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
 which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  which requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively to all prior period financial statements presented  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle  and also provides that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk exposure results from our investment portfolio  our convertible notes  our secured notes and our lease obligation 
our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
the securities we hold in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
after a review of our marketable investment securities  we believe that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in highly liquid  investment grade securities and money market funds of various issues  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component in stockholders equity deficit 
our percent convertible notes in the principal amount of million due june   our percent secured notes in the principal amount of million and our million lease obligation each have a fixed interest rate 
the fair value of the convertible notes is affected by changes in the interest rates and by changes in the price of our common stock 
the fair value of the secured notes is affected by changes in the interest rates and by historical rates of royalty revenues from cinacalcet hcl sales 
the fair value of the lease obligation is affected by changes in the interest rates and by changes in the value of real estate and lease rates in salt lake city  utah 
foreign currency risk 
we have research and development operations in canada 
additionally  we have significant clinical and commercial manufacturing agreements which are denominated in euro dollars 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar or euro dollar  or by weak economic conditions in canada or europe 
when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar or euro dollar  the cost of expenses in canada or europe decreases 
when the us dollar weakens against the canadian dollar or euro dollar  the cost of expenses in canada or europe increases 
the monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary which are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and certain accrued liabilities 
a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar or euro dollar from the december  rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary to change by an insignificant amount 
we are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
