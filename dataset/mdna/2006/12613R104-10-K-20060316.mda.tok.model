we operate industry leading websites  each with its own distinct brand  in four content categories technology  games and entertainment  business and community

with the sale of the us print publication in  advertising revenues from the remaining print business will be reported as marketing services revenue and subscription revenues will be reported as licensing  fees and users 
we evaluate our revenues according to the classifications listed above 
we classify our marketing services revenues and licensing  fees and user revenues as interactive revenues and our publishing revenues as publishing revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
revenues for the past three years for these categories are as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues marketing services licensing  fees and users interactive publishing as a percentage of revenues marketing services licensing  fees and users interactive publishing we had an average of million unique users per month in the fourth quarter of  compared to million unique users in the fourth quarter of  an increase of 
these users generated over million web page views per day during the fourth quarter compared to million in  a increase 
these increases reflect growth primarily from our games and entertainment and webshots properties 
while increases or decreases in unique users and daily average page views are not necessarily indicative of 
table of contents increases or decreases in financial results  we believe that these statistics are helpful because they provide insight into the growth of the internet as an advertising medium resulting from increased user adoption and into user demand for cnet networks properties in particular 
operating expenses included in our operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment consist of cost of revenues  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs  which are primarily cash related expense activities 
the majority of our cash related expenses are costs associated with employee compensation  benefits and facilities  which represented over of our total operating expenses in noncash related expenses consist of depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment and are included in our operating income 
cost of revenues includes costs associated with the production and delivery of our internet sites  print publications and creation of our product database and related technology 
the principal elements of cost of revenues for our operations are compensation and related expenses for the editorial  production and technology staff and related costs for facilities and equipment  as well as costs to print and distribute our magazines 
the majority of our cost of revenues does not necessarily fluctuate proportionately with fluctuations in revenues 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses  consulting fees and advertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment

we continued to drive revenue growth through our combined efforts of extending our relationships with our traditional advertisers and gaining more share of spending from general consumer advertisers

in  we were able to achieve revenue growth that exceeded the growth in operating expenses  which allowed us to meet our goal of over percent year over year incremental margin

year ended december  in thousands  except per share data operating income loss depreciation amortization asset impairment operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment net income loss net income loss per diluted share we believe that operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment is useful to management and investors as a supplement to our gaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states financial measures for evaluating the ability of the business to generate cash from operations 
depreciation and amortization are non cash items and include within them amounts related to past transactions and expenditures that are not necessarily reflective of the current cash or capital requirements of the business 
asset impairment is a non cash item that does not reflect upon the ability of the business to generate cash from operations 
management refers to operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment in making operating decisions and for planning and compensation purposes 
a limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue 
management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial measures  such as capital expenditures  and using operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment only on a supplemental basis 
although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the capitalized assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
this measure also does not take into account interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt 
nor does the measure reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs 
operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
outlook for we are focused on expanding our content coverage and services to help us continue to grow the number of users visiting our properties and to increase user engagement 
we expect revenue growth as a result of increased spending from existing advertisers  as well as new advertisers 
we expect our growth in revenues to continue to exceed any incremental increase in operating costs before depreciation  amortization and stock compensation 
we expect that online revenues will represent an increasing proportion of international revenues  reflecting faster online revenue growth than publishing 
we will begin to recognize expenses for stock options in with the implementation of financial accounting standards board statement r  share based payments 
compensation cost for all employee 
table of contents share based payments in is expected to be between million and million after the adoption of statement r 
however  these amounts may vary with the level of equity awards and the grant date value of those awards

a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period due to activities such as acquisitions and debt or equity transactions

liquidity outlook we believe that existing funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to cover operations and for working capital fluctuations and for capital expenditures for the next months 
however  any significant acquisitions completed in the future or declines in the operating performance of our business could reduce our cash balances and may affect our liquidity and funding needs 
as a result  we may determine to raise proceeds for potential acquisitions through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
our ability to raise such additional capital will depend on market conditions at the time

our ability to raise additional capital will depend on our financial performance and market conditions at the time

if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  cnet networks would be required to make their lease payments under the guarantee 
in addition  any expiration of any sublease and the potential resulting vacancy along with the inability of ziff davis media  inc  the primary lessee  to cover the vacancy lease payments could result in cnet networks being required to make lease payments on those vacancies 
in connection with that guarantee  we also have a letter of credit for million outstanding as a security deposit 
as there is no present obligation to make any payments in connection with this guarantee  cnet networks has not recorded any liability for this guarantee in its financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to collectibility of receivables  investments  goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues once the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of our obligation to our customer has occurred  the price to be charged to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the fees to be charged is reasonably assured 
we have several revenue streams 
for each revenue stream  evidence of the arrangement  delivery and pricing may be different 
for all revenue streams  we determine that collectibility is reasonably assured through a standardized credit review to determine each customer s credit worthiness
