recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas no 
r which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for share based payments transactions with employees and other third parties  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amended the effective date of sfas r 
the effective date of the new standard under these new rules for the company s consolidated financial statements was january  the company has elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective application under the bi nomial method and is currently assessing the impact that the statement will have on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  concentrations  allowance for 
table of contents doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill 
these policies and the company s procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the company s accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes its multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services  using the residual method under sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin s sab revenue recognition in financial statements and sab no 
revenue recognition and emerging issues task force accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
key factors in the company s revenue recognition model are management s assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the company s software whereas implementation services are not 
if the company s business model were to change such that implementation services became essential to the functionality of the company s software  the period of time over which the company s licensed software revenue were to be recognized would lengthen 
the company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of its licensed software over two key milestones  delivery and installation  based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation 
additionally  if the time to achieve the company s delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated  its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change 
software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
the company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the healthcare information technology market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
concentrations substantially all of the company s clients are integrated delivery networks  hospitals and other healthcare related organizations 
if significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the company 
the company s access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers 
the inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future results 
allowance for doubtful accounts if the creditworthiness of the company s clients were to weaken or the company s collections results relative to historical experience were to decline  it could have a material adverse impact on operations and cash flows 
goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or 
table of contents whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value 
the company again assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of and and concluded that no goodwill was impaired 
the company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods 
the company completed eight acquisitions and one divestiture subsequent to june   which resulted in approximately million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with sfas goodwill amounted to  and  at december  and january   respectively 
if future  anticipated cash flows from the company s reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected the company s goodwill could be impaired  which would result in significant write offs 
factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business statements made in this report  the annual report to shareholders in which this report is made a part  other reports and proxy statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  communications to shareholders  press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the company that are not historical in nature  or that state the company s or management s intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations or predictions of the future  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act
