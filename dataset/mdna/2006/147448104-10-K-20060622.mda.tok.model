item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information  included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
company overview casella waste systems  inc  together with its subsidiaries  is a vertically integrated regional solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services to residential  industrial and commercial customers  primarily throughout the eastern region of the united states 
we believe we are currently the number one or number two provider of solid waste collection services in approximately of the areas served by our collection divisions 
in most of the non urban markets we serve  we are the only vertically integrated public company providing solid waste services 
we have years of experience operating in less densely populated secondary markets  which distinguishes us from other regional and national competitors 
our expertise enables us to deal effectively with the unique nature of these markets  which include longer collection routes and seasonal fluctuations 
as of may   we owned and or operated nine subtitle d landfills  two landfills permitted to accept construction and demolition materials  solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  recycling facilities and one waste to energy facility  as well as a interest in a joint venture that manufactures  markets and sells cellulose insulation made from recycled fiber 
in december  we acquired kti  an integrated provider of waste processing services  for aggregate consideration of million 
following our acquisition of kti  through  we focused on the integration of kti and the divestiture of non core kti assets 
from to date  we have focused on building our disposal capacity within our footprint  using our partnership model 
we believe we have been successful  because we added hardwick at the end of fiscal year and southbridge in massachusetts  ontario in upper new york state and juniper ridge formerly west old town in maine  all in fiscal year  chemung county landfill in new york in fiscal year  as well as expanded our annual permit limits and overall capacity at our other sites that we own or operate 
in fiscal year and we were successful in securing an increase of our permitted volume capacity at our hakes and waste usa landfill facilities and our hyland landfill facility received a necessary local approval for the future expansion of the site subject to receipt of permits 
in late september the company commenced operations at the chemung county landfill  after executing a twenty five year operating  management and lease agreement with chemung county  new york 
the landfill is permitted to accept  tons per year of municipal solid waste 
the company has also assumed operations of the solid waste transfer station and recycling facility 
the company made initial payments of million related to this transaction 
in january  the company assumed the closure contract for the worcester  massachusetts landfill 
purchase consideration was comprised of forgiveness of receivables and assumption of certain liabilities amounting to million 
in december   through an agreement with the town of colebrook  nh  we began accepting non hazardous waste to shape  cap  and close that town s landfill site 
approximately  tons of capacity have been created through this project and the project is expected to last approximately three years 
the annual tons disposed in our landfills have increased from million tons in fiscal year to million tons in fiscal year  and total permitted and permittable capacity has increased from tons at may  to million tons at april  we have also closed on tuck in acquisitions during that time 
from may  through april   we acquired solid waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal operations 
in fiscal year the company acquired solid waste hauling and recycling operations 
our objective in building disposal capacity is to increase our vertical integration within our footprint to optimize our control of the waste stream from collection through disposal  thereby providing an economic benefit 
internalization of waste refers to the amount of waste that our collection companies collect that is ultimately disposed of in one of our disposal facilities 
as a result of our success in building disposal capacity our internalization increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year on september  the company acquired blue mountain recycling  llc which has two single stream recycling facilities in philadelphia and montgomeryville  pennsylvania and a small recyclable material transfer station in upper dublin  pennsylvania 
blue mountain also has a processing agreement with recyclebank llc  an incentive based recycling service that gives homeowners credits for recycling which can be used with participating merchants 
the company continues to be focused on selectively pursuing accretive acquisitions with the goal of increasing route density and landfill internalization through tuck in opportunities and by acquiring or agreeing to operate strategically located landfills 
the company has also focused on measuring return on net assets as a metric to aligning performance with these stated objectives 
operating results the company publicly announced its guidance for fiscal year and stated that results would be in the following approximate ranges assuming no material change in the health of the regional economy  solid waste operation price growth of  fcr price growth to remain flat  and no major acquisitions revenues between million and million  total of expected capital expenditures between million and million  and free cash flow a non gaap measure between million and million 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company reported revenues of million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal year the company exceeded the high end of guidance due largely to the effect of acquisitions in fiscal year  which accounted for of the revenue growth year over year 
as a percentage of solid waste revenues  internal growth for solid waste operations in fiscal year was with from price increases 
as a percentage of fcr recycling revenues  internal growth in fiscal year was  primarily related to volume increases 
operating income for the year was million in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year higher revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs including higher fuel and transportation costs 
operating income in fiscal year was also negatively impacted by approximately million by the delayed start up of the worcester and colebrook closure projects 
in addition  due to the uncertainty as to if and when  if at all  the project can be restarted  a charge of million was recorded in fiscal year to write off the development costs incurred in pursuit of a contract to develop and operate the town of templeton  massachusetts sanitary landfill 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were million  which exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately million  mainly from the purchase of a boston municipal recycling facility  the ten year renewal of the mid conn contract and the conversion of the auburn municipal recycling facility to single stream 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure provided because certain investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of the solid waste industry  including us  and assists investors in measuring our ability to meet capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities 
our free cash flow for fiscal year and is calculated as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures other free cash flow negative free cash flow results for fiscal year exceeded our guidance mainly due to higher levels of capital expenditures as well as the effect of lower operating income margins as described above  and a larger negative change in working capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
landfill accounting capitalized costs and amortization we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs 
capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land and related airspace  permitting costs and preparation costs 
landfill permitting and preparation costs represent only direct costs related to these activities  including legal  engineering and construction 
landfill preparation costs include the costs of construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms and the installation of leak detection and leachate collection systems 
interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their intended use 
the interest capitalization rate is based on the company s weighted average cost of indebtedness 
interest capitalized for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
management routinely reviews its investment in operating landfills  transfer stations and other significant facilities to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under life cycle accounting  all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to income based on tonnage placed into each site 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and permittable capacity 
in determining estimated future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs  we consider the landfill costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
to be considered permittable  airspace must meet all of the following criteria we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received  and senior management has approved the project 
units of consumption amortization rates are determined annually for each of our operating landfills 
the rates are based on estimates provided by our engineers and accounting personnel and consider the information provided by airspace surveys  which are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could materially increase our landfill depletion rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our estimate of future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs as of april  increased to million  compared to million as of april  and million as of april  the increase in estimated costs in fiscal is primarily as a result of additional permitted and permittable airspace from our newly acquired landfill operating contract at chemung  which increased airspace to million tons as of april  as compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  the increase in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  is primarily due to a determination of additional permittable airspace capacity at our hyland  juniper ridge and waste usa landfills 
landfill amortization expense for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in landfill amortization expense in fiscal year was primarily due to lower volumes in the south eastern region resulting from the completion of the brockton project  partially offset by increased amortization associated with the startup of the worcester and colebrook closure projects and the chemung county landfill 
the increase in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily attributable to increased landfill volumes in part resulting from our landfill operating contracts at ontario  southbridge and juniper ridge  which became active in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year landfill accounting capping  closure and post closure costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
closure and post closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
our estimates of costs to discharge capping  closure and post closure asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs are then inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and for fiscal year and  respectively 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are discounted using the credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred to 
accretion expense is necessary to increase the accrued capping  closure and post closure liabilities to the future anticipated obligation 
to accomplish this  we accrete our capping  closure and post closure accrual balances using the same credit adjusted  risk free rate that was used to calculate the recorded liability 
accretion expense on recorded landfill liabilities is recorded to cost of operations from the time the liability is recognized until the costs are paid 
accretion expense amounted to million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs was million as of april   compared to million as of april  and million as of april  the increase in estimated costs in fiscal is primarily as a result of additional permitted and permittable airspace from our newly acquired landfill operating contract at chemung  which also increased airspace to million tons as of april  compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  the increase in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  is primarily due to a determination of additional permittable airspace capacity at our hyland  juniper ridge and waste usa landfills 
we provide for the accrual and amortization of estimated future obligations for closure and post closure based on tonnage placed into each site 
with regards to capping  the liability is recognized and these costs are amortized based on the airspace related to the specific capping event 
accrued capping  closure and post closure costs include the current and non current portion of costs associated with obligations for capping  closure and post closure of our landfills 
the changes to accrued capping  closure and post closure liabilities are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  beginning balance  may cumulative effect of change in accounting principle capping  closure  and post closure liability  adjusted obligations incurred revisions in estimates accretion expense payments acquisitions and other adjustments balance  april upon adoption of sfas no 
 on may   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to reflect a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure obligations of million 
the decrease resulted primarily from a sfas requirement that we discount our future estimated capping  closure and post closure landfill obligations 
spending levels increased in fiscal year mainly due to closure activities at our southbridge  massachusetts landfill 
the increase in fiscal is as a result of capping  closure and post closure accruals relating to the acquisition of the southbridge  massachusetts landfill operating contract 
we estimate our future capping  closure and post closure costs in order to determine the capping  closure and post closure expense per ton of waste placed into each landfill as further described in note l to our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated timeframe for paying these costs varies based on the remaining useful life of each landfill  as well as the duration of the post closure monitoring period 
based on our permitted and permittable airspace at april   we expect to make payments relative to capping  closure and post closure activities from fiscal year through fiscal year asset impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated discounted future cash flows to determine with the net book value of long term assets including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is then recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
upon adoption of sfas no 
we eliminated the amortization of goodwill and annually assess goodwill impairment at each fiscal year end by applying a fair value based test 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value of each operating segment 
we estimate fair value based on net future cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
we recognize an impairment if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the discounted future cash flows 
bad debt allowance estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable by aging category 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by management with the assistance of a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by reference to past claims experience  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
income tax accruals we record income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using currently enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets 
general revenues our revenues in our north eastern  south eastern  central and western regions are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
the majority of our disposal and transfer customers are under one to ten year disposal contracts  with most having clauses for annual cost of living increases 
recycling revenues  which are included in fcr and the central and western regions  consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
our cellulose insulation business is conducted through a joint venture with louisiana pacific  and accordingly  we recognize half of the joint venture s net income on the equity method in our results of operations 
also  in the other segment  we have ancillary revenues including major customer accounts and earnings from equity method investees 
our revenues are shown net of inter company eliminations 
we typically establish our inter company transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentages and dollars of revenue attributable to services provided 
for the fiscal year ended april   the percentages of revenues shown below reflect revenues from the domestic brokerage and recycling operations through june  the domestic brokerage operation  constituting the remainder of our brokerage revenues  was transferred effective june  to the employees of that unit 
despite an increase in the absolute dollar amounts  collection revenues as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal year were lower compared to the prior year  mainly because of the increase in landfill revenue dollars 
total collection volume  including the positive impact of acquisitions in the central and western regions  was down  which was more than offset by price increases across all regions 
landfill disposal revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal year due to higher landfill prices across all regions and the effect of the addition of chemung landfill in the western region and the worcester and colebrook closure projects in the south eastern and central regions 
landfill disposal volumes increased in all regions except the south eastern region due to the completion of the brockton closure project 
recycling revenues as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal year were lower compared to the prior year  despite an increase in the absolute dollar amounts  mainly because of the increase in landfill revenue dollars 
the increase in recycling revenue dollars is primarily attributable to higher volumes from our existing facilities as well as the acquisition of blue mountain recycling in the fcr region 
fiscal year ended april  collection landfill disposal facilities transfer recycling brokerage total revenues we revised percentages of total revenues and total revenue attributable to service provided for fiscal year ended april  to conform with our classification of revenues attributable to services provided in the current fiscal year 
operating expenses cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to landfill capping  closure and post closure  leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations 
general and administration expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with marketing  sales force and community relations efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of consumption method  and the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill using the straight line method 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  except for accretion expense  we amortize landfill retirement assets through a charge to cost of operations using a straight line rate per ton as landfill airspace is utilized 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  other than goodwill  to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
we will have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for these future financial obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that certain items from our consolidated financial statements bear in relation to revenues 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of operations general and administration depreciation and amortization impairment charge deferred costs operating income interest expense  net income from equity method investments loss on debt extinguishment other income expense  net provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year revenues from the rollover effect of acquired businesses accounted for million of the increase  including tuck in hauling acquisitions in the central and western regions  newly acquired landfill closure projects in the central and south eastern regions  the acquisition of two recycling facilities and a small recyclable material transfer station in the fcr region and the new chemung contract to operate a landfill and transfer station in the western region 
the effect of acquisitions was partially offset by million as a result of the transfer of a canadian recycling operation to its former manager 
the revenue increase is also attributable to an increase in solid waste revenues of million  due to higher prices and landfill volumes in the north eastern and western regions 
fcr revenue increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to volume increases  pricing being flat to down slightly 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal year from in the prior year 
the percentage increase in cost of operations expense is primarily due to higher fuel costs as well as higher transportation costs arising from the shipments of higher volumes to our landfills and the higher than expected costs associated with the obligation to provide wood chips to a bio fuel plant in connection with the acquisition of the juniper ridge landfill in the north eastern region 
general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the dollar increase in general and administration expenses was due to higher legal  travel  compensation  consulting costs related to software development  communication and training costs and expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
deferred costs 
due to the uncertainty regarding if and when the project will be restarted  a charge of million was recorded in fiscal year to write off the development costs incurred in pursuit of a contract to develop and operate the town of templeton  massachusetts sanitary landfill 
a charge of million was recorded in fiscal year to reflect the write off of development costs associated with the unsuccessful negotiations for the development and operation of the mckean county  pennsylvania landfill 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while depreciation expense increased by million between periods  landfill amortization expense decreased by million primarily due to the south eastern region brockton project reaching completion  amounting to a million decrease  partially offset by increased amortization associated with the startup of the worcester and colebrook closure projects and the chemung county landfill 
operating income 
operating income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the margin decrease was due to higher revenues being partially offset by higher operating costs and deferred costs as described above 
the north eastern region s operating income increased slightly in fiscal year compared to the prior year due to higher collection volumes and pricing and higher operating income at the maine energy facility due to higher power production 
the south eastern region s operating income increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to lower landfill amortization  partially offset by deferred costs as mentioned above 
the central and western region s operating income decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to higher operating costs and in the western region  the temporary closing of the wellsboro location and the associated legal costs 
fcr s operating income increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year due to the effect of the acquisitions  partially offset by higher operating costs 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase is attributable to higher average interest rates along with higher average borrowings in fiscal year compared to the prior year  driven by the higher capital expenditures in fiscal year versus plus the acquisitions 
income from equity method investments 
the income from equity method investment of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  was primarily from the company s joint venture interest in greenfiber 
the increase is attributable to higher sales volume and prices in the current fiscal year compared to the prior year comparable period 
late in the third quarter of fiscal year the company made a million investment  representing a interest  in recyclebank llc  a company which markets an incentive based recycling service that gives homeowners credits for recycling which can be used with participating merchants 
this investment is accounted for as an equity method investment 
the loss from this equity method investment was million in fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income in fiscal year was million compared to other expense of million in fiscal year other income in fiscal year consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of sterling construction  inc formerly oakhurst company  inc warrants in the amount of million 
at the time of sale  there was no book value associated with these warrants as they had been previously written off 
also included in other income in both periods are dividends of million from our investment in evergreen national indemnity company evergreen 
other expense in fiscal year consisted of the costs of winding down the operations of the new heights power plant and a loss on retirement of fixed assets  partially offset by gains on the sale of equipment and the dividend from evergreen 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the overall state tax rate and a decrease in the valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year slightly higher operating income  higher income from the equity method investments and lower other expenses were partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
income from discontinued operations loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the assets of data destruction services  inc data destruction for cash sale proceeds of million 
this shredding operation had been historically accounted for as a component of continuing operations up until its sale 
the transaction required discontinued operations treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  therefore the operating results of data destruction have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in fiscal and also in connection with the discontinued accounting treatment  the loss net of tax from the sale amounting to million has been recorded and classified as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year revenues from the rollover effect of acquired businesses accounted for million of the increase  primarily due to new disposal facilities in the western and south eastern regions the ontario and southbridge landfills  as well as a new recycling facility in the south eastern region  all of which became active in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  partially offset by the loss of revenues from the divestiture of the domestic brokerage business amounting to million 
the revenue increase is also attributable to an increase in solid waste revenues of million  due primarily to higher hauling and transfer volumes in the central region  higher composting volumes in the north eastern region and higher commodity prices which resulted in an increase in recycling revenues of million 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the fiscal year  from in the prior year primarily due to the effect of lower disposal costs as a percentage of revenue from the impact of the activation of new disposal capacity 
the dollar increase in cost of operations expense for fiscal year is primarily due to the effect of higher levels of operating activity and acquired businesses  higher cost of commodity purchases due to higher prices  higher transportation costs as well as higher fuel costs 
general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administration expenses as a percentage of revenues remained unchanged in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the dollar increase in general and administration expense was due to higher bonus accruals  communications and training costs as well as expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while depreciation expense increased by million between periods  landfill amortization expense increased by million which was primarily due to higher volumes  in part related to new disposal facilities which became active in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues remained unchanged in fiscal year compared to fiscal year impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of a million write down of our investment in resource optimization technology rot  a compost facility  which we transferred at no cost to a third party in february  a charge of million relating to the sale of buildings and land at our former recycling facility in mechanics falls  maine  and a charge of million related to the discontinuation of an effort to develop a new landfill project in rockingham  vt 
deferred costs 
a charge of million was recorded in fiscal to reflect the write off of deferred development costs associated with unsuccessful negotiations to operate and develop a landfill located in mckean county  pennsylvania 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in operating income is primarily due to higher levels of revenue 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this increase is mainly attributable to higher average debt balances due to higher capital expenditures and payments on landfill operating lease contracts as well as higher average interest rates in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
net interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year income from equity method investments 
income from equity method investments for fiscal years ended april  and was solely from our joint venture interest in greenfiber 
equity income from greenfiber increased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase is attributable to higher volume as well as increased pricing 
loss on debt extinguishment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we entered into a new senior secured credit facility resulting in the write off of million in debt financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
other income expense  net 
other expense in fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year other expense in fiscal year consisted of the costs of winding down the operations of the new heights power plant and a loss on retirement of fixed assets  partially offset by gains on the sale of equipment and a dividend from our investment in evergreen national indemnity company 
other expense in fiscal year included an million charge for the write down of our investment in the new heights power plant venture and our remaining investment in certain tire recycling operations and the power plant venture 
offsetting this charge  we recognized a gain of million on the completion of our sale of its export recyclables business and other gains  primarily on the sale of trucks and containers  of million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the effective tax rate increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to a prior year decrease in the valuation allowance for loss carryforwards as utilization of the company s tax losses became more certain 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is due to increased operating income  partially offset by increased interest expense and higher tax expense due to a higher effective tax rate 
income loss from discontinued operations loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the assets of data destruction for cash sale proceeds of million 
this shredding operation had been historically accounted for as a component of continuing operations up until its sale 
the transaction required discontinued operations treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  therefore the operating results of data destruction have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in fiscal and also in connection with the discontinued accounting treatment  the loss net of tax from the sale amounting to million has been recorded and classified as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
effective may   we adopted sfas no

the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is to require that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value

we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million in order to reflect the cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development and cell construction  as well as site and cell closure 
our capital expenditures are broadly defined as pertaining to either growth or maintenance activities 
growth capital expenditures are defined as costs related to development of new airspace  permit expansions  new recycling contracts along with incremental costs of equipment and infrastructure added to further such activities 
growth capital expenditures include the cost of equipment added directly as a result of new business as well as expenditures associated with increasing infrastructure to increase throughput at transfer stations and recycling facilities 
growth capital expenditures also include those outlays associated with acquiring landfill operating leases  which do not meet the operating lease payment definition  but which were included as a commitment in the successful bid 
maintenance capital expenditures are defined as landfill cell construction costs not related to expansion airspace  costs for normal permit renewals and replacement costs for equipment due to age or obsolescence 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year growth capital expenditures were and million in fiscal years and respectively  and maintenance capital expenditures were and million in fiscal years and respectively 
capital spending was higher in fiscal year mainly due to capital expenditures related to newly acquired landfill operating contracts and existing landfills as well as upgrades to equipment at various recycling facilities 
we expect capital spending to amount to between million and million in fiscal year the continued high level of capital expenditures is mainly due to growth capital expenditures at the landfills as well as completion of recycling facility upgrades 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at april  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at april  working capital  net comprises current assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  minus current liabilities 
the main factors accounting for the increase were deferred taxes and higher trade receivables associated with higher revenue as well as lower payroll accruals associated with lower management bonus accruals 
this was partially offset by higher accrued interest related to higher borrowings on our credit facility as well as higher interest rates 
also offsetting the increase in working capital were higher accruals at april  primarily associated with higher self insurance reserves 
on april   we entered into a new senior credit facility with a group of banks for which bank of america is acting as agent 
the credit facility consists of a senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
under certain circumstances we have the option of increasing the credit facility by an additional million provided that we are not in default at the time of the increase  and subject to the receipt of commitments from lenders for such additional amount 
this credit facility is secured by all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures april the initial borrowings under the credit facility were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the former term loan and revolver 
further advances were available under the credit facility in the amount of million and million as of april  and  respectively 
these available amounts are net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling million and as of april  and the availability was reduced in fiscal year from the prior year due to higher capital expenditures and the issuance of a million letter of credit associated with the revenue bond discussed below 
as of april  and no amounts had been drawn under the outstanding letters of credit 
the credit facility agreement contains covenants that may limit our activities  including covenants that restrict dividends on common stock  limit capital expenditures  and set minimum net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of april   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we completed an amendment to the credit facility agreement on june  this amended the capital expenditure covenant effective april  and other covenants effective july  see note to the financial statements for further disclosure regarding the amendment to the credit facility agreement 
in fiscal year  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million as a result of the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements to balance fixed and floating rate debt interest risk in accordance with management s criteria 
the agreements are contracts to exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments periodically over a specified term without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
the agreements provide only for the exchange of interest on the notional amounts at the stated rates  with no multipliers or leverage 
differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt 
we terminated two interest rate swap agreements effective april  concurrent with entering into the new credit facility 
we received net proceeds of million which were amortized against interest expense over the original term of the swap contracts  to february on may   we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements with three banks for a notional amount of million 
the contracts are forward starting contracts that effectively fixed the interest index rate on the entire notional amount at from may  through may  as of april   we had outstanding million of senior subordinated notes the notes which mature in january the senior subordinated note indenture contains covenants that restrict dividends  stock repurchases and other payments  and limits the incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock 
the notes are guaranteed jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally by our significant wholly owned subsidiaries 
on december   we completed a million financing transaction involving the issuance by the finance authority of maine the authority of million aggregate principal amount of its solid waste disposal revenue bonds casella waste systems  inc project series the bonds 
the bonds are issued pursuant to an indenture  dated as of december  the indenture and are enhanced by an irrevocable  transferable direct pay letter of credit issued by bank of america  na pursuant to a financing agreement  dated as of december   by and between us and the authority  we have borrowed the proceeds of the bonds to pay for certain costs relating to landfill development and construction  vehicle  container and related equipment acquisition for solid waste collection and transportation services  improvements to existing solid waste disposal  hauling  transfer station and other facilities  other infrastructure improvements  and machinery and equipment for solid waste disposal operations owned and operated by us  or a related party  all located in maine  and the issuance of the bonds 
at april   remaining issuance proceeds of million were recorded as restricted cash to be used to pay for the capital expenditures in maine as they are incurred 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years ended april  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
factors positively impacting the comparison to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year against the prior year included higher income from equity method investments  coupled with a distribution payment received from green fiber in fiscal amounting to million  which was not repeated in fiscal year  a decrease in landfill amortization of million which was primarily associated with the brockton project reaching completion  and changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures which decreased million from the prior year 
the increase in accounts receivable at april   which is associated with higher revenues  resulted in a million reduction compared with a decrease of million in fiscal year the decrease in accounts payable in fiscal year resulted in a million decrease compared to an increase of million in fiscal year this is due primarily to higher trade accounts payable at april  associated with the timing of various capital improvement expenditures 
changes in other assets and liabilities increased million from the prior year due primarily to the following higher interest accruals in the current fiscal year amounting to a million which increase is related to higher borrowings and higher interest rates  higher capping  closure and post closure accruals amounting to million  attributable to lower cash payments in fiscal year and higher self insurance reserves and other accruals amounting to million 
these increases were offset by reductions in accrued payroll and related expenses amounting to million in the fiscal year compared to fiscal year as well as higher prepaid and other current assets amounting to million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year and fiscal year amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a million increase in capital expenditures as well as higher acquisition activity amounting to an increase of million in the current fiscal year  offset by a decrease in payments on landfill operating lease contracts of million in fiscal year also contributing to the increase in cash used in investing activities were revenue bond issuance proceeds restricted for specific capital expenditures amounting to million at april  net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to higher net borrowings  including the revenue bond financing described above 
higher net borrowings in fiscal year were used to fund capital expenditure and acquisition activity 
in fiscal year  we acquired fifteen solid waste hauling  disposal and recycling operations for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in notes payable and in other liabilities assumed 
we also obtained a landfill operating lease contract in fiscal year for the chemung county landfill which also includes a transfer station and recycling facility 
in fiscal year  we acquired ten solid waste hauling and disposal operations for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in other liabilities assumed 
for the landfill operating lease contracts  we made payments totaling million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we generally meet liquidity needs from operating cash flow 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for landfill development  vehicles and containers  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures 
it is our intention to continue to grow organically and through acquisitions 
the funds to do so are expected to be obtained from operations and our credit facility which has an accordion feature for an additional million in credit availability 
at april  at our existing covenant requirements  as amended june   all of the funds available under that facility could have been drawn without breaching those covenants 
we will be required to redeem our outstanding series a redeemable preferred stock on august   if it is not otherwise repurchased by the us prior to that time 
the aggregate redemption price is expected to be approximately million 
we would need to incur more debt or raise equity to effect this redemption 
we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
we could from time to time issue securities thereunder in an amount of up to million 
however  our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s ending april  thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations interest obligations operating leases closure post closure redeemable preferred securities total contractual cash obligations interest obligations based on long term debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
assumes redemption on the seventh anniversary of the closing date at the book value which includes all accrued and unpaid dividends 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year we believe that our cash provided internally from operations together with our senior secured credit facility  including the accordion feature for an additional million  should enable us to meet our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover fuel price fluctuations 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
new accounting standards effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
through april  we recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed  with the exception of future landfill capping costs 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 future capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill  as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption  sfas no 
required a cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill 
inception of the asset retirement obligation is the date operations commenced or the date the asset was acquired 
to do this  sfas no 
required the creation of the related landfill asset  net of accumulated amortization and an adjustment to the capping  closure and post closure liability for cumulative accretion 
at may   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
and requires public companies to recognize compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity instruments 
this compensation cost will be measured as the fair value of the award on the grant date estimated using an option pricing model 
sfas no 
r will become effective at the beginning of the first fiscal year after june  we are evaluating the various transition provisions under sfas no 
r and will adopt sfas no 
r effective may   which is expected to result in increased compensation expense in future periods 
in april  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
expands on the accounting guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 providing clarification of the term  conditional asset retirement obligation  and guidelines for the timing of recording the obligation 
we adopted sfas no 
effective may  the interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb no 
 and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
specifically  this statement requires retrospective application of the direct effect for a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements  if it is practicable to do so 
sfas no 
also strictly redefines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements 
sfas no 
replaces apb no 
 which requires that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
unless adopted early  sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at april   our outstanding variable rate debt consisted of the million senior secured revolving credit facility and million of fame bonds 
if interest rates on this variable rate debt increased or decreased by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million 
the remainder of our debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk 
on may   we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements with three banks for a notional amount of million 
the contracts are forward starting contracts that will effectively fix the interest index rate on the entire notional amount at from may  through may  these agreements will be specifically designated to interest payments under the revolving credit facility and will be accounted for as effective cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no 
we are subject to commodity price fluctuations related to the portion of our sales of recyclable commodities that are not under floor or flat pricing arrangements 
as of april   to minimize our commodity exposure  we were party to thirty six commodity hedging agreements 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
if commodity prices were to change by  the impact on our operating income is estimated at million as of april   without considering our hedging agreements  which are solely for occ and onp  but considering our revenue share contracts 
the use of the company s hedge instruments would reduce the impact by approximately million
