general valassis reported record revenues of  million for  up over valassis results for reflect revenue growth in all of our business segments  with our second largest segment  neighborhood targeted  experiencing over revenue growth year over year 
the cooperative fsi industry experienced mid single digit unit page growth in while industry page growth was positive and our fsi market share increased  overall fsi pricing declined slightly in  in comparison to this decline in fsi pricing had a negative impact on profits in the fsi segment 
management anticipates fsi pricing to be down by a percentage in the mid to high single digits versus as the result of an aggressive competitive environment and the renegotiation of a contract with a major client 
due to the multi year nature of fsi customer contracts  the economic impact of the competitive pricing environment will continue into future periods even if pricing improves for new contracts

 consumer packaged goods manufacturers telecommunications specialty retailers food service direct response marketers consumer services grocery drug and mass retailers other types of customers we also continue to focus on diversifying our product portfolio  broadening our product and services offerings to our customers  while positioning ourselves to benefit from the many macro trends we are observing in the marketplace 
we anticipate that customers will continue to link marketing spending to revenue generation  leading marketers to choose promotional alternatives that provide measurable return on investment 
we also expect marketing dollars to shift to home delivered promotional media due to increases in television fragmentation  the rise of television commercial blocking products  growth in commercial free radio programming and greater participation in the national do not call list

gross margin in was versus in and in the decrease in gross margin percentage from compared to and from compared to was primarily the result of competitive pricing issues in the fsi segment 
fsi unit costs were nearly flat as the result of mid single digit increases in paper costs offset by decreases in media insertion rates 
additionally  the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by a change in mix resulting in a larger percentage of sales from lower margin products 
selling  general and administrative costs increased in to million versus million in this increase is primarily the result of million in restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the full integration of the components of our household targeted business segment  which resulted in the elimination of prevision as a stand alone entity  right sizing of coupon clearing operations primarily in europe and other efficiency related headcount reductions 
the remaining increase was due to increases in performance based incentive plans and investments being made in future growth opportunities 
non operating items interest expense was million in  compared to million in and million in the refinancing of our long term debt in may resulted in an overall reduction in our borrowing rate

the cooperative fsi industry continued to show unit growth with industry pages increasing by a percentage in the mid single digits in fsi unit costs were up slightly as a result of mid single digit percentage increases in paper costs 
fsi revenues in were also impacted by downward pricing pressure as well as a loss in market share  resulting in a revenue increase of less than compared to paper represents approximately of the cost of sales for our fsi business 
valassis purchases a combination of coated and uncoated paper 
to protect valassis against the risk of price fluctuations  a significant portion of our paper requirements is purchased from three paper companies under long term contracts 
these contracts limit the amount of increases or decreases to approximately in any calendar year of valassis cost of paper purchased from these suppliers 
such cost can be adjusted quarterly 
as of january   approximately of our fsi paper requirements were under long term contract 
the remainder of our paper requirement is bought pursuant to contracts that are typically three to six months in duration or on a spot basis 
rop revenue for rop increased in to million from million in  due to acquisition of new retail and cpg customers 
the gross margin in this segment also improved and operating profits grew in excess of for revenue growth continues to be driven by telecommunications advertising which represented approximately of our rop business in run of press revenue was up million  or  in to million versus changes in terms of certain contracts away from transaction fee based business net revenue to gross revenue business accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining million increase was due to incremental business  most notably in the telecommunications customer sector

in neighborhood targeted revenue was million  a increase over million in the major drivers of this growth were increased demand for solo inserts and polybag advertising programs and a continued rebound in customer product sampling 
household targeted the household targeted segment had revenue of million in  an increase of over million in  despite the fact that we no longer have access to a major retailer s data affecting our ability to sell certain direct mail programs in we are currently in the process of replacing this data source with another large retailer 
we also focused in on repositioning this segment by fully integrating our products and services and eliminating prevision marketing  llc as a stand alone entity 
we effectively exited the customer relationship marketing agency business and now provide these services only to customers placing their related media campaigns with us 
household targeted revenues were up in to million versus million in approximately million of this growth relates to the purchase of direct marketing services  the direct mail division of catalina marketing

international services the international services segment contributed revenues of million in  a increase over million in valassis implemented a restructuring plan for the european coupon clearing operations which adversely affected the overall profitability of this segment during the fourth quarter of international services revenue was million in versus million in the inclusion of nch for the entire year in accounted for million of this increase and favorable european exchange rates accounted for an additional million 
financial condition  liquidity and sources of capital valassis liquidity requirements arise mainly from its working capital needs  primarily accounts receivable  inventory and debt service requirements 
cooperative fsi customers except remnant space customers are generally billed for of each order eight weeks in advance of the publication date and the balance is billed immediately prior to the publication date 
fsi revenue accounted for of valassis total revenue in valassis inventories work in progress at cost while it accrues progress billings as a current liability at full sales value 
although valassis receives considerable payments from its customers prior to the publication of promotions  revenue is recognized only upon publication dates 
therefore  the progress billings on the balance sheet include any profits in the related receivables 
the majority of the revenue generated by nch  a owned subsidiary of valassis  is from its coupon clearing business 
nch invoices the face value of the coupon  a retailer handling fee if applicable as well as nch s processing fee 
the face value and the retailer handling fee are ultimately remitted by nch to retailers and their agents 
nch records a gross receivable and payable for the coupon face value as well as the retailer handling fees and recognizes revenue only on the nch processing fee 
sources and uses of cash cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  versus million at december  this decrease was the result of cash provided by operating activities and investing activities of million and  respectively  and cash used by financing activities of million during the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities was million in this is the result of net earnings of million adjusted for non cash items  the largest of which are depreciation and amortization totaling million 
in  changes in working capital accounted for a million decrease in cash 
during  changes in working capital accounted for a million decrease in cash primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable due to slower collections within the rop segment 
collections improved significantly in net cash provided from investing activities was  primarily as a result of million in net sales for auction rate securities to fund the share repurchase program 
this is offset by capital expenditures of  which includes million received for insurance proceeds for the rebuilding of our facility in corby  england 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ending december   primarily driven by million used for our increased share repurchase program 
current and long term debt as of december   valassis debt was million  which consists of million million  net of discount of its senior notes due  million of zero coupon senior convertible notes due  and million of senior convertible notes due in addition  we have a revolving line of credit of million with a variable rate of interest calculated on either a euro currency based rate or a prime rate 
during the year ended december   there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit 
valassis was in compliance with all debt covenants at december  all of our long term debt contains cross default provisions which become applicable if we default under any mortgage  indebtedness or instrument for money borrowed by valassis and the default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in excess of million 
additionally  each of the senior convertible notes contains conversion triggers based upon credit rating downgrades by either moody s investor service  inc or standard poor s rating group 
in may  valassis issued million of senior convertible notes due  with a yield to maturity of per year 
we utilized approximately million of the proceeds to repurchase million in face value of our zero coupon convertible senior notes due the resulting premium and write off of fees and discounts resulted in a million refinancing charge 
the holders of valassis zero coupon senior convertible notes due the notes had the option to require valassis to purchase all or a portion of their notes on june  at a price of per  of principal amount at maturity  payable in cash or common stock at valassis option 
of the  bonds outstanding at that date   were put back to valassis 
valassis chose to settle the put with cash and  as such  paid million on june  to the trustee of the notes 
the remaining debt balance related to the notes is approximately million  which represents the accreted value of the notes as of december  the remaining holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on june   june  and june   at a price of  and per note  respectively  payable in cash 
therefore  the million outstanding balance of this debt has been classified as current as of december  valassis had the right to pay for the june  put in either cash or common stock 
valassis waived its right to settle this put in common stock 
also  each holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes if a change of control of valassis occurs on or before june  valassis  at its option  may redeem all or a portion of the notes at their accreted value at any time on or after june   for cash 
the holders of the senior convertible notes due the notes receive cash interest payments of per year on the original discounted amount  payable semiannually from through the holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on may   may   may   may  and may  at a price of    and per note  respectively  payable in cash or common stock at the option of valassis 
valassis waived its right to settle these puts in common stock 
also  each holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes if a change of control of valassis occurs 
valassis  at its option  may redeem all or a portion of the notes at their accreted value at any time on or after may   for cash 
future commitments and contractual obligations valassis intends to use cash generated by operations to meet interest and principal repayment obligations  for general corporate purposes  to reduce its indebtedness  to make acquisitions and to repurchase common stock through our share repurchase programs 
as of december   valassis had authorization to repurchase an additional million shares of its common stock under its existing share repurchase programs 
management believes we will generate sufficient funds from operations and will have sufficient lines of credit available to meet anticipated liquidity needs  including interest and required payments of indebtedness 
valassis contractual obligations as of december   are as follows payments due by period in thousands of us dollars total less than year years years more than years public debt revolving credit facility operating leases other long term liabilities interest non current long term debt is included at face value 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   valassis did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million net of million in assets purchased from a settlement of property insurance claim related to a fire at our corby  england facility for the year ended december   largely representing technology enhancements and the purchase of a new printing press 
management expects future capital expenditure requirements of approximately million to million over each of the next three to five years to meet the business needs of enhancing technology and replacing equipment as required 
it is expected these expenditures will be made using funds provided by operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
a conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to retire assets where the timing and or method of settlement are conditioned on future events 
fin no 
requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
in the adoption of this interpretation did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the standard  which is effective for the first annual period after june   requires that all equity based compensation be recorded in the financial statements at the grant date fair value 
currently  we disclose the pro forma net income and related pro forma income per share information in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
valassis will apply this statement to all equity based awards granted on or after january  and for the unvested portion of outstanding awards based on the grant date fair value of these awards previously calculated under sfas pro forma disclosures 
we presently expect the adoption of sfas r to increase our non cash compensation expenses by approximately million to million during in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  as such  valassis is required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal year we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our financial statements included in item valassis does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets historically have been reviewed for impairment at least annually in december and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
revenue recognition fsi revenue from fsis and custom cooperative fsis is recognized in the period that the product is distributed in the newspaper 
in accordance with industry practice  valassis generally pre bills fsi customers except remnant space in advance of the related distribution date 
however  these billings are reflected as progress billings liability until the appropriate distribution period 
provision for rebates or pricing adjustments are made at the time that the related revenue is recognized 
rop rop revenue is recognized on the date that the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
some customers have contracts whereby valassis earns a transaction fee and the media costs are pass through costs to the customer 
in such cases  valassis only recognizes the transaction fee as revenue on the date the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
customer contracts can vary which may lead to material changes in revenue for this segment  while not affecting absolute gross margin dollars 
neighborhood targeted the majority of neighborhood targeted products are newspaper delivered and revenue is recognized in the period that the product is distributed 
for non newspaper delivered products  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or distributed to the consumer via direct to door 
household targeted revenue for direct mail products is recognized when the product is accepted by the united states postal service for insertion into the mail stream 
in most cases  postage costs are passed through directly to the customer and are not recognized as revenue 
revenues from software products are recognized per installation and revenues from services are recognized on a percent complete method 
international services revenue for coupon clearing does not include the face value of the coupons processed or the retailer service fee 
however  customers are billed for the face value and retailer fee which are included in both accounts receivable and accounts payable 
once coupon processing has been completed  fee revenues are recognized 
stock compensation valassis grants stock options and restricted stock to its employees under various incentive plans 
options are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value on the date of grant 
we account for all stock compensation under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and make various estimates used in calculating the pro forma results as required by sfas no 
valassis will adopt sfas no 
r  as required  in derivative financial instruments valassis uses derivative financial instruments  including forward foreign exchange and swap contracts  to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments mitigates our exposure to these risks with the intent of reducing the risks and the variability of our operating results 
valassis is not a party to leveraged derivatives 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  valassis designates the derivative as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation a net investment hedge 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet 
when the underlying hedged transaction is realized  the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the hedged item 
in addition  both changes in the fair value excluded from our effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value are recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statement of income as other expense  net 
valassis formally documents its hedge relationships  including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long term assets and other current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets  liabilities  firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether a derivative used in a hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 did not have a material impact on operations for  or no cash flow hedges were re designated or discontinued during or auction rate securities auction rate securities ars are securities that have stated maturities beyond three months but are priced and traded as short term instruments due to the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset mechanism of to days 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities these auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at cost  or par value which approximates the fair market value 
other matters valassis does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
business outlook the following statements are based on expectations as of the filing of this document 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
valassis expects earnings per share for to be between and  including the effect of stock option expensing as required under fas r 
fsi pricing is expected to be down by a percentage in the mid to high single digits compared to capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are foreign exchange rates at valassis international subsidiaries  interest rates on various debt instruments and credit risk on investments 
foreign currency currencies to which valassis has exposure are the mexican peso  canadian dollar  british pound and the euro 
currency restrictions are not expected to have a significant effect on our cash flows  liquidity  or capital resources 
valassis typically purchases the mexican peso under three to month forward foreign exchange contracts to stabilize the cost of coupon clearing in mexico 
under sfas no 
 our mexican peso forward exchange contracts meet the definition of a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recorded an immaterial unrealized market value loss in other comprehensive income 
actual exchange losses or gains are recorded against production expense when the contracts are executed 
as of december   valassis had a commitment to purchase million in mexican pesos over the next months 
interest rates valassis has a revolving line of credit of million with a variable rate of interest calculated on either a euro currency based rate or a prime rate 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit and  therefore  no exposure to interest rate risk
