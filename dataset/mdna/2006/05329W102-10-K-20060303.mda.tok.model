certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented 
we have restated certain amounts in the and consolidated statements of cash flows from operating activities to financing activities to comply with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  statement of cash flows as a result of recent comments to us from the securities and exchange commission 
for the years ended december  and  million consisting of million in continuing operations and 
million in discontinued operations and million consisting of million in continuing operations and 
million in discontinued operations  respectively  which were previously reported as operating activities are reported as a component of financing activities to reflect the net cash flow uses for floorplan facilities with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise non trade lenders 
this change had the 
table of contents effect of increasing net cash from operating activities with the related offset in net cash from financing activities 
overview autonation  inc  through its subsidiaries  is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in states  predominantly in the sunbelt region of the united states 
our stores  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing more than of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by ford  general motors  daimler chrysler  toyota  nissan  honda and bmw 
we operate in a single industry segment  automotive retailing 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  vehicle maintenance and repair services  vehicle parts  extended service contracts  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products 
we also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  reducing operating expenses  leveraging our market brands and advertising  improving asset management and sharing and implementing common processes across all of our stores 
historically  new vehicle sales have accounted for approximately of our total revenue  but less than of our total gross margin 
our parts and service and finance and insurance operations  while comprising less than of total revenue  contribute approximately of our gross margin 
we believe that many factors affect industry wide sales of new and used vehicles and finance and insurance products  and retailers gross profit margins  including consumer confidence in the economy  the level of manufacturers excess production capacity  manufacturer incentives and consumers reaction to such offers  intense industry competition  interest rates  the prospects of war  other international conflicts or terrorist attacks  severe weather conditions  the level of personal discretionary spending  product quality  affordability and innovation  fuel prices  credit availability  unemployment rates  the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles 
our parts and service business is also impacted by these factors 
in  we had year over year overall same store gross profit growth driven by increases in used vehicles and parts and services 
this was despite a challenging fourth quarter of which was impacted by the effects of hurricane wilma on our florida stores and soft industry sales 
our performance is attributable to our emphasis on store processes  associate training and expense control 
in  we anticipate that industry wide new vehicle sales will remain stable nearly million units in the united states and continue to be highly competitive 
however  the level of retail sales for is very difficult to predict 
for the years ended december  and  we had net income from continuing operations of million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of and  respectively 
during and  we recorded net income tax benefits in continuing operations totaling million and million  respectively  primarily related to resolution of various income tax matters 
the results for include million after tax million pre tax of premium and deferred costs recognized as other interest expense related to the repurchase of million face value of our senior unsecured notes 
additionally  the results for were impacted by higher floorplan interest expense primarily resulting from higher short term libor interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory balances 
the net inventory carrying benefit floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance recognized from manufacturers for was million  a decrease of million compared to we expect net floorplan costs to continue to increase in as we experience increased interest rates 
during and  we had income from discontinued operations totaling million and million  respectively  net of income taxes 
in and  we recognized gains totaling million and million  respectively  included in discontinued operations related to the settlement of various income 
table of contents tax matters related to items previously reported in discontinued operations

certain amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and  have been adjusted to classify the results of the stores described above as discontinued operations 
during  we acquired million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million leaving approximately million available for share repurchases under the repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
the indenture for our senior notes contains restrictions on our ability to make share repurchases 
see further discussion under the heading financial condition 
during  million shares of our common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options resulting in proceeds of million 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates 
for detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible and long lived assets intangible and long lived assets are a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  using the purchase method of accounting 
acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of our intent to do so 
our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers 
we generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future  and  when the agreements do not have indefinite terms  anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost 
we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at june or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business 
we estimate the depreciable lives of our property  plant and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
although we believe our property  plant and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
revenue recognition revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products and sales of parts and services 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed  the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing has been arranged 
revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for i loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and ii vehicle protection products sold 
an estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the 
table of contents related revenue is recognized 
we may also participate in future profit  pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  that would be recognized over the life of the policies 
rebates  holdbacks  floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
other additionally  significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements including allowances for doubtful accounts  and for accruals related to self insurance programs  certain legal proceedings and estimated tax liabilities

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters 
however  revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events  and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions  such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentives programs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is increasing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december  and  fixed rate debt  primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes  totaled million and million  respectively  and had a fair value of million and million  respectively 
interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt when appropriate based upon market conditions 
interest rate risk at december  and  we had variable rate vehicle floorplan payable trade and vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaling billion for both years 
based on these amounts at december  and  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million  respectively  change to our annual floorplan interest expense 
our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance 
at december  and  we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling million and million  respectively 
based on the amounts outstanding at december  and  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million change to interest expense  respectively 
hedging risk we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
we have a series of interest rate hedge transactions with a notional value of million  consisting of a combination of swaps  and cap and floor options collars 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert certain floating rate vehicle floorplan payable and portions of our mortgage facilities to fixed rate debt 
we have million in swaps  which started in and effectively lock in a libor based rate of approximately  and million in collars that cap floating rates to a maximum libor based rate no greater than 
all of our hedge instruments mature between february and july at december  and  net unrealized gains losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss were million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was an additional income expense of 
million  million and 
million  respectively 
at december  and  all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income
