item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations agreements with sunoco r m and sunoco  inc for the year ended december   sunoco r m accounted for approximately percent of the partnership s total revenues 
eastern pipeline system nearly all of the eastern pipeline system is directly linked to sunoco r m s refineries 
sunoco r m constructed or acquired these assets as the most cost effective means to access raw materials and distribute refined products 
generally  pipelines are the lowest cost method for long haul  overland movement of refined products 
therefore  the most significant competitors for large volume shipments in the area served by the eastern pipeline system are other pipelines 
management of the partnership believes that high capital requirements  environmental considerations  and the difficulty in acquiring rights of way and related permits make it difficult for other companies to build competing pipelines in areas served by the partnership s pipelines 
as a result  competing pipelines are likely to be built only in those cases in which strong market demand and attractive tariff rates support additional capacity in an area 
although it is unlikely that a pipeline system comparable in size and scope to the eastern pipeline system will be built in the foreseeable future  new pipelines including pipeline segments that connect with existing pipeline systems could be built to effectively compete with it in particular locations 
in addition  the partnership  including its interests in corporate joint ventures  faces competition from trucks that deliver refined products in a number of areas that it serves 
while their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments  trucks compete effectively for incremental and marginal volume in many areas that are served 
the availability of truck transportation places a significant competitive constraint on the partnership s ability to increase tariff rates 

table of contents terminal facilities historically  except for the nederland terminal  essentially all of the throughput at the terminal facilities segment has come from sunoco r m 
under the terms of the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement and other agreements  the partnership will continue to receive a significant portion of the throughput at these facilities from sunoco r m 
the inland refined product terminals compete with other independent terminals regarding price  versatility  and services provided 
the competition primarily comes from integrated petroleum companies  refining and marketing companies  independent terminal companies  and distribution companies with marketing and trading activities 
the primary competitors for the nederland terminal are its refinery customers docks and other terminal facilities  located in the beaumont  texas area 
the inkster terminal s primary competition comes from other nearby facilities located in michigan and windsor  canada 
western pipeline system the western pipeline system faces competition from a number of major oil companies and smaller entities 
competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges and access to crude oil supply and demand 
management of the partnership believes that high capital costs make it unlikely that other companies will build new competing crude oil pipeline systems in the pipeline corridors served by the western pipeline system  however changes in refiners supply sources may negatively impact existing throughput on the western pipeline system 
crude oil purchasing and marketing competitive factors include price and contract flexibility  quantity and quality of services  and accessibility to end markets 
partnership s option to purchase pipelines from sunoco the partnership owns most of the pipeline  terminalling  storage  and related assets that support sunoco r m s refinery operations 
sunoco has retained the assets discussed below mid valley pipeline 
a subsidiary of sunoco owns a percent interest in the mid valley pipeline company a percent voting interest  which owns and operates a  mile crude oil pipeline from longview  texas to samaria  michigan 
the mid valley pipeline serves a number of refineries in the midwest united states 
inland pipeline 
a subsidiary of sunoco owns a percent interest in inland corporation  which owns and operates a mile refined products pipeline from lima and toledo  ohio to canton  cleveland  columbus  and dayton  ohio 
this pipeline transports refined products for sunoco r m from its toledo  ohio refinery and for the other owners 
sunoco has granted the partnership a ten year option  which expires in  to purchase its interest in either of the preceding assets for fair market value at the date of purchase 
sunoco s interests in these assets are subject to agreements with the other interest owners that include  among other things  consent requirements and rights of first refusal that may be triggered upon certain transfers 
the exercise of the option with respect to any of these assets is subject to the terms and conditions of those agreements 
sunoco has also granted the partnership a ten year option  which expires in  to purchase an idled mile inch refined product pipeline from icedale  pennsylvania to cleveland  ohio for fair market value at the date of purchase 

table of contents both of the ten year option agreements discussed above are contained in the omnibus agreement that was entered into with sunoco  sunoco r m and the general partner 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations agreements with sunoco r m and sunoco  inc in accordance with this agreement  if the partnership decides to exercise the option to purchase any of the assets discussed above  written notice must be provided to sunoco setting forth the fair market value the partnership proposes to pay for the asset 
if sunoco does not agree with the proposed fair market value  the partnership and sunoco will appoint a mutually agreed upon  nationally recognized investment banking firm to determine the fair market value of the asset 
once the investment bank submits its valuation of the asset  the partnership will have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the asset at the price determined by the investment banking firm 
safety regulation a majority of the partnership s pipelines are subject to united states department of transportation dot regulations under the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act of hlpsa  and to regulation under comparable state statutes relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of pipeline facilities 
in addition  the partnership must permit access to and copying of records and must prepare certain reports and provide information required by the secretary of transportation 
new dot regulations  adopted in december  require operators of hazardous liquid interstate pipelines to develop and follow a program to assess the integrity of all pipeline segments that could affect designated high consequence areas  including high population areas  drinking water and ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release  and commercially navigable waterways 
the partnership has prepared its own written risk based integrity management program  identified the line segments that could impact high consequence areas and developed baseline assessment plans 
management has completed the assessment of more than the minimum required percent highest risk line segments as of december   and expects that it will complete the full assessment of the remaining segments by march   the timeframe prescribed by the regulations 
management of the partnership believes that its pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable dot regulations and comparable state requirements 
however  an increase in expenditures may be needed in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards 
such expenditures cannot be estimated accurately at this time  but management of the partnership does not believe they would likely have a material adverse effect relative to its financial position 
employee safety the partnership is subject to the requirements of the united states federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate worker health and safety 
management believes the partnership is in substantial compliance with federal osha requirements and comparable state statutes  including general industry standards  recordkeeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to hazardous substances 
environmental regulation general the partnership s operations are subject to complex federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment  including laws and regulations which govern the handling and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials  some of which are discussed below 
violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal fines and penalties and  in some instances  injunctions banning or delaying certain activities 
management of the partnership believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 

table of contents however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change at the federal  state and local levels  and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment 
there are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with the partnership s operations  such as releases of crude oil or hazardous substances from its pipelines or storage facilities 
to the extent not insured  such accidental releases could subject the partnership to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
in connection with the february ipo  and the contribution of pipeline and terminalling assets to the partnership by affiliates of sunoco  inc  sunoco agreed to indemnify the partnership for percent of all losses from environmental liabilities related to the transferred assets arising prior to  and asserted within years of  february  there is no monetary cap on this indemnification from sunoco 
sunoco s share of liability for claims asserted thereafter will decrease by percent each year through the thirtieth year following the february  date 
any remediation liabilities not covered by this indemnity will be the partnership s responsibility 
the partnership has agreed to indemnify sunoco  inc and its affiliates for events and conditions associated with the operation of the transferred assets occurring after february   and for environmental and toxic tort liabilities related to these assets to the extent sunoco  inc is not required to indemnify the partnership 
total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon  among other things  the extent of impact at each site  the timing and nature of required remedial actions  the technology available  and the determination of the partnership s liability at multi party sites 
as of december   all material environmental liabilities incurred by  and known to  the partnership are either covered by the environmental indemnification or reserved for by the partnership within its financial statements 
air emissions the partnership s operations are subject to the clean air act  as amended  and comparable state and local statutes 
the partnership will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals addressing air emission related issues 
although no assurances can be given  management of the partnership believes implementation of the clean air act amendments will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the partnership s customers  including sunoco r m  are also subject to  and affected by  environmental regulations 
as a result of these regulations  sunoco r m could be required to make significant capital expenditures  operate these refineries at reduced levels  and pay significant penalties 
it is uncertain what sunoco  inc s or sunoco r m s responses to these emerging issues will be 
those responses could reduce sunoco r m s obligations under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement  thereby reducing the partnership s throughput in its pipelines and terminals  cash flow  and ability to make distributions or satisfy its debt obligations 
hazardous substances and waste in the course of ordinary operations  the partnership may generate waste that falls within the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act s  referred to as cercla and also known as superfund  definition of a hazardous substance and  as a result  may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment 
costs for any such remedial actions  as well as any related claims  could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses to the extent not all are covered by the indemnity from sunoco 
for more information  please see environmental remediation 

table of contents the partnership also generates solid wastes  including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act  referred to as rcra  and comparable state statutes 
the partnership is not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the rcra requirements because its operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during the partnership s operating activities  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
any changes in the regulations could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses 
the partnership currently owns or leases  and the partnership s predecessor has in the past owned or leased  properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under these laws  the partnership could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater  or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 
the partnership has not been identified by any state or federal agency as a potentially responsible party in connection with the transport and or disposal of any waste products to third party disposal sites 
water the partnership s operations can result in the discharge of regulated substances  including crude oil 
the federal water pollution control act of  also known as the clean water act  and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of regulated substances into state waters or waters of the united states 
the oil pollution act subjects owners of covered facilities to strict  joint  and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of a release of oil  where the release is into navigable waters  along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the united states 
spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state laws require diking and similar structures to help prevent the impact on navigable waters in the event of a release 
the office of pipeline safety of the dot  the epa  or various state regulatory agencies have approved the partnership s oil spill emergency response plans  and management of the partnership believes it is in substantial compliance with these laws 
in addition  some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 
management of the partnership believes that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
environmental remediation contamination resulting from releases of refined products and crude oil is not unusual within the petroleum pipeline industry 
historic releases along the partnership s pipelines  gathering systems  and terminals as a result of past operations have resulted in impacts to the environment  including soils and groundwater 
site conditions  including soils and groundwater  are being evaluated at a number of properties where operations may have resulted in releases of hydrocarbons and other wastes 
sunoco has agreed to indemnify the partnership from environmental and toxic tort liabilities related to the assets transferred to the extent such liabilities exist or arise from operation of these assets prior to the closing of the february ipo and are asserted within years after the closing of the ipo 
this indemnity will cover the costs associated with performance of the assessment  monitoring  and remediation programs  as well as any related claims and penalties 
see environmental regulation general 

table of contents the partnership has experienced several petroleum releases for which it is not covered by an indemnity from sunoco  inc  and for which it is responsible for necessary assessment  remediation  and or monitoring activities 
management of the partnership estimates that the total aggregate cost of performing the currently anticipated assessment  monitoring  and remediation activities at these sites is not material in relation to its financial position at december  the partnership has implemented an extensive inspection program to prevent releases of refined products or crude oil into the environment from its pipelines  gathering systems  and terminals 
any damages and liabilities incurred due to future environmental releases from the partnership s assets have the potential to substantially affect its business 
rate regulation general interstate regulation 
interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act  the energy policy act of  and rules and orders promulgated pursuant thereto 
the interstate commerce act requires that tariff rates for petroleum pipelines be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory 
this statute also permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and to investigate such rates 
if  upon completion of an investigation  the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful  it is authorized to require the carrier to refund revenues in excess of the prior tariff during the term of the investigation 
the ferc also may investigate  upon complaint or on its own motion  rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively 
upon an appropriate showing  a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
the ferc generally has not investigated interstate rates on its own initiative when those rates  like the partnership s  have not been the subject of a protest or a complaint by a shipper 
however  the ferc could investigate the partnership s rates at the urging of a third party if the third party is either a current shipper or has a substantial economic interest in the tariff rate level 
although no assurance can be given that the tariffs charged by the partnership ultimately will be upheld if challenged  management believes that the tariffs now in effect for the partnership s pipelines are within the maximum rates allowed under current ferc guidelines 
sunoco r m and its subsidiaries are the only current shippers on many of the pipelines 
sunoco r m has agreed not to challenge  cause others to challenge  or assist others in challenging  the tariff rates for the term of the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement 
since most of the pipelines are common carrier pipelines  the partnership may be required to accept new shippers who wish to transport on the pipelines 
it is possible that any new shippers  current shippers  or other interested parties  may decide to challenge the tariff rates 
if any rate challenge or challenges were successful  revenues  cash flows  and the cash available for distribution could be materially reduced 
the partnership has applied to ferc for permission to charge market based rates in many of the refined products markets it serves 
on january   the ferc ruled on the partnership s application for market based rates on certain of its pipelines 
market based rates were approved on the detroit  mi  pittsburgh  pa  rochester  ny and toledo  oh origin markets and the detroit  mi  philadelphia  pa and new york  ny destination markets 
ferc ordered hearings on the application for the philadelphia  pa origin market and the cleveland  oh  harrisburg  pa  scranton  pa and toledo  oh destination markets 
in those markets where market based rates were approved  the partnership would be able to establish rates without regard to the index or our cost of service 
as to the markets where hearings have been ordered  there can be no assurances that market based rates will be approved  in which case  our rates would continue to be subject to current rate structures 
intrastate regulation 
some of the partnership s pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the texas railroad commission  the pennsylvania public utility commission  the ohio public utility commission  and the oklahoma corporation commission 
the operations of the partnership s joint venture interests are also subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
the applicable state statutes require that pipeline rates be 
table of contents nondiscriminatory and provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services 
state commissions generally have not been aggressive in regulating common carrier pipelines or investigating rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 
complaints to state agencies have been infrequent and are usually resolved informally 
although management cannot be certain that the partnership s intrastate rates ultimately would be upheld if challenged  it believes that  given this history  the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged or  if challenged  are not likely to be ordered to be reduced 
title to properties substantially all of the partnership s pipelines were constructed on rights of way granted by the apparent record owners of the property and in some instances these rights of way are revocable at the election of the grantor 
several rights of way for the pipelines and other real property assets are shared with other pipelines and other assets owned by affiliates of sunoco  inc and by third parties 
in many instances  lands over which rights of way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right of way grants 
the partnership has obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under  or to lay facilities in or along  watercourses  county roads  municipal streets  and state highways and  in some instances  these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor 
the partnership has also obtained permits from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights of way  many of which are also revocable at the grantor s election 
in some cases  property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee 
in some states and under some circumstances  the partnership has the right of eminent domain to acquire rights of way and lands necessary for the common carrier pipelines 
the previous owners of the applicable pipelines may not have commenced or concluded eminent domain proceedings for some rights of way 
some of the leases  easements  rights of way  permits  and licenses acquired by the partnership or transferred to it upon the closing of the february ipo require the consent of the grantor to transfer these rights  which in some instances is a governmental entity 
the partnership has obtained or is in the process of obtaining third party consents  permits  and authorizations sufficient for the transfer of the assets necessary to operate the business in all material respects 
in management s opinion  with respect to any consents  permits  or authorizations that have not been obtained  the failure to obtain them will not have a material adverse effect on the operation of the business 
the partnership has satisfactory title to all of the assets contributed to it in connection with the february ipo  or is entitled to indemnification from sunoco  inc under the omnibus agreement for title defects to these assets and for failures to obtain certain consents and permits necessary to conduct its business that arise within ten years after the closing of the february ipo 
record title to some of the assets may continue to be held by affiliates of sunoco  inc until the partnership has made the appropriate filings in the jurisdictions in which such assets are located and obtained any consents and approvals that were not obtained prior to the closing of the february ipo 
although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases  such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property  liens for environmental contamination  taxes and other burdens  easements  or other restrictions  management believes that none of these burdens materially detract from the value of the properties or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of the partnership s business 
employees to carry out the partnership s operations  the general partner and its affiliates employed approximately  people at december  who provide direct support to the operations 
labor unions or associations represent approximately of these employees at december  the general partner considers its employee relations to be good 
the partnership has no employees

risk factors the risks below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be affected materially and adversely 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to allow us to make the required payments to our debt holders or to pay quarterly distributions 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the cash we generate from our operations 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
because the cash we generate from operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  we may not be able to pay all the applicable interest and principal obligations on our debt  or to pay quarterly distributions 
in the future  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  realize currently anticipated operating improvements or borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on or before maturity on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our ability to pay quarterly distributions depends primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses and may be unable to pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income 
our general partner s discretion in determining the level of cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
our partnership agreement provides that our general partner may reduce operating surplus by establishing cash reserves to provide funds for our future operating expenditures 
in addition  the partnership agreement provides that our general partner may reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business  to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to our unitholders in any one or more of the next four quarters 
these cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for current distribution to our unitholders 
cost reimbursements  which will be determined by our general partner in good faith  and fees due our general partner and its affiliates will be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we currently pay sunoco  inc an annual administrative fee for the provision by sunoco  inc or its affiliates of various general and administrative services for our benefit 
this fee is subject to periodic re negotiation  and 
table of contents there can be no assurance that future administrative fees charged by sunoco  inc will be at or below the current level 
this fee may increase if an expansion of our operations requires an increased level of general and administrative services from sunoco  inc or its affiliates 
if we are unable to obtain such services from sunoco  inc or third parties at or below the current cost  it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all other expenses it incurs on our behalf  including the salaries of  and the cost of employee benefits for  our general partner s employees  including senior executives  who provide services to us 
our general partner will determine the amount of these expenses in good faith 
our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions  even where the purpose or effect of the borrowing benefits the general partner or its affiliates 
in some instances  our general partner may cause us to borrow funds from affiliates of sunoco  inc or from third parties in order to permit the payment of cash distributions 
these borrowings are permitted even if the purpose and effect of the borrowing is to enable us to make a distribution on the subordinated units  to make incentive distributions  or to hasten the expiration of the subordination period 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require our unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than of the common units  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price  may not receive a return on the investment  and may incur a tax liability upon the sale 
even if unitholders are dissatisfied  they cannot remove our general partner without its consent  which could lower the trading price of the common units 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and  therefore  limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders did not elect our general partner or its board of directors and will have no right to elect our general partner or its board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
the board of directors of our general partner is chosen by the members of our general partner  all of which are subsidiaries of sunoco  inc furthermore  if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they will have little ability to remove our general partner 
as a result of these limitations  the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a control premium in the trading price 
the partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
the general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the owner of the general partner from transferring its ownership interest in the general partner to a third party 
the new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of the general partner with its own choices and to control the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers 

table of contents sunoco  inc and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities  which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of our unitholders 
sunoco  inc indirectly owns and controls our general partner  which holds the percent general partner interest and holds a percent limited partner interest in us 
conflicts of interest may arise between sunoco  inc and its affiliates  including our general partner  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  the general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations sunoco r m  as a shipper on our pipelines  and a customer at our terminals  could seek lower tariff rates or terminalling fees  once the terms of sunoco r m s obligations under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements expire in through neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires sunoco  inc to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets  including whether to increase or decrease refinery production  whether to shut down or reconfigure a refinery  or what markets to pursue or grow 
sunoco  inc s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the stockholders of sunoco  inc  our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as sunoco  inc  in resolving conflicts of interest  under our partnership agreement  our general partner has limited liability and restricted fiduciary duties with respect to actions that  without these limitations and restrictions  might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty  under our partnership agreement  the remedies available to our unitholders with respect to conduct by our general partner that may constitute a breach of fiduciary duty have been limited  our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  capital expenditures  borrowings  issuance of additional partnership securities  and reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders  our general partner determines which costs incurred by sunoco  inc and its affiliates are reimbursable by us  our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf  our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates  including the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements with sunoco r m  and our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants  or others to perform services for us 
we are a holding company 
we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries and depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to service our debt obligations 
we are a holding company 
we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flow and ability to service our debt is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries 
in addition  we are dependent on the distribution of earnings  loans or other payments from our subsidiaries to us 
any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or other payments from our subsidiaries to us could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries also will be contingent upon the profitability of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries we may not be able to pay interest or principal on our debt securities when due or to obtain the necessary funds from other sources 

table of contents we depend upon sunoco r m for a substantial portion of the crude oil and refined products transported on our pipelines and handled at our terminals  and our crude oil sales 
for the year ended december   sunoco r m accounted for approximately percent of our eastern pipeline system total revenues  percent of our terminal facilities total revenues  and percent of our western pipeline system total revenues 
the balance of our revenues was received from third parties  and we will continue to remain dependent on third parties for these additional revenues 
our pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements with sunoco r m provide for escalation of the fees charged to sunoco r m  but the increased fees may be inadequate to cover increased costs in the future 
we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sunoco r m for the foreseeable future 
if for any reason  sunoco r m were to decrease the throughput transported on our pipelines  the volumes of crude oil or refined products handled at our terminals or the amounts of crude oil purchased from us  it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
sunoco r m s obligations to us under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements and other arrangements may be reduced or suspended in some circumstances 
sunoco r m s obligations to us under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements may be permanently reduced in some circumstances 
these events  some of which are within the exclusive control of sunoco r m  include the inability of sunoco r m and us to agree on the amount of any surcharge required to be paid by sunoco r m to cover substantial and unanticipated costs that may be incurred in complying with new laws or governmental regulations applicable to our terminal facilities  a decision by sunoco r m to shut down or reconfigure one or more of its refineries if sunoco r m reasonably believes in good faith that such event will jeopardize its ability to satisfy its minimum revenue or throughput obligations  and federal or state governmental action that prohibits sunoco r m from using mtbe in the gasoline it produces if sunoco r m reasonably believes in good faith that this action will jeopardize its ability to satisfy its minimum revenue or throughput obligations 
depending on the ultimate cost of complying with existing and future environmental regulations or proceedings  sunoco r m may determine that it is more economical to reduce production at a refinery or shut down all or a portion of a refinery rather than make these capital expenditures 
sunoco r m s obligations to us under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements would be reduced in this event 
furthermore  sunoco r m s obligations to us would be temporarily suspended during the occurrence of an event that is outside the control of the parties  which renders performance impossible with respect to an asset for at least days 
the occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
sunoco  inc actively manages its assets and operations  and therefore  changes of some nature  possibly material to our business relationship  may occur at some point in the future 
if sunoco r m satisfies only its minimum obligations to us under  or if we are unable to renew or extend the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements  it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
sunoco r m may reduce the volume it transports on our pipelines or delivers at our terminals to the minimum amounts it is obligated to transport or deliver under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements 
in addition  the terms of sunoco r m s obligations to us under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements entered into at the time of our initial public offering are of relatively brief duration  
table of contents generally expiring in through if sunoco r m reduces its use of our facilities after expiration of this agreement or any other storage and throughput agreements between us and sunoco r m  or if the terms under a new agreement are materially changed in a way that reduces revenues  and we are unable to generate additional revenues from third parties  it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
a sustained decrease in demand for refined products in the markets served by our pipelines and terminals could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
factors that could lead to a sustained decrease in market demand for refined products include a recession or other adverse economic condition that results in lower purchases of refined petroleum products  higher refined product prices due to an increase in the market price of crude oil  changes in economic conditions  or other factors  higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase  directly or indirectly  the cost of gasoline or other refined products  a shift by consumers to more fuel efficient or alternative fuel vehicles or an increase in fuel economy  whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers  pending legislation proposing to mandate higher fuel economy  or otherwise  and a temporary or permanent material increase in the price of refined products as compared to alternative sources of refined products available to our customers 
when the price of foreign crude oil delivered to the united states is greater than that of domestic crude oil  or the price for the future delivery of crude oil falls below current prices  customers are less likely to store crude oil  thereby reducing storage revenues at our nederland terminal 
most of the crude oil stored at our nederland terminal is foreign crude oil 
when the price of foreign crude oil delivered to the united states is greater than that of domestic crude oil  the demand for this storage capacity may decrease 
if this market condition occurs  our storage revenues will be lower 
when the price of crude oil in a given month exceeds the price of crude oil for delivery in a subsequent month  the market is backwardated 
when the crude oil market is backwardated  the demand for storage capacity at our nederland terminal may decrease because crude oil producers can capture a premium for prompt deliveries rather than storing it for sale later 
although a backwardated market generally has a favorable impact on marketing margins because crude oil marketers can continue to purchase crude oil from producers at a fixed premium to posted prices while selling crude oil at a higher premium to such prices  we may be unable to completely offset the lower storage revenues in a backwardated market 
a material decrease in crude oil available for transport through our western pipeline system could materially and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the volume of crude oil transported in our crude oil pipelines depends on the availability of attractively priced crude oil produced in the areas accessible to our crude oil pipelines and received from other common carrier pipelines 
if we do not replace volume lost due to a material temporary or permanent decrease in supply  the volume of crude oil transported through our pipelines would decline 
in addition  sustained low crude oil prices could lead to a decline in drilling activity and production levels or the shutting in or abandonment of marginal wells 
similarly  a temporary or permanent material increase in the price of crude oil supplied from any of these sources  as compared to alternative sources of crude oil available to our customers  could cause the volume of crude oil transported in our pipelines to decline 

table of contents any reduction in the capability of  or the allocations to  our shippers in interconnecting  third party pipelines would cause a reduction of volumes transported in our pipelines and through our terminals 
sunoco r m and the other users of our pipelines and terminals are dependent upon connections to third party pipelines to receive and deliver crude oil and refined products 
any reduction of capabilities of these interconnecting pipelines due to testing  line repair  reduced operating pressures  or other causes would result in reduced volumes transported in our pipelines or through our terminals 
similarly  if additional shippers begin transporting volume over interconnecting pipelines  the allocations to our existing shippers could be reduced  which also would reduce volumes transported in our pipelines or through our terminals 
if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and or in a timely manner  or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could be affected materially and adversely 
delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving construction of new facilities or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results 
delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we make 
such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace  many of which are beyond our control  including denial or delay in issuing requisite regulatory approvals and or permits  unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor  disruptions in transportation of modular components and or construction materials  severe adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  or other events such as equipment malfunctions explosions  fires  spills affecting our facilities  or those of vendors and suppliers  shortages of sufficiently skilled labor  or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages  market related increases in a project s debt or equity financing costs  and or nonperformance by  or disputes with  vendors  suppliers  contractors  or sub contractors involved with a project 
our forecasted internal rates of return also are based upon our projections of future market fundamentals which are not within our control  including changes in general economic conditions  available alternative supply and customer demand 
potential future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may increase substantially the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities  and we may be unable to integrate them effectively into our existing operations 
from time to time  we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement or diversify our existing assets and businesses 
acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly 
acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses  inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them and new geographic areas 
further  unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition 
in some cases  we have indemnified the previous owners and operators of acquired assets 
following an acquisition  we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse 
table of contents under applicable indemnification provisions 
an acquisition may require us to assume certain prior known or unknown liabilities 
our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured 
our operations and those of our customers and suppliers may be subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions such as natural disasters including hurricanes  adverse weather  accidents  fires  explosions  hazardous materials releases  and other events beyond our control 
these events might result in a loss of equipment or life  injury  or extensive property damage  as well as an interruption in our operations 
we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount desired at reasonable rates 
in some instances  certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we are exposed to the credit and other counterparty risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately assessed the credit worthiness of our existing or future counterparties or that there will not be an unanticipated deterioration in their credit worthiness  which could have an adverse impact on us 
in those cases in which we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead  we may be responsible for distribution of proceeds to all parties 
in other cases  we pay all of or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses in dealings with other parties 
competition with respect to our operating segments could ultimately lead to lower levels of profits and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we face competition from other pipelines  terminals and crude oil marketers  as well as from other means of transporting  storing and distributing petroleum products 
our customers demand delivery of products on tight time schedules and in a number of geographic markets 
if our quality of service declines or we cannot meet the demands of our customers  they may utilize the services of our competitors 
if a competing crude oil or refined product pipeline or other crude oil marketer charged lower rates than we do  we could be forced to reduce our rates to remain competitive 
mergers among our customers and competitors could result in lower volumes being shipped on our pipelines or products stored in or distributed through our terminals  or reduced crude oil marketing margins or volumes 
mergers between existing customers could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing systems instead of ours in those markets where the systems compete 
as a result  we could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers and we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
rate regulation may not allow us to recover the full amount of increases in our costs 
a successful challenge to our rates could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the primary rate making methodology of the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  is price indexing 
we use this methodology in all of our interstate markets 
in an order issued february   the ferc announced that  effective july   the index would equal the change in the producer price index for finished goods previously  the index was equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods 
table of contents minus 
if the index falls  we would be required to reduce rates that are based on the ferc s price indexing methodology if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate 
in addition  changes in the index might not be large enough to fully reflect actual increases in our costs 
the ferc s rate making methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our true costs or may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs 
under the energy policy act adopted in  certain interstate pipeline rates were deemed just and reasonable or grandfathered 
most of our revenues are derived from grandfathered rates on our ferc regulated refined products pipelines 
a person challenging a grandfathered rate must  as a threshold matter  establish a substantial change since the date of enactment of the act  in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the service that formed the basis for the rate 
a complainant might assert that the creation of the partnership itself constitutes such a change  an argument that has not previously been specifically addressed by the ferc 
if the ferc were to find a substantial change in circumstances  then the existing rates could be subject to detailed review 
there is a risk that some rates could be found to be in excess of levels justified by our cost of service 
in such event  the ferc would order us to reduce rates prospectively and could order us to pay reparations to complaining shippers 
reparations could be required for a period of up two years prior to the date of filing the complaint in the case of rates that are not grandfathered and for the period starting with the filing of the complaint in the case of grandfathered rates 
on july   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  or the dc circuit  issued its opinion in bp west coast products  llc v 
ferc  which upheld ferc s determination that the rates of an interstate petroleum products pipeline  sfpp  lp  or sfpp  were grandfathered rates under the energy policy act of and that sfpp s shippers had not demonstrated substantially changed circumstances that would justify modification of those rates 
the court also vacated the portion of the ferc s decision applying the lakehead policy 
in the lakehead decision  the ferc allowed an oil pipeline master limited partnership to include in its cost of service an income tax allowance to the extent that its unitholders were corporations subject to income tax 
the bp west coast decision is likely to be appealed to the dc circuit  and the new tax allowance policy is subject to rehearing and further action by the ferc 
the ultimate outcome of this proceeding is not certain  and could result in changes to the ferc s treatment of income tax allowances in cost of service 
in may and june  the ferc issued a statement of general policy  as well as an order on remand of bp west coast  respectively  in which the ferc has stated it will permit pipelines to include in cost of service a tax allowance to reflect actual or potential tax liability on their public utility income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests  if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income 
whether a pipeline s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the ferc on a case by case basis 
although the new policy is generally favorable for pipelines that are organized as pass through entities  it still entails rate risk due to the case by case review requirement 
however  on december   the ferc issued its first case specific review of the income tax allowance issue in the sfpp  lp proceeding 
the ferc ruled favorably to sfpp lp on all income tax issues and set forth guidelines regarding the evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance 
in addition  a state commission could also investigate our intrastate rates or terms and conditions of service on its own initiative or at the urging of a shipper or other interested party 
if a state commission found that our rates exceeded levels justified by our cost of service  the state commission could order us to reduce our rates 
sunoco r m has agreed not to challenge  or to cause others to challenge or assist others in challenging  our tariff rates in effect during the term of the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement 
this agreement does not prevent other current or future shippers from challenging our tariff rates 
at the end of the term of the agreement  sunoco r m will be free to challenge  or to cause other parties to challenge or assist others in challenging  our tariff rates in effect at that time 
potential changes to current rate making methods and procedures may impact the federal and state regulations under which we will operate in the future 
in addition  if the ferc s petroleum pipeline ratemaking methodology changes  the new methodology could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents our operations are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational safety that could require substantial expenditures 
our pipelines  gathering systems  and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict environmental and safety laws and regulations 
the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil result in a risk that refined products  crude oil  and other hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment  potentially causing substantial expenditures for a response action  significant government penalties  liability to government agencies for natural resources damages  personal injury  or property damages to private parties and significant business interruption 
we own or lease a number of properties that have been used to store or distribute refined products and crude oil for many years 
many of these properties also have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose handling  disposal  or release of hydrocarbons and other wastes were not under our control  and for which  in some cases  we have indemnified the previous owners and operators 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and  to a lesser extent  issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 
we may be unable to recover these costs through increased revenues 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the petroleum products that we store and transport 
petroleum products that we store and transport are sold by our customers for consumption into the public market 
various federal  state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications to commodities sold into the public market 
changes in product quality specifications could reduce our throughput volume  require us to incur additional handling costs or require the expenditure of capital 
in addition  different product specifications for different markets impact the fungibility of the system and could require the construction of additional storage 
we may be unable to recover these costs through increased revenues 
restrictions in our debt agreements  and in sunoco  inc s debt agreements may prevent us from engaging in some beneficial transactions or paying distributions to unitholders 
as of december   our total outstanding long term indebtedness was approximately million  consisting of million of senior notes  net of unamortized discount of million and million of borrowings under our credit facility 
our payment of principal and interest on the debt will reduce the cash available for distribution on our units  as will our obligation to repurchase the senior notes upon the occurrence of specified events involving a change in control of our general partner 
in addition  we are prohibited by our credit facility and the senior notes from making cash distributions during an event of default  or if the payment of a distribution would cause an event of default  under any of our debt agreements 
the termination of our pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreements with sunoco r m would constitute an event of default under our credit facility 
failure to renew these agreements could lead to an event of default under our credit facility 
our leverage and various limitations in our credit facility and our senior notes may reduce our ability to incur additional debt  engage in some transactions  and capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities 
since sunoco  inc owns and controls our general partner  we are not permitted to incur additional debt if the effect would be to cause an event of default under sunoco  inc s revolving credit agreements 
any subsequent refinancing of sunoco  inc s or our current debt or any new debt could have similar or greater restrictions 

table of contents we could incur a substantial amount of debt in the future  which could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
we are permitted to incur additional debt  subject to certain limitations under our revolving credit facility and  in the case of secured debt  under the indenture governing the notes 
if we incur additional debt in the future  our increased leverage could  for example make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt securities or other indebtedness and  if we fail to comply with the requirements of the other indebtedness  could result in an event of default under our debt securities or such other indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow from working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  detract from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally  and place us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors 
rising short term interest rates could increase our financing costs and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
as of december   we had million of floating rate debt 
as a result  we have exposure to changes in short term interest rates 
rising short term rates could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
a down grading in sunoco  inc s credit rating could result in a down grading in our credit rating  which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing 
due to our relationship with sunoco  inc  our credit rating is partly dependent on sunoco  inc s credit rating 
any down grading in sunoco  inc s credit rating could result in a down grading in our credit rating  which could  among other things  limit our ability to obtain financing on the terms currently available to us  if at all 
terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business 
since the september  terrorist attacks  the us government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically the nation s pipeline and terminal infrastructure  may be the future targets of terrorist organizations 
any future terrorist attack at our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of other pipelines  refineries  or terminals could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
due to our lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in our businesses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we rely exclusively on the revenues generated from our businesses  and dividends from our equity investments 
due to our lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in one of these businesses could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets 

table of contents we may issue additional common units without unitholder approval  which would dilute our unitholders ownership interests 
during the subordination period  our general partner  without the approval of our unitholders  may cause us to issue up to  additional common units 
our general partner also may cause us to issue an unlimited number of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank with the common units  without unitholder approval  in a number of circumstances 
after the end of the subordination period  we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders 
our partnership agreement does not give our unitholders the right to approve our issuance of equity securities ranking junior to the common units at any time 
the issuance of additional common units  or other equity securities of equal or senior rank  will decrease the proportionate ownership interest of existing unitholders and may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution and or the market price of our common units 
sunoco  inc and its affiliates may engage in limited competition with us 
sunoco  inc and its affiliates may engage in limited competition with us 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement  sunoco  inc and its affiliates have agreed not to engage in the business of purchasing crude oil at the wellhead or operating refined product or crude oil pipelines or terminals or lpg terminals in the continental united states 
the omnibus agreement  however  does not apply to any business operated by sunoco  inc or any of its subsidiaries at the closing of our initial public offering  any logistics asset constructed by sunoco  inc or any of its subsidiaries within a manufacturing or refining facility in connection with the operation of that facility  any business that sunoco  inc or any of its subsidiaries acquires or constructs that has a fair market value of less than million  and any business that sunoco  inc or any of its subsidiaries acquires or constructs that has a fair market value of million or more if we have been offered the opportunity to purchase the business for fair market value  and we decline to do so with the concurrence of our conflicts committee 
upon a change of control of sunoco  inc or a sale of the general partner by sunoco  inc  the non competition provisions of the omnibus agreement may terminate 
a unitholder may not have limited liability if a state or federal court finds that we are not in compliance with the applicable statutes or that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states 
a unitholder could be held liable in some circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a state or federal court determined that we had been conducting business in any state without complying with the applicable limited partnership statute  or the right or the exercise of the right by the unitholders as a group to remove or replace our general partner  to approve some amendments to the partnership agreement  or to take other action under the partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business 
under applicable state law  our general partner has unlimited liability for our obligations  including our debts and environmental liabilities  if any  except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
in addition  section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act provides that under some circumstances a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution 

table of contents our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service  or irs  treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs on this matter 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the ones we take 
a successful irs contest of the federal income tax positions we take may impact adversely the market for our common units  and the costs of any irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax at the corporate tax rate  and likely would pay state income tax at varying rates 
distributions to unitholders generally would be taxed again as corporate distributions 
treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in anticipated cash flow and after tax return to unitholders 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or to otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise and other forms of taxation 
if any of these states were to impose a tax on us  the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state  or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us

item properties see item c for a description of the locations and general character of the partnership s material properties 
item legal proceedings there are certain legal and administrative proceedings arising prior to the february ipo pending against the partnership s sunoco affiliated predecessors and the partnership as successor to certain liabilities of those predecessors 
although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time  it is reasonably possible that some of them may be resolved unfavorably 
sunoco has agreed to indemnify the partnership for percent of all losses from environmental liabilities related to the transferred assets arising prior to  and asserted within years of february  there is no monetary cap on this indemnification from sunoco 
sunoco s share of liability for claims asserted thereafter will decrease by percent each year through the thirtieth year following the february  date 
any remediation liabilities not covered by this indemnity will be the partnership s responsibility 
there are certain other pending legal proceedings related to matters arising after the february ipo that are not indemnified by sunoco  inc management believes that any liabilities that may arise from these legal proceedings will not be material to the partnership s financial position at december  item submission of matters to a vote of securityholders no matters were submitted to a vote of the securityholders during fiscal 
table of contents part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related securityholder matters and purchases of equity securities the partnership s common units were listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol sxl beginning on february  prior to february   the partnership s equity securities were not traded on any public trading market 
at the close of business on february   there were holders of record of the partnership s common units 
these holders of record included the general partner with  common units registered in its name  and cede co 
with  common units registered to it 
the high and low closing sales price ranges composite transactions and distributions declared by quarter for and were as follows unit price declared distributions unit price declared distributions quarter high low high low st nd rd th distributions were declared and paid within days following the close of each quarter 
within days after the end of each quarter  the partnership distributes all cash on hand at the end of the quarter less reserves established by the general partner in its discretion 
this is defined as available cash in the partnership agreement 
the general partner has broad discretion to establish cash reserves that it determines are necessary or appropriate to properly conduct the partnership s business 
the partnership will make minimum quarterly distributions of per common unit  to the extent there is sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to the general partner 
the partnership also had  subordinated units issued as of december   all of which were held by the general partner  and for which there is no established public trading market 
the partnership issued  subordinated units to its general partner in connection with the ipo 
the subordination period is generally defined as the period that ends on the first day of any quarter beginning after december  if the partnership has distributed at least the minimum quarterly distribution on all outstanding units with respect to each of the immediately preceding three consecutive  non overlapping four quarter periods  and the adjusted operating surplus  as defined in the partnership agreement  during such periods equals or exceeds the amount that would have been sufficient to enable the partnership to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution on all outstanding units on a fully diluted basis and the related distribution on the percent general partner interest during those periods 
in addition  one quarter of the subordinated units may convert to common units on a one for one basis after both december  and december   if the partnership meets the required tests for the preceding three consecutive  non overlapping four quarter periods 
when the subordination period ends  the rights of the holders of subordinated units will no longer be subordinated to the rights of the holders of common units and the subordinated units may be converted into common units 
during the subordination period  the partnership will generally pay cash distributions each quarter in the following manner first  percent to the holders of common units and percent to the general partner  until each common unit has received a minimum quarterly distribution of  plus any arrearages from prior quarters  
table of contents second  percent to the holders of subordinated units and percent to the general partner  until each subordinated unit has received a minimum quarterly distribution of  and thereafter  in the manner discussed below 
the partnership has met the minimum quarterly distribution requirements on all outstanding units for each of the four quarter periods ended december   and as a result  a total of  subordinated units have been converted into common units on a one for one basis   each on february  and february  as a result  there are  subordinated units outstanding at february   all of which may be converted in february as long as the partnership continues to meet the financial tests noted above for each of the four quarter periods ending december   and after the subordination period  the partnership will  in general  pay cash distributions each quarter in the following manner quarterly cash distribution amount per unit percentage of distributions unitholders general partner up to minimum quarterly distribution per unit above per unit up to per unit above per unit up to per unit above per unit up to per unit above per unit if cash distributions exceed per unit in a quarter  the general partner will receive increasing percentages  up to percent  of the cash distributed in excess of that amount 
these distributions are referred to as incentive distributions 
the amounts shown in the table under percentage of distributions are the percentage interests of the general partner and the unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus that is distributed up to and including the corresponding amount in the column quarterly cash distribution amount per unit  until the available cash that is distributed reaches the next target distribution level  if any 
the percentage interests shown for the unitholders and the general partner for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution 
there is no guarantee that the partnership will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units in any quarter  and the partnership is prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default  or an event of default is existing  under the credit facility or the senior notes please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

item selected financial data on february   the partnership completed an ipo and related transactions whereby it became the successor to sunoco logistics predecessor  which consisted of a substantial portion of the wholly owned logistics operations of sunoco  inc and its subsidiaries 
the selected financial and operating data presented is derived from the audited financial statements of sunoco logistics partners lp  which reflect the predecessor for  the partnership and predecessor for  and the partnership for  and for the periods presented  sunoco r m was the primary or exclusive user of the refined product terminals  the fort mifflin terminal complex  and the marcus hook tank farm 
prior to january   most of the terminalling and throughput services provided by the predecessor for sunoco r m s refining and marketing 
table of contents operations were at fees that enabled the recovery of costs  but not to generate any operating income 
accordingly  historical earnings before interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization expense ebitda for those assets was equal to their depreciation and amortization expense 
sunoco logistics partners lp began charging sunoco r m fees for these services that are comparable to those charged in arm s length  third party transactions  generally effective january   using the terms included in a pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement entered into at the closing of the ipo 
maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and to extend their useful lives 
expansion capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to expand the existing operating capacity of the assets  whether through construction or acquisition 
the partnership treats repair and maintenance expenditures that do not extend the useful life of existing assets as operating expenses as incurred 
throughput is the total number of barrels per day bpd transported on a pipeline system or through a terminal 
total shipments represent the total average daily pipeline throughput multiplied by the number of miles of pipeline through which each barrel has been shipped 
management of the partnership believes that total shipments is a better performance indicator for the eastern pipeline system than throughput as certain refined product pipelines such as transfer pipelines  transport large volumes over short distances and generate minimal revenues 
the following table should be read together with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the financial statements and the accompanying notes of sunoco logistics partners lp included in
