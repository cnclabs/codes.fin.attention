item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
the fixed nature of these costs makes attendance a key factor in the profitability of each park 
results of operations include geauga lake since its acquisition in april of the table below presents certain financial data expressed as a percent of total net revenues and selective statistical information for the periods indicated

for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income the most comparable financial measure  see note in item  selected financial data  on page critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates and assumptions  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to similar businesses 
property and equipment buildings  rides and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis over each park s operating season 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
the composite method of depreciation is used for assets obtained together in an acquisition of a business 
under this method  groups of related assets are depreciated over composite average lives as a whole rather than individually 
this method is used in acquisitions because it is very difficult to accurately estimate the remaining useful lives of individual assets that have been acquired  installed and maintained by others over varying time periods 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
these estimates are established based upon historical claims data and third party estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
these reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in these factors and adjustments are made as needed 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted at the end of each seasonal period 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina dockage revenues 
results of operations vs 
consolidated net revenues in increased  or million  to million 
the increase in net revenues was the result of a increase in combined attendance across our properties to million from million in  a increase in average in park guest per capita spending to from in  and a  or million  increase in out of park revenues 
although combined attendance increased only  or approximately  visits  in park revenues increased approximately million on the strength of improved average in park guest per capita spending 
the increase in out of park revenues was due to the first full year performance of the castaway bay indoor waterpark resort  as well as improved results at our knott s berry farm resort hotel and the introduction of a new tgi friday s restaurant at knott s in july of the increase in attendance in was led by strong performances from dorney park and michigan s adventure  both of which introduced successful new attractions this season  and our two midwest water parks  which benefited from a hot  dry summer 
these gains helped offset attendance shortfalls at our cedar point  valleyfair and worlds of fun amusement parks 
for the year  combined attendance at our seven amusement parks was unchanged at million guests  and attendance at our five water parks totaled million guests  up between years 
the increase in our average in park guest per capita spending level in was principally due to increased admission revenues at our amusement parks 
excluding depreciation and all other non cash charges  total operating costs and expenses in increased  or million  to million from million in this was primarily due to the additional operating costs and expenses of geauga lake  which was acquired in april  and the incremental operating costs of castaway bay  which opened in november as a percent of revenues  operating costs decreased between years 
after depreciation and a million non cash charge for unit options  operating income in increased to million from million a year ago 
this increase is primarily attributable to the strong results at knott s berry farm and dorney park 
because we strongly emphasize generating cash flow for distributions to our unitholders  a meaningful measure of our operating results is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and other non cash charges and credits for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  see note in item  selected financial data  on page 
in  adjusted ebitda increased  or million  to million  in large part due to improved operating results at knott s berry farm 
increased attendance and strong operating results at dorney park and michigan s adventure also contributed nicely 
our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin in increased to from in  with adjusted ebitda margins improving at all of our parks due to a continued focus on controlling operating costs and expenses 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge related to the change in fair value of two of our interest rate swap agreements that could not be designated as effective hedges under the applicable accounting rules 
this amount reversed into income over the life of the swaps as they continued to serve the purpose of leveling cash interest costs 
in  we recognized a non cash credit of  for the change in fair value of the swaps as they expired in the first quarter 
this compared to a non cash credit of million in these amounts are aggregated with interest expense in the accompanying table 
after non cash credits  interest expense and provision for taxes  net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared to net income of million  or per unit  a year ago 
reflected in the provision for taxes is the reversal of million of contingent liabilities recorded in prior years related to publicly traded partnership ptp taxes 
the accrual was established when the ptp taxes first came into effect  because we could not be certain at that time how the taxes would be applied 
now after a number of years of filing returns  we have a fair amount of evidence as to how the taxes are imposed  including the completion of examinations of our tax filings 
based on this evidence  we determined that the prior years accruals were no longer required and have reversed the million of contingent liabilities back into income in the adjustment to the ptp tax accrual  which was offset somewhat by ptp taxes payable for the year and the impact of the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries  resulted in a net tax benefit of million in it is important to note that since this is a reversal of a previously recorded accrual  it has no affect on our cash flow in the current period 
excluding the impact of reversing the ptp tax accrual and computing a accrual consistent with the treatment applied in  net income for the year would have been million  or per diluted limited partner unit  up million  or  from vs 
net revenues in increased  or million  to million 
the increase in net revenues was the result of a increase in combined attendance across our properties to million from million in  a increase in average in park guest per capita spending to from in  and a increase in out of park revenues 
the increase in out of park revenues was primarily driven by improvement in occupancy levels at our resort hotels at cedar point 
excluding results from the acquisition of geauga lake  net revenues in would have increased  or million  on a decrease in combined attendance  a increase in average in park guest per capita spending  and a increase in out of park revenues 
in  the addition of geauga lake  along with a strong year at knott s berry farm  offset soft attendance numbers at some of our seasonal amusement parks resulting from inconsistent weather during the peak summer months and a moderate capital program 
good weather  together with favorable tourism and pricing trends in the southern california market  contributed to knott s strong performance 
for the year  combined attendance at our seven amusement parks totaled million guests  up from excluding the impact of geauga lake  combined attendance at our amusement parks would have decreased to million 
at our five water parks  the comparisons entering were very difficult following record performances at several of the parks in for the full year  combined attendance at our five water parks totaled million guests  down from  with the majority of that decrease coming at oceans of fun in kansas city  where temperatures stayed well below average al l summer long 
the increase in our average in park guest per capita spending level in was due to solid improvements in guest spending on admissions and foods  as well as a shift in the mix of attendance away from lower per capita parks  such as our water parks 
excluding depreciation and all other non cash charges  total operating costs and expenses in increased  or million  to million from million in this increase was largely due to the acquisition of geauga lake 
excluding operations at geauga lake  total cash operating costs and expenses for would have increased only  or million  from  and all operating costs as a percent of revenues remained relatively level between years 
in  adjusted ebitda decreased  or million  to million  due entirely to an adjusted ebitda loss of million generated at geauga lake during the period subsequent to its acquisition for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  see note in item  selected financial data  on page 
excluding the impact of geauga lake  adjusted ebitda would have increased  or million  to million in  due primarily to increases in average in park guest per capita spending and out of park revenues 
our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin in decreased to from in  due almost entirely to the impact of geauga lake s operations and its adjusted ebitda loss of million 
excluding geauga lake  our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin remained relatively comparable between years at 
in  we began accounting for unit options using the fair value method under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge for unit options  compared to a charge of million in in  we recognized a non cash credit of million for the change in fair value during the year of the two interest rate swap agreements that could not be designated as effective hedges  which compared to a non cash credit of million in these amounts are aggregated with interest expense in the accompanying table 
after these non cash items  and interest expense and provision for partnership taxes  both of which were up between years due to the geauga lake acquisition  net income for decreased million to million  or per diluted limited partner unit  from million  or per unit  in liquidity and capital resources we ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  is the result of our highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow to reduce borrowings 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase reflects an increase in operating profit of million between years  offset by changes in working capital and higher cash interest payments 
in  net cash from operating activities increased million  or  from the previous year 
this increase was primarily due to normal fluctuations in current liabilities and accrued taxes  offset by a decrease in net income of million 
the acquisition of geauga lake  combined with the timing of payments of liabilities  contributed to the increase in current liabilities and accrued taxes 
investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our amusement parks and resort properties 
during  net cash used for investing activities totaled million  compared to million in  which included million for the acquisition of geauga lake 
excluding the acquisition of geauga lake  capital expenditures remained comparable between years 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in our parks and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain consistently high attendance levels  as well as generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
for the operating season  we are investing approximately million in capital improvements at our properties  including the addition of a new world class roller coaster at worlds of fun and new thrill rides at both cedar point and valleyfair 
the program will also include a new wave pool at dorney park  completion of the second phase of the geauga lake water park  and the addition of a river rafting ride at michigan s adventure 
michigan s adventure will also introduce coasters  a classic s style diner that has proven very popular at several of our other parks 
in addition to adding great new thrill rides  we are also lowering a number of admission prices for the season at both cedar point and knott s berry farm 
this is a bold step and a first for both parks  but we feel it is the right response to the difficult economic conditions that exist in northern ohio and southeast michigan  two of cedar point s major markets  as well as the increased competition that knott s berry farm faces in southern california 
our goal is to make cedar point and knott s berry farm more affordable to more families and introduce the parks to those who have not had the chance to experience all we have to offer 
we believe the combination of our capital programs  our new value pricing at cedar point and knott s berry farm  and continued focus on guest service  all communicated through an exciting marketing program  will improve attendance and operating results company wide in however  stable population trends in the parks market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance 
financing activities net cash utilized for financing activities totaled million in  compared to net cash provided from financing activities of million in and net cash utilized of million in the million of net cash provided from financing activities in reflects the issuance of million of senior notes and the completion of an equity offering that generated net proceeds of million  both related to the acquisition of geauga lake 
excluding these items  net cash utilized for financing activities in would have totaled million 
in  we had a net cash receipt of million related to the early termination of in the money interest rate swap agreements and million from option exercises 
in addition  net revolving credit borrowings totaled million in cash used in financing activities during reflects million for scheduled term loan repayments and million to pay cash distributions 
capital resources at december   we had million of fixed rate term debt  with staggered maturities ranging from to  as well as a million revolving credit facility  which is available through march borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million as of december  of the total term debt  million is scheduled to mature in based on interest rates in effect at year end for variable rate debt  cash interest payments for would total approximately million  slightly higher than interest paid in due to continued increases in short term rates 
in addition  cash distributions in  at the current rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in we are in the process of negotiating an agreement with our bank group and expect to have a new million year revolving credit facility in place by the end of the first quarter of we expect the new credit facility will carry somewhat lower overall rates than the previous credit facility  but we do not expect the impact on interest expense to be material 
total credit facilities and cash flows from operations are expected to be adequate to fund seasonal working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly distributions to partners for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital expenditures total represents maturities on long term debt obligations  plus contractual interest payments on all fixed rate debt 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
represents contractual obligations in place at year end for the purchase of new rides and attractions 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and  from time to time  currency exchange rates on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
at december   million of our outstanding long term debt represented fixed rate debt and million represented variable rate debt 
assuming an average annual balance on our revolving credit borrowings  the cash flow impact of a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt would be approximately million as of december  impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could possibly not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates  which although not tied directly to federal and state minimum wage laws  do follow those wage trends 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
