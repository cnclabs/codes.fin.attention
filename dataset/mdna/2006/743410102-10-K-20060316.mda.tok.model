item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements in item operating segments property operations the property operations segment represents the direct long term ownership  management and leasing of industrial distribution and retail properties 
our investment strategy in the property operations segment focuses primarily on the ownership and leasing of generic industrial distribution and retail properties in key distribution markets 
investments at december   our property operations segment consisted of  operating properties aggregating million square feet in north america  europe and asia 
of the total   properties aggregating million square feet were industrial distribution properties and were retail properties aggregating million square feet  all in north america 
included in this segment at december  were operating properties aggregating million square feet at a total investment of billion that 
table of contents were developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment but are included in the property operations segment s assets pending contribution or sale 
during  we increased our investments in our property operations segment through the following activities in connection with the catellus merger  we added industrial distribution properties aggregating million square feet  representing an investment of billion and all of our retail properties aggregating million square feet representing an investment of million 
we acquired industrial distribution properties  aggregating million square feet representing an investment of million  through various individual and or portfolio acquisitions 
we offset the increases in our investments by the disposition of properties aggregating million square feet and an investment of million at the time of disposition 
these dispositions include properties in three markets we strategically decided to exit during kansas city  oklahoma city and tulsa 
on a continuing basis  we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition and or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties 
results of operations we earn rent from our customers under long term operating leases  including reimbursements of certain operating costs  in our industrial distribution and retail properties that we own directly in north america  europe and asia 
we expect to grow our revenue through increases in properties owned and increases in occupancy rates and in rental rates in both our industrial distribution and retail properties 
our strategy is to achieve these increases primarily through the acquisition of industrial distribution properties  continued focus on our customers global needs for distribution space in the three continents in which we operate  and use of the prologis operating system 
market presence at december   the  properties aggregating million square feet in the property operations segment were located in markets in north america markets in the united states and three markets in mexico  markets in eight countries in europe and four markets in three countries in asia 
our largest markets for the property operations segment in north america based on investment in the properties are atlanta  chicago  dallas fort worth  los angeles orange county  new jersey and san francisco east and south bay 
our largest investment in the property operations segment in europe is in the united kingdom 
direct owned properties in europe and asia primarily consist of properties that were developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment that are pending contribution or sale 
see operating segments cdfs business and item properties 
competition in general  numerous other real estate properties are located in close proximity to our properties 
the amount of rentable distribution and retail space available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge 
in addition  in many of our submarkets  institutional investors and owners and developers of properties including other reits compete for the acquisition  development and leasing of space 
many of these entities have substantial resources and experience 
competition in acquiring existing properties and land  both from institutional capital sources and from other reits  has been very strong over the past several years 
property management our business strategy includes a customer service focus that enables us to provide responsive  professional and effective property management services at the local level 
to enhance our management 
table of contents services  we have developed and implemented proprietary operating and training systems to achieve consistent levels of performance and professionalism in all markets and to enable our property management team members to give the proper level of attention to our customers throughout our network 
we manage substantially all of our direct owned operating properties  other than the retail properties 
customers we have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international  national  regional and local distribution space users 
at december   we had  customers occupying million square feet of distribution and retail space 
our largest customer and largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of our annualized collected base rents at december  employees we employ approximately  persons 
our employees work in north america approximately persons  in countries in europe approximately persons and in four countries in asia approximately persons 
of the total  approximately employees are assigned to the property operations segment 
we have approximately employees who work in corporate positions and are not assigned to a segment who may assist with property operations segment activities 
we believe our relationships with our employees are good  and our employees are not generally represented by collective bargaining agreements 
future plans our current business plan allows for the expansion of our network of operating properties as necessary to i address the specific expansion needs of customers  ii initiate or enhance our market presence in a specific country  market or submarket  iii take advantage of opportunities where we believe we have the ability to achieve favorable returns  or iv expand our direct owned business  which may include retail properties 
we intend to fund our investment activities in the property operations segment in primarily with operating cash flow from this segment  our credit facilities  additional debt and equity financing and the proceeds from contributions and dispositions of properties 
operating segments fund management the fund management segment represents the long term investment management of unconsolidated property funds  and the properties they own  with the objective of generating a high level of returns to us and our fund partners 
along with the income recognized under the equity method from our investments in the property funds  we include fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of the property funds primarily property management and asset management services and interest earned on advances to the property funds  if any  in this segment 
we utilize our leasing and property management expertise to efficiently manage the properties and the funds 
the costs of the property management function for both our direct owned portfolio and the properties owned by the property funds are all reported in the property operations segment and the costs of the fund management function are included in general and administrative expenses 
our property fund strategy allows us  as the manager of the property funds  to maintain the market presence and customer relationships that are the key drivers of the prologis operating system  allows us to realize a portion of the development profits from our cdfs business activities by contributing our stabilized development properties to property funds profits are recognized to the extent of third party investment in the property fund  
table of contents provides diversified sources of capital  allows us to earn fees and incentives for providing services to the property funds  and allows us to maintain a long term ownership position in the properties 
investments as of december  we had investments in and advances to property funds in north america  one in europe and one in japan totaling million with ownership interests ranging from to 
these investments are in north america million  europe million  and japan million 
these property funds own  on a combined basis  industrial distribution properties aggregating million square feet with a total entity investment not our proportionate share in operating properties of billion 
we act as manager of each property fund 
during and early  we had the following investment activities in september  we purchased the remaining ownership interest in prologis north american properties fund xii  one of the property funds that we acquired in  adding the properties to our property operations segment 
during  we contributed properties aggregating million square feet to the property funds 
on a combined basis  the property funds acquired properties from third parties  aggregating million square feet 
we formed the prologis japan properties fund ii  which had no investments at december  in february  we finalized and announced the creation of a new property fund  the north american industrial fund  with several institutional investors  which will primarily own recently developed industrial distribution properties in major distribution markets throughout the united states and canada 
on january   we purchased the remaining ownership interests in each of prologis north american properties funds ii  iii and iv from our fund partner  an affiliate of arcapita bank bsc c arcapita and in march  we contributed substantially all of the assets and associated liabilities we obtained in this acquisition to the north american industrial fund 
results of operations we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated property funds operating in north america  europe and asia 
along with the income recognized under the equity method  we include fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of the property funds primarily property management and asset management services and interest earned on advances to the property funds  if any 
we also earn certain other fees for services provided to the property funds  such as acquisition  financing and development fees 
we expect growth in income recognized to come from newly created property funds  as discussed below  and growth in existing property funds 
the growth in the existing property funds is expected to come primarily from additional properties the funds will acquire  generally from us  and increased rental revenues in the property funds due  in part  to our leasing and property management efforts from our property operations segment 
market presence at december   the property funds on a combined basis owned properties aggregating million square feet located in markets in north america the united states and mexico  markets in countries in europe and three markets in asia japan 

table of contents competition as the manager of the property funds  we compete with other fund managers for institutional capital throughout the capital markets 
in general  numerous other real estate properties are located in close proximity to the properties owned by the property funds 
the amount of rentable distribution space available in any market could have a material effect on the funds ability to rent space and on the rents that they can charge 
property management we manage the property funds and all the properties they own in our property operations segment utilizing our leasing and property management experience and the prologis operating system 
our business strategy includes a customer service focus that enables us to provide responsive  professional and effective property management services at the local level 
to enhance our management services  we have developed and implemented proprietary operating and training systems to achieve consistent levels of performance and professionalism in all markets and to enable our property management team members to give the proper level of attention to our customers throughout our network 
customers we have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international  national  regional and local distribution space users in both our direct owned properties and those properties we manage on behalf of the property funds 
at december   the property funds  on a combined basis  had  customers occupying million square feet of distribution space 
the largest customer and largest customers  all on a combined basis  accounted for and  respectively  of the total combined annualized collected base rents at december  employees we have approximately employees who work in corporate positions assigned to the fund management segment 
in addition  employees in our property operations segment are responsible for the management of the properties owned by the property funds 
our other corporate employees may assist with fund management segment activities as well 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good  and our employees are generally not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
future plans we expect to continue to increase our investments in the property funds 
we expect to achieve these increases through the existing property funds acquisition of properties that have been developed or acquired by us in the cdfs business segment  as well as from third parties 
we also expect growth from newly formed property funds  like the prologis japan properties fund ii and the north american industrial fund formed in late and early  as discussed earlier 
we expect the fee and incentive income we earn from the property funds and our proportionate share of net earnings of the property funds will both increase in over as the portfolios owned by the property funds increase 
operating segments cdfs business our cdfs business segment primarily encompasses our development of properties that generally are either contributed to a property fund or sold to third parties 
additionally  we acquire properties with the intent to rehabilitate and or reposition the property in the cdfs business segment prior to being contributed to a property fund 
we engage in commercial mixed use development activities generally with the intention of selling the land or completed projects to third parties 

table of contents investments at december   we had distribution properties aggregating million square feet under development with a total expected cost at completion of billion 
our properties under development at december  include north america properties in canada  mexico and the united states  for a combined total of million square feet  with a total expected cost of million approximately of the total  europe properties in six countries  for a combined total of million square feet  with a total expected cost of million approximately of the total  and asia properties in china and japan  for a combined total of million square feet  with a total expected cost of million approximately of the total 
in addition  at december   we had industrial distribution properties aggregating million square feet with a current investment of billion that we had previously developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment 
these properties and their results of operations are currently included in the property operations segment pending contribution or sale 
this brings our total pipeline of direct owned potential cdfs business disposition properties to billion at december  in addition to the properties under development and completed properties that we own directly  unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have a weighted ownership interest had eight industrial distribution properties under development in the united states and china aggregating million square feet at a total expected cost at completion of million 
at december   we had land positions  including land owned by the cdfs joint ventures and land controlled through contracts or options  aggregating  acres for future development of industrial distribution properties or other commercial development 
of these land positions  we directly owned  acres with a total investment of billion 
during  we had investment activity in the cdfs business segment as follows we started the development of properties aggregating million square feet with a total expected cost at completion of billion 
these projects were either completed during or are under development at december   as discussed above 
we completed the development of properties aggregating million square feet at a total cost of billion 
these projects were either under development at december  or development began in we contributed or disposed of properties aggregating million square feet that were developed or acquired by us in the cdfs business segment 
these transactions generated net proceeds of billion 
through the catellus merger we acquired i  acres of land for future development of industrial distribution properties  retail properties and other mixed use developments  ii several development projects with a total expected investment of million that were under construction  iii investments in several cdfs joint ventures  and iv million of notes receivable related to previous asset sales 
we acquired  acres of land for future development through other individual acquisitions 
we disposed of acres of land parcels that no longer fit our development plans for total proceeds of million 
results of operations the operating income of the cdfs business segment consists primarily of the net gains recognized from the contributions of developed and repositioned properties to property funds and dispositions to third 
table of contents parties 
we use our development and leasing expertise to rehabilitate and or reposition certain of the properties that we acquire such that the subsequent contribution of the property is expected to generate a profit 
additionally  we i earn fees for development activities provided on behalf of customers or third parties  ii recognize interest income on notes receivable related to previous asset dispositions  iii recognize gains or losses on the disposition of land parcels when our development plans no longer include these parcels and iv recognize our proportionate share of the earnings or losses of cdfs joint ventures 
market presence our cdfs business segment operates in substantially all of the markets of our property operations segment 
at december   we had properties under development in markets in north america markets in the united states  two markets in mexico and one in canada  in markets in six countries in europe and in six markets in two countries in asia 
at december   the land positions owned by us were located in markets in north america markets in the united states  three markets in mexico and one in canada  markets in countries in europe and five markets in two countries in asia 
competition we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors  as we believe we are the only owner of distribution properties and provider of services with significant global operations and holdings in many key global distribution markets that allow us to operate on a consistent basis in these global markets 
north america there are a number of other national  regional and local developers engaged in the industrial distribution property development markets where we conduct business 
we compete with these developers for land acquisition and development opportunities 
the market in north america is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments  access to capital and interest rate levels 
a key component of our success in the cdfs business segment in north america will continue to be our ability to develop and timely lease properties that will generate profits when contributed or sold and our ability to continue to access capital that allows for the continued acquisition of our properties by the property funds 
we believe the catellus merger strengthened our development position in north america due to the land acquired for future development of industrial distribution properties as well as other development opportunities 
we believe the formation of the north american industrial fund  which was finalized and announced in early demonstrates our ability to access capital to allow for the future acquisition of our properties 
europe our competition in the cdfs business segment in europe primarily comes from local and regional developers in our target markets as opposed to pan european real estate companies 
as in north america  the market in europe is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments  access to capital and interest rate levels 
with respect to our development activities in europe  we believe that we have additional competitive advantages due to the strategic locations of our land positions owned or under control in europe and due to our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process 
asia our competition in the cdfs business segment in asia comes primarily from local and regional developers as opposed to real estate companies operating in several countries 
we believe that we have additional competitive advantages over the local development companies in asia due to our global experience in the development of distribution properties  our relationships with key customers established by our local personnel and our global customer base 
we believe the formation of the prologis japan properties fund ii in late demonstrates our ability to access capital to allow for the future acquisition of our properties 
customers we use the customer relationships that we have developed through our property operations segment activities and the prologis operating system in marketing our cdfs business 
in  approximately 
table of contents of the leased distribution space in our cdfs business segment properties was leased to repeat customers 
employees we employ approximately employees that are assigned to the cdfs business segment 
our other employees may assist with cdfs business segment activities 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good and our employees are generally not represented by collective bargaining agreements 
seasonal nature of the business the demand for the properties that are developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment is not seasonal in nature 
however  development activities may be impeded by weather in certain markets  particularly during the winter months  affecting the scheduling of development activities and potentially delaying construction starts and completions 
future plans we intend to continue to conduct the business of the cdfs business segment substantially as we have in the past 
we expect to increase our development activities due  in part  to the land positions and opportunities acquired in the catellus merger through both direct owned development and investments in cdfs joint ventures 
to be successful in the cdfs business segment  we believe we must be able to i develop  acquire and rehabilitate or reposition and lease properties on a timely basis and ii have access to capital available to acquire cdfs business properties 
with respect to the first requirement for success  we have demonstrated that we have the ability to develop and acquire properties that can be contributed or disposed of to generate profits 
the ability to lease our properties is dependent on customer demand 
properties contributed to property funds must generally meet specified leasing criteria 
we experienced stronger leasing activity in than in we expect some improvement in leasing in based on our expectations for economic conditions in our target markets 
our market research and customer feedback indicate that consolidation and reconfiguration of supply chains driven by the need for distribution space users to add efficiencies within their distribution networks will continue to favorably impact the demand for distribution properties and the distribution related services that we plan to offer in the cdfs business segment in also  the limited supply of state of the art distribution space in europe and asia and our position of being a single source provider of distribution space could also provide opportunities within this operating segment 
we believe that we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors by providing high quality customer service that can partially mitigate the impact of declines in market leasing activities over time 
for the past two years  approximately of the leased distribution space in our cdfs business segment properties was leased to repeat customers 
we intend to utilize the capital generated through the contributions and sales of properties  the proceeds from private or public debt and equity issuances and our credit facilities to fund our future cdfs business activities 
further  we intend to actively pursue other sources of committed capital to form new property funds that will acquire our cdfs business properties not subject to exclusivity as noted below  such as the new property funds formed and announced in and early  as discussed earlier see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item 
we are committed to offer to contribute substantially all of our stabilized industrial development properties in canada and the united states to the north american industrial fund 
the north american industrial fund has equity commitments aggregating approximately billion  which expire in february we are committed to offer to contribute all of our stabilized development properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund as long as the fund has capital to invest 
prologis european properties fund has equity commitments from nine investors through subscription agreements aggregating million the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  of which million the currency equivalent of approximately million at 
table of contents december  was unfunded at december  in addition  we were committed to make additional equity contributions of million the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  
the subscription agreements expire on august  we are committed to offer to contribute all of our stabilized development properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund ii through august prologis japan properties fund ii has equity commitments aggregating million  including commitments of million from us  which expire in august these property funds are committed to acquire such properties  subject to certain exceptions  including that the properties meet certain specified leasing and other criteria  and that the property funds have available capital 
we believe that  while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds may be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments  each property fund will have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that we expect to have available during should the property funds choose not to acquire  or not have sufficient capital available to acquire  a property that meets the specified criteria  the rights under the agreement with regard to that specific property will terminate 
there can be no assurance that if these property funds do not continue to acquire the properties that we have available  that we will be able to secure other sources of capital such that we can contribute or sell these properties in a timely manner and continue to generate profits from our development activities in a particular reporting period 
other we have other segments that do not meet the threshold criteria to disclose as a reportable segment 
these operations include i management of land subject to ground leases  ii office property operations  and iii the ownership of or investment in hotel properties 
each operating property and activity is located in the united states and is considered to be an individual operating segment 
these segments were added through the catellus merger 
our long term investment objectives do not include investments in the office or hotel sectors 
consequently  we expect to dispose of these properties as market conditions and other business considerations allow and  therefore  we do not expect much growth in these segments

these individuals are designated as executive officers under item of regulation s k 
environmental matters a majority of the properties acquired by us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners 
while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling  none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item insurance coverage we carry comprehensive insurance coverage 
we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and other of our business operations in specific markets 
such coverage includes property  liability  fire  flood  earthquake  environmental  terrorism  extended coverage and rental loss 
we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties  business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured 
however  an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated profits 
item a 
risk factors our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of our common shares 
these risks include  among others general real estate risks general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated  such as california  may impact financial results 
we are exposed to the general economic conditions  the local  regional  national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties 
our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in 
table of contents which we have concentrations of properties 
approximately of our north american properties based on our investment before depreciation in our direct owned portfolio are located in california 
properties in california may be more susceptible to certain types of natural disasters  such as earthquakes  brush fires  flooding and mudslides  than properties located in other markets and a major natural disaster in california could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we also have significant holdings in certain markets of our direct owned portfolio located in atlanta  chicago  dallas fort worth and new jersey 
our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties 
conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space may impact operating conditions 
any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of our securities 
in addition  the property funds in which we have an ownership interest have concentrations of properties in the same markets  as well as the united kingdom and japan 
real property investments are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio  market research and our property management capabilities  these risks cannot be eliminated 
some of the factors that may affect real estate values include changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area  the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers  competition from other available properties  our ability to provide adequate maintenance of  and insurance on  our properties  our ability to control rents and variable operating costs  governmental regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws and changes in these laws  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning and other laws 
our investments are concentrated in the industrial sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector 
our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector 
this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included a more significant portion of other sectors of the real estate industry 
our real estate development strategies may not be successful 
we have developed a significant number of distribution properties since our inception and intend to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise 
in addition  we currently own approximately  acres of land for future potential development of distribution properties and other commercial real estate projects 
such development activities generally require various government and other approvals and we may not receive such approvals 
we will be subject to risks associated with such development activities including  but not limited to the risk that development opportunities explored by us may be abandoned and the related investment will be impaired  the risk that we may not be able to obtain  or may experience delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  building  occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations  
table of contents the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop  especially in asia  the risk that construction costs of a property may exceed the original estimates or that construction may not be concluded on schedule  making the project less profitable than originally estimated or not profitable at all  including the possibility of contract default  the effects of local weather conditions  the possibility of local or national strikes and the possibility of shortages in materials  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment  and the risk that occupancy levels and the rents that can be charged for a completed project will not be met  making the project unprofitable 
our business strategy associated with contributing properties to funds we manage or disposing of properties to third parties may not be successful 
we have contributed to property funds  or sold to third parties  a significant number of distribution properties in recent years and we intend to continue to contribute and sell properties as opportunities arise  particularly from our cdfs business segment  which is an integral part of our business strategy 
our ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties  current market conditions  including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties  and other factors beyond our control 
our ability to develop and timely lease properties will impact our ability to contribute or sell these properties 
continued access to private and public debt and equity capital by the property funds is necessary in order for us to continue our strategy of contributing properties to property funds 
should we not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds  or should the property funds have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms  then these contributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on our liquidity and on our ability to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet our projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  distributable cash flow and on the value of our securities 
further  our inability to redeploy the proceeds from our divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  distributable cash flow  our ability to meet our debt obligations in a timely manner and the value of our securities in subsequent periods 
our growth will depend on future acquisitions of distribution properties  which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 
we acquire distribution properties from time to time in both our property operations and cdfs business segments 
the acquisition of properties involves risks  including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation  repositioning  renovation and improvements identified in the pre acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates 
there is  and it is expected that there will continue to be  significant competition for investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities  if necessary 
our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers 
our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations 
we are also subject to the risk that  upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties  leases may not be renewed by existing customers  the space may not be re leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re leasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
in the event of default by a significant number of customers  we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord 
a customer may experience a downturn in its business  which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition  resulting in the customer s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash 
table of contents flow from the lease 
in addition  a customer of any of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy  insolvency or similar laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 
our ability to renew leases or re lease space on favorable terms as leases expire significantly affects our business 
our results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of our securities would be adversely affected if we are unable to lease  on economically favorable terms  a significant amount of space in our operating properties 
we had million square feet of distribution  retail and office space with leases that either expired on december  or were on a month to month basis at that date and we have million square feet of distribution  retail and office space out of a total of million occupied square feet with leases that expire in in our direct owned properties 
the property funds had a combined million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december  or were on a month to month basis at that date and the property funds have a combined million square feet of distribution space out of a total of million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in the number of distribution  retail and office properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both our ability to re lease the space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 
for the past two years  our rental rates on new or renewed leases of previously leased distribution space have declined 
the fact that real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets may reduce economic returns to investors 
real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the code  we must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties that can be disposed of in a year  the tax bases and the costs of improvements made to these properties  and meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  our ability at any time to sell assets  or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in which we have an ownership interest may be restricted 
our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 
we and our unconsolidated investees currently carry comprehensive insurance coverage including property  liability  fire  flood  earthquake  environmental  terrorism  extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located 
the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties  business activities and markets 
we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated investees  including the property funds  are adequately insured 
however  there are certain losses  including losses from floods  earthquakes  acts of war  acts of terrorism or riots  that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties  we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 
we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results and financial condition 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such 
table of contents substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
a majority of the properties we have acquired were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or by the predecessor owners 
while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling  none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in connection with the catellus merger  we acquired certain properties in urban and industrial areas that may have been leased to or previously owned by commercial and industrial companies that discharged hazardous materials 
in accordance with purchase accounting  we recorded a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation to be incurred in connection with certain operating properties acquired and properties previously sold by catellus 
this liability was established to cover the environmental remediation costs  including cleanup costs  consulting fees for studies and investigations  monitoring costs and legal costs relating to cleanup  litigation defense  and the pursuit of responsible third parties 
in addition  we will incur environmental remediation costs associated with certain land parcels acquired in the catellus merger in connection with the development of the land 
we purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities 
we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  we cannot give any assurance that such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future 
the presence of such substances on our real estate investments could adversely affect our ability to sell such investments or to borrow using such investments as collateral and may also have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 
risks related to financing and capital our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we do not continue to have access to capital on favorable terms 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our shareholders 
consequently  we are  as are all reits  largely dependent on external capital to fund our development and acquisition activities 
we have been accessing private or public debt and equity capital through the establishment of property funds that acquire properties 
our ability to access capital through the property funds is dependent upon a number of factors  including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies 
further  we generate significant profits as a result of the contributions of properties to the property funds 
to the extent that capital is not available to the property funds to allow them to acquire our properties  these profits may not be realized or their realization may be delayed which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of our competitors and result in us not meeting our projected earnings and distributable cash flow levels in a particular reporting period 
our ability to contribute or sell properties from our development pipeline and recognize profits from our development activities will be jeopardized and our ability to meet projected earnings levels and generate distributable cash flow would be adversely affected should the existing equity commitments to the property funds not be available due to investor default or otherwise such that these property funds cannot acquire the properties that we expect to have available for contribution 
this impact would occur in the short term and would continue until we are able to sell the properties to third parties or until we could secure another source of capital to finance the properties 
failure to meet our projected earnings and distributable cash flow levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and on the market price of our securities 

table of contents our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt on favorable terms 
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness  that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness  or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations  the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and we may lose the property securing such indebtedness 
covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition 
the terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage 
these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations  the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected 
federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect our cash flows 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with our taxable year ended december  in addition  we have a subsidiary that has elected to be taxed as a reit beginning in and certain unconsolidated investees that are reits  and are subject to all the risks pertaining to the reit structure  discussed herein 
to maintain reit status  we must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis 
those requirements seek to ensure  among other things  that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related  that a reit distributes substantially all of its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit s equity ownership is not overly concentrated 
due to the complex nature of these rules  the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules  the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law  administrative interpretations of the law and changes in our business  no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will be taxed as a regular corporation  and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing our taxable income 
the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce our cash flow and funds available for reinvestment 
moreover  we might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if we later requalified as a reit  we might be required to pay a full corporate level tax on any unrealized gains in our assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to our shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of non reit status 
potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our financial condition 
to maintain qualification as a reit under the code  a reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least of its reit taxable income  excluding the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital 
we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements 
difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for our funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements  because income may have to be reported before cash is 
table of contents received  because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited  or the internal revenue service the irs may make a determination that adjusts reported income 
in those situations  we might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply which could adversely affect our financial condition 
if we fail to make a required distribution  we would cease to be taxed as a reit 
prohibited transaction income could result from certain property transfers 
we contribute properties to property funds and sell properties to third parties from the reit and from taxable reit subsidiaries trs 
under the code  a disposition of a property from other than a taxable subsidiary could be deemed to be a prohibited transaction 
in such case  a penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed 
the determination that a transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction 
the irs could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by us are prohibited transactions 
while we do not believe the irs would prevail in such a dispute  if the irs successfully argued the matter  the penalty tax could be assessed against the gains from these transactions 
additionally  any gain from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
liabilities recorded for pre existing tax audits may not be sufficient 
catellus is subject to pending audits by the irs and the california franchise tax board of its through income tax returns  including certain of its subsidiaries and partnerships 
we have recorded an accrual that represents our best estimate of the liabilities that may arise from these audits 
the audits may result in an adjustment in which the actual liabilities or settlement costs  including interest and potential penalties  if any  may prove to be more than the liability we have recorded 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item uncertainties relating to catellus estimate of its earnings and profits attributable to c corporation taxable years may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 
in order to qualify as a reit  a reit cannot have at the end of any reit taxable year any undistributed earnings and profits that are attributable to a c corporation taxable year 
a reit has until the close of its first full taxable year as a reit in which it has non reit earnings and profits to distribute these accumulated earnings and profits 
because catellus first full taxable year as a reit was  catellus was required to distribute these earnings and profits prior to the end of failure to meet this requirement would result in catellus disqualification as a reit 
catellus distributed its accumulated non reit earnings and profits in december  well in advance of the year end deadline  and believed that this distribution was sufficient to distribute all of its non reit earnings and profits 
however  the determination of non reit earnings and profits is complicated and depends upon facts with respect to which catellus may have less than complete information or the application of the law governing earnings and profits  which is subject to differing interpretations  or both 
consequently  there are substantial uncertainties relating to the estimate of catellus non reit earnings and profits  and we cannot be assured that the earnings and profits distribution requirement has been met 
these uncertainties include the possibility that the irs could upon audit increase the taxable income of catellus  which would increase the non reit earnings and profits of catellus 
there can be no assurances that we have satisfied the requirement that catellus distribute all of its non reit earnings and profits by the close of its first taxable year as a reit  and therefore  this may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 
there are potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities that could affect our operating results or financial condition 
palmtree acquisition corporation  our subsidiary that was the surviving corporation in the catellus merger  is subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently and potential state taxes on any gain recognized within ten years of catellus conversion to a reit from a 
table of contents disposition of any assets that catellus held at the effective time of its election to be a reit  but only to the extent of the built in gain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the reit election which was january  
gain from a sale of an asset occurring more than years after the reit conversion will not be subject to this corporate level tax 
we do not currently expect to dispose of any asset of the surviving corporation in the merger if such a disposition would result in the imposition of a material tax liability unless we can affect a tax deferred exchange of the property 
however  certain assets are subject to third party purchase options that may require us to sell such assets  and those assets may carry deferred tax liabilities that would be triggered on such sales 
we have recorded deferred tax liabilities related to these built in gains 
there can be no assurances that our plans in this regard will not change and  if such plans do change or if a purchase option is exercised  that we will be successful in structuring a tax deferred exchange 
other risks we are dependent on key personnel 
our executive and other senior officers have a significant role in our success 
our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market 
the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow 
further  such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 
share prices may be affected by market interest rates 
the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of our market price may influence the trading price of such common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate than we have set  which could adversely affect the value of our common shares 
the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invest in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and through the use of derivative contracts  there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 
we are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition 
there are many laws and governmental regulations that apply to us  our unconsolidated investees and our properties 
changes in these laws and governmental regulations  or their interpretation by agencies or the courts  could occur 
further  economic and political factors  including civil unrest  governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders in the united states  but primarily in the foreign countries in which we have invested  can have a major impact on us as a global company

table of contents distributions and dividends in order to comply with the reit requirements of the code  we are generally required to make common share distributions and preferred share dividends other than capital gain distributions to our shareholders in amounts that together at least equal i the sum of a of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and b of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus ii certain excess noncash income 
our common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the code and that allows us to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs  such as capital improvements and other investment activities 
we announce the following year s projected annual common share distribution level after the board performs its annual budget review and approves a common share distribution level  generally in december of each year 
in december  the board announced an increase in the annual distribution level for from to per common share

funds from operations ffo is a non us generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry 
the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings 
although the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has published a definition of ffo  modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits  as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 
ffo  as we define it  is presented as a supplemental financial measure 
ffo is not used by us as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of our ability to fund our cash needs 
ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor do we intend it to present  a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance 
we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap 
further  we believe that our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 
at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo concept for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
we believe that financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo 
our ffo measure is discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report and the matters described under item a 
risk factors 
management s overview we are a self administered and self managed reit that operates a global network of real estate properties  primarily industrial distribution properties 
the primary business drivers across the globe continue to be the need for greater distribution network efficiency and the growing shift to third party logistics providers 
our focus on our customers expanding needs has enabled us to become a leading global provider of distribution space in three continents 
during the third quarter of  we announced the creation of a new property fund in asia  the prologis japan properties fund ii  and we completed the catellus merger  which significantly increased our property portfolio and opportunities for new property funds 
in february  we finalized and announced the creation of a new open end fund  the north american industrial fund 
due to our successful growth and continued emphasis in the fund management business  we redefined our reportable business segments  as discussed below  to reflect our current business strategy 
our business is currently organized into three reportable business segments i property operations  ii fund management and iii cdfs business 
the property operations segment represents the direct long term ownership  and the management and leasing of industrial distribution and retail properties  both directly and indirectly owned 
the fund management segment represents the long term investment management of unconsolidated property funds and the properties they own  to generate a high level of returns to us and our fund partners 
the cdfs business segment primarily encompasses our development or acquisition of properties that are generally contributed to an unconsolidated property fund in which we have an ownership interest and act as manager 
we also have other segments that do not meet the threshold criteria to disclose as a reportable segment 
these operations primarily include our i management of land subject to ground leases  ii office property operations  and iii the ownership or investment in hotel properties 
we generate and seek to increase revenues  earnings  ffo and cash flows through our segments primarily as follows property operations segment we earn rent from our customers under long term operating leases  including reimbursements of certain operating costs  in our industrial distribution and retail properties that we own directly in north america  europe and asia 
we expect to grow our revenue through increases in properties owned and increases in occupancy rates and rental rates in both our industrial distribution and retail properties 
our strategy is to achieve these increases primarily through the acquisition of industrial distribution properties  continued focus on our customers global needs for distribution space in the three continents in which we operate and use of the prologis operating system 
fund management segment we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated property funds operating in north america  europe and asia 
along with the income recognized under the equity method  we include fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of the property funds primarily property management and asset management services and interest earned on advances to the property funds  if any 
we also earn certain other fees for services provided to the property funds  such as acquisition  financing and development fees 
we expect growth in income recognized to come from newly created property funds  as discussed below  and growth in existing property funds 
the growth in the existing property funds is expected 
table of contents to come primarily from additional properties the funds will acquire  generally from us  and increased rental revenues in the property funds due  in part  to our leasing and property management efforts from our property operations segment 
cdfs business segment we recognize income primarily from the contributions of developed and repositioned properties to the property funds and from dispositions to third parties 
in addition  we earn fees from our customers or other third parties for development activities that we provide on their behalf  recognize interest income on notes receivable related to asset dispositions  recognize net gains from the disposition of land parcels that no longer fit into our development plans and recognize our proportionate share of the income generated by development joint ventures in which we have an investment 
we expect increases in this segment to come primarily from the continued development of high quality industrial distribution properties in our key markets in north america  europe and asia  resulting in the contribution to property funds or sale to third parties 
in addition  we expect to increase our land and other commercial development activities for development fees and sales to third parties 
summary of the fundamentals of our business were strong in we increased our total operating portfolio of industrial distribution and retail properties owned or managed  including direct owned properties  and properties owned by the property funds and cdfs joint ventures  to million square feet at december  from million square feet at december  we increased our same store net operating income as defined below by in over same store rent growth for all of was a negative  compared with a negative in and a negative in the negative trend in rental rates started to reverse in the third and fourth quarters of when we had positive same store rent growth of and  respectively  for the first time since the second quarter of the stabilized leased percentage as defined below was at december   compared with at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings before minority interest 
net operating income of the cdfs business segment increased over primarily due to the higher gross margins that were earned on contributions and increased development fees and interest income 
we started the development of projects with a total expected cost at completion of billion and completed development projects at a total cost of billion in this compares with when we started development projects with a total expected cost at completion of billion and completed development projects at a total cost of billion 
the increased development activity was spurred by increased demand for industrial distribution properties in north america  europe and asia 
in january  we announced our first development in south korea  which we expect to complete in the first half of the strong development activity  along with the access to capital through the property funds  supported improved contribution activity in key transactions in and early we completed the catellus merger on september  we believe this strategic combination of two industrial real estate companies was in the best interest of our shareholders and will achieve key elements of our strategic business plan by strengthening our position in the north american logistics market 
the catellus merger enhanced the north american property portfolio in key markets  increased our development property base and capabilities  reduced the overall age of our property portfolio and we believe it will allow us to build on our existing customer relationships 
the total purchase price of billion was financed through the issuance of approximately million prologis common shares  the assumption of approximately billion of liabilities including billion of debt and cash of billion 
we financed the cash portion of the catellus merger primarily through borrowings on a short term bridge facility  which was partially repaid with the proceeds of a senior note issuance  and borrowings 
table of contents under our global credit facility  each as described below 
our results of operations for include the results of the combined company beginning on september  our integration efforts are proceeding according to our expectations 
the majority of the operating assets  liabilities and business operations of catellus have been integrated into our existing business processes and did not require significant changes to our processes 
for more information about the catellus merger  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item on september   we acquired the remaining ownership interest in prologis north american properties fund xii 
the acquisition resulted in an aggregate property value of million being added to our direct owned portfolio in the property operations segment 
on october   we closed a billion global credit facility that increases our flexibility to borrow in multiple currencies global line and has a four year maturity 
in november  we completed the issuance of million of senior notes in a private offering under section of the securities act of the proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the short term bridge facility discussed above 
we formed a new property fund  prologis japan properties fund ii  in which we own a interest 
our fund partner has committed total capital of million  none of which was funded at december  we made the strategic decision to exit certain markets that we no longer view as target markets kansas city  oklahoma city and tulsa 
we recognized gains of million in the third and fourth quarters of  primarily related to the disposition of operating properties from the property operations segment  primarily in these markets 
we completed the disposition of our temperature controlled distribution business in france 
we recognized cumulative translation losses and an impairment loss of million in related to these operations 
our board approved an increase in our annual distribution in to per common share  from per common share  or an increase of 
the common share distribution is declared quarterly and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board 
in february  we finalized and announced the formation of a new open end property fund  the north american industrial fund  with several institutional investors  which will primarily own recently developed industrial distribution properties in major distribution markets throughout the united states and canada 
on january   we purchased the remaining ownership interests in each of prologis north american properties funds ii  iii and iv from our fund partner  an affiliate of arcapita and in march  we contributed substantially all of the assets and associated liabilities we obtained in this acquisition to the north american industrial fund 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management 
generally  the judgment requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
of the accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item  those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize gains and losses from the contributions and sales of real estate assets  generally at the time the title is transferred and we have no future involvement  as a direct owner of the real estate asset contributed or sold 
in many of our transactions  an entity in which we have an ownership interest will 
table of contents acquire a real estate asset from us 
we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets 
our ability to accurately assess the provisions of each transaction under the accounting guidelines for profit recognition could impact our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance 
business combinations we acquire individual properties  as well as portfolios of properties or businesses 
when we acquire a property for investment purposes  we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component 
the components typically include land  building  debt and other assumed liabilities  and intangible assets related to above and below market leases  leasing commissions and goodwill in the case of an acquisition of a business 
in an acquisition of multiple properties  we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties 
the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis and all entities that we control  either as the primary beneficiary or through ownership of a majority voting interest  or otherwise 
investments in entities in which we do not own a majority voting interest but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method 
investments in entities in which we do not own a majority voting interest and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  as appropriate 
our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involve the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest  our representation on the entity s governing body  the size of our investment including loans  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process 
our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements and  consequently  our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance 
capitalization of costs and depreciation we capitalize costs incurred in developing  renovating  acquiring and rehabilitating real estate assets as part of the investment basis 
costs incurred in making certain other improvements are also capitalized 
during the land development and construction periods  we capitalize interest costs  insurance  real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development  renovations  rehabilitation and leasing activities if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity 
capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets except for the costs capitalized related to leasing activities  which are presented as a component of other assets 
we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense 
our ability to accurately estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets 
any change to the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and  with respect to goodwill  at least annually applying a fair value based test 
the determination of the fair value of long lived assets  
table of contents including goodwill  involves significant judgment 
this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each long lived asset 
our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value 
if there is a decline in the fair value of a long lived asset or a history of the asset generating operating losses  we determine whether the operating losses associated with the asset will continue 
our assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results  the resulting cash flows and our intent to either hold or dispose of the long lived asset 
if an investment is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recognized based on these analyses 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our current income tax liability and the liability associated with open tax years that are under review 
our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
when we take a deduction for a non routine transaction in which the tax impact is uncertain  no financial statement benefit is taken until the impact is certain 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in assessments of the recognition of tax benefits for certain non routine transactions  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  our inability to qualify as a reit  the potential for built in gain recognition  changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to trss and changes in tax laws 
adjustments required in any given period are included within the tax provision in the statements of earnings 
results of operations net earnings attributable to common shares were million in  million in and million in basic and diluted net earnings attributable to common shares were and per share  respectively  in  and per share  respectively  in and and per share  respectively  in the increase in net earnings in over is primarily due to improved property operating performance  gains on dispositions of non cdfs assets during the third and fourth quarters of  increases in income from the property funds  increased net gains from the disposition of cdfs business assets and to the catellus merger 
the decrease in net earnings in over was primarily due to losses related to temperature controlled assets in which were disposed of in and lower gains recognized from dispositions of non cdfs business assets and investments in property funds  partially offset by improvements in property operating performance and an increase in income from the property funds 
portfolio information in the discussion that follows  we present the results of operations by reportable business segment 
the following table summarizes our total operating portfolio as of the dates indicated square feet in thousands december  number of square number of square number of square reportable business segment properties feet properties feet properties feet property operations fund management cdfs business totals 
table of contents includes industrial distribution properties owned by the property funds  in which our ownership interests ranged from to at december  represents operating industrial distribution properties and excludes eight properties under development aggregating million square feet  owned by the cdfs joint ventures  in which our weighted ownership interest was at december  in addition  these amounts do not include our properties aggregating million square feet currently under development or our operating properties that were developed or acquired in this segment  but which are currently included in the property operations segment pending contribution 
the stabilized operating properties owned by us  the property funds and cdfs industrial joint ventures were leased at december   leased at december  and leased at december  the stabilized properties are those properties where the capital improvements  repositioning efforts  new management and new marketing programs for acquisitions or the marketing programs in the case of newly developed properties  have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time to achieve stabilization 
a property generally enters the stabilized pool at the earlier of months from acquisition or completion or when it becomes substantially leased  which we define generally as 
same store analysis we evaluate the operating performance of the properties included in each of our three reportable business segments using a same store analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period  thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures 
we include properties owned directly  by the property funds and by the cdfs joint ventures  as applicable  in the same store analysis 
accordingly  we define the same store portfolio of operating properties for each period as those properties that have been in operation throughout the full period in both the current and prior year 
when a property is disposed of to a third party  it is removed from the population for the full quarter in which it is disposed and the corresponding period of the prior year 
the same store portfolio aggregated million square feet at december  and included only industrial distribution properties 
same store results were as follows net operating income generated by the same store portfolio defined for the same store analysis as rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees  less rental expenses increased in over for  the net operating income of the same store portfolio applicable to that period increased by over the same store portfolio s rental rates  associated with leasing activity for space that has been previously leased by us  decreased in by 
for  the same store portfolio s rental rates decreased from the negative trend in rental rates started to reverse in the third and fourth quarters of when we had positive same store rent growth of and  respectively  for the first time since the second quarter of average occupancy in the same store portfolio increased in over this compares to a increase in average occupancy in over same store rental income increased in over and rental expenses increased in over in  same store rental income increased while rental expenses increased  both over we believe the factors that impact net operating income  rental rates and average occupancy in the same store portfolio are the same as for the total portfolio 
the percentage change presented is the weighted average of the measure computed separately for us and each of the property funds with the weighting based on each entity s proportionate share of the combined component on which the change is computed 
in order to derive an appropriate measure of period to period operating performance  the 
table of contents percentage change computation removes the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by computing each property s components in that property s functional currency 
rental income computed under gaap applicable to the properties included in the same store portfolio is adjusted to remove the net termination and renegotiation fees recognized in each period 
net termination and renegotiation fees excluded from rental income for the same store portfolio including properties directly owned and properties owned by the property funds and cdfs joint ventures were million for and million for net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease  offset by the write off of the asset recognized due to the adjustment to straight line rents over the lease term  if any 
removing the net termination fees from the same store calculation of rental income allows us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property s rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property s recurring operating performance 
in computing the percentage change in rental expenses  the rental expenses applicable to the properties in the same store portfolio include property management expenses for our direct owned properties 
these expenses are based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual agreements under which our wholly owned management company provides property management services to each property generally  the fee is based on a percentage of revenues 
on consolidation  the management fee income earned by the management company and the management fee expense recognized by the properties are eliminated and the direct costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our rental expenses reported under gaap 
operational outlook changes in economic conditions will generally impact customer leasing decisions and absorption of new distribution properties 
beginning in the last half of and continuing throughout  weakening economic conditions in the united states and certain western european countries and certain geopolitical concerns and uncertainties  primarily in europe  negatively impacted our stabilized occupancy levels 
in the second quarter of  we began to observe improvements in north american absorption and occupancy levels  which have continued during during this time  we also experienced improvements in leasing activity in europe  primarily with respect to the existing pipeline of cdfs business assets that were included in the property operations segment prior to being contributed or sold 
with respect to japan and china  we continue to experience consistent demand for distribution space in our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated investees 
we expect that the overall economic improvements experienced in will continue into accordingly  we believe the positive trends in occupancy in north america and europe will continue in however  we do not expect that occupancies will improve in to the levels experienced in the to period  when occupancies were as high as 
we continue to believe that shifts in distribution patterns of our customers throughout the world and their need to reduce their distribution costs have been  and will continue to be  key drivers of leasing decisions 
we believe the diversification of our global operating platform and the prologis operating system have somewhat mitigated the effects of market occupancy decreases in the past and position us well to take advantage of the positive occupancy trends 
we believe the decrease in rental rates experienced during and continues to be the result of economic conditions that depressed market rents such that they were generally below the rents that we were earning on expiring long term leases and continued compression of capitalization rates in our markets 
the negative trend in rental rates started to reverse in the third and fourth quarters of when we had positive same store rent growth of and  respectively  for the first time since the second quarter of we believe this positive trend in rental rate growth will continue into 
table of contents property operations segment the net operating income of the property operations segment consists of rental income and rental expenses from the industrial distribution and retail operating properties that we directly own 
the costs of our property management function for both our direct owned portfolio and the properties owned by the property funds are all reported in rental expenses in the property operations segment 
the net earnings or losses generated by operating properties that were developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment are included in the property operations segment during the interim period from the date of completion or acquisition through the date the properties are contributed or sold 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings before minority interest 
the net operating income from the property operations segment was as follows for the periods indicated in thousands 
years ended december  rental income rental expenses total property operations segment amounts in include the results of the properties acquired in the catellus merger from september through december  amounts do not include rental income and rental expenses associated with the properties that are presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements  as follows see note to our consolidated financial statements in item rental income of million in  million in and million in rental expenses of million in  million in and million in the number and composition of operating properties that we own throughout the periods and the timing of contributions impact rental income for each period 
rental income includes net termination and renegotiation fees of million in  million in and million in in certain leasing situations  we find it advantageous to negotiate lease terminations with a customer  particularly when the customer is experiencing financial difficulties or when we believe we can re lease the space at rates that  when combined with the termination fee  provide a total return in excess of what was being earned under the original lease terms 
we cannot predict the level of such fees that will be earned in the future or whether we will be successful in re leasing  in a timely manner  the vacant space associated with the lease terminations 
rental expense recoveries from customers  a component of rental income  were million in  million in and million in including discontinued operations  rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees and rental expense recoveries  was million in  million in and million in the increase in rental income in over prior periods is due primarily to the catellus merger and other acquisitions and also due to increased rental income in the same store properties due to increased occupancy  partially offset by dispositions 
the number and composition of operating properties that we own throughout the periods presented impact rental expenses for each period 
rental expenses are presented before any recoveries from customers  which are a component of rental income 
when a property is contributed to a property fund  we begin reporting our share of the earnings of the property under the equity method along with fee income earned for services provided to the property funds in the fund management segment  and no longer report the operations of the property as part of rental income and rental expenses 
however  the overhead costs incurred by us to provide the management services to the property fund continue to be reported as part of rental expenses 

table of contents fund management segment the net operating income of the fund management segment consists of i income or losses recognized under the equity method from our investments in the property funds  ii fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of the property funds primarily property management and asset management services and iii interest earned on advances to the property funds  if any 
the net earnings or losses of the property funds include the following income and expense items of the property funds  in addition to rental income and rental expenses i interest income and interest expense  ii depreciation and amortization expenses  iii general and administrative expenses  iv income tax expense  and v foreign currency exchange gains and losses

the net operating income from the fund management segment was as follows for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  income from property funds prologis north american properties funds prologis european properties fund prologis japan properties fund i total fund management segment the earnings from the property funds includes fees and incentives earned by us for providing services to the property funds of million in  million in and million in fees earned for providing services to the property funds for other than property management and asset management services can fluctuate from year to year 
the costs of the property management function for the properties owned by the property funds are reported in the property operations segment and the costs of the fund management function are included in general and administrative expenses 
this represents the income earned by us from our investments in property funds in north america  including our proportionate share of the earnings or losses of the property funds and property management and other fees and incentives 
we had interests in   and six funds at december   and  respectively 
we had ownership interest in property funds during and and in six property funds in  with ownership interests ranging from to 
with respect to the income from these funds  fluctuations between years in the amount that we recognize under the equity method are generally due to the number of property funds  the number of properties owned by the property funds  occupancy levels and the amount of termination and renegotiation fees earned by the property funds 
these property funds on a combined basis owned  and properties at december   and  respectively 
in january  we purchased the remaining ownership interests in three of the property funds and subsequently contributed substantially all of the assets and associated liabilities to the newly formed north american industrial fund see note to our consolidated financial statements in item 
prologis european properties fund has continued to acquire properties  primarily from us  and increase its portfolio size since it began operations in this property fund owned  and properties at december   and  respectively 
our ownership interest in prologis european properties fund was at december   at december  and at december  the fluctuations in income recognized from our ownership interest in this property fund are primarily the result of the following factors i the size of the portfolio and occupancy levels in each period  ii increases in the fees earned for services provided to the property fund due to the increase in the number of properties managed  iii higher interest costs associated with the higher debt levels that primarily result from the use of debt to acquire the additional 
table of contents properties  iv decreases in our ownership interest in each year  and v variances in the average foreign currency exchange rate at which we translate our share of the net earnings of the property fund to us dollars 
prologis japan properties fund i has increased its portfolio to properties aggregating million square feet at december  from properties aggregating million square feet at december  and from five properties aggregating million square feet at december  our ownership interest in prologis japan properties fund i has been since inception 
the increases in the amounts recognized under the equity method from our ownership in this property fund correspond with the growth in the portfolio over the three years 
in  we formed a second fund in japan that did not have any operations or assets in see note to our consolidated financial statements in item 
cdfs business net operating income from the cdfs business segment consists primarily of i gains and losses resulting from the contributions and dispositions of properties  generally developed by us or acquired with the intent to rehabilitate or reposition  ii gains and losses from the dispositions of land parcels  iii fees earned for development services provided to customers and third parties  iv interest income earned on notes receivable related to property sales  v our proportionate share of the earnings or losses of cdfs joint ventures  and vi land holding costs and the write off of previously capitalized pursuit costs associated with potential cdfs business assets when it becomes likely they would not be acquired 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings before minority interest 
for  our net operating income in this segment was million  an increase from of million or an increase of million or when the gains from dispositions of cdfs business properties that are presented as discontinued operations are included 
the increase in operating income recognized in  as compared with  reflects higher gross margins on contributions and increased development fees and interest income 
in  of the net operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america  was generated in europe and was generated in asia 
in  of the net operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america  was generated in europe and was generated in asia 
in  we contributed buildings in north america  in europe and three in japan for a net gain of million  compared with buildings in in north america  in europe and three in japan for a net gain of million 
in  of the properties contributed were repositioned acquisitions  which generally have a much lower gross margin 
we attribute the strong performance in to increased development activity and improved leasing activity for cdfs business properties 
we believe the increase in leasing activity results from improvements in economic conditions that have positively impacted our customers decisions with respect to changes in their distribution networks and increased demand that is driven by the need for distribution efficiencies  primarily in europe and asia 
there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain or increase the current level of net operating income in this segment

when we contribute a property to a property fund in which we have an ownership interest  we do not recognize a portion of the proceeds in the computation of the gain resulting from the contribution 
the amount of the proceeds that cannot be recognized is determined based on our continuing ownership interest in the contributed property that arises due to our ownership interest in the property fund that acquires the property 
we defer this portion of the proceeds by recognizing a reduction to our investment in the respective property fund 
we adjust our proportionate share of earnings or losses that we recognize under the equity method from the property fund in later periods to reflect the property fund s depreciation expense as if the depreciation expense was computed on our lower basis in the contributed property rather than on the property fund s basis in the contributed property 
if a loss results when a property is contributed to a property fund  the entire loss is recognized 
when a property that we originally contributed to a property fund is disposed of to a third party by the property fund  we recognize in earnings the net amount of proceeds we had previously deferred in the period that the disposition to the third party occurs  in addition to our proportionate share of the net gain or loss recognized by the property fund 
further  during periods when our ownership interest in a property fund decreases  we recognize gains to the extent that previously deferred proceeds are recognized to coincide with our new ownership interest in the property fund 
our ownership interests in prologis north american properties fund v and prologis european properties fund decreases from time to time 
when this occurs  previously deferred proceeds are recognized as gains in the period the ownership decrease occurs  unless it is a temporary decline 
of the total for  million related to a partial redemption of our investment in prologis european properties fund

eight cdfs business properties aggregating million square feet and ten cdfs business properties aggregating million square feet that were sold to third parties in and respectively  met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item income from the cdfs business segment is dependent on several factors  including but not limited to i our ability to develop and timely lease properties  ii our ability to acquire properties that eventually can be contributed to property funds  iii our ability to generate a profit from these activities and iv our success in raising capital to be used to acquire the properties we developed or repositioned 
generally  we raise capital through the property funds 
we continue to monitor leasing activity and general economic conditions as it pertains to the cdfs business segment 
in north america  we observed the early signs of economic recovery in and throughout and we believe continued improvement could provide increased cdfs business opportunities 
during  we started development in toronto  canada and believe this market  along with our existing markets in the united states and mexico  will provide future opportunities within the cdfs business segment in north america 
in addition  as part of the catellus merger  we acquired  acres of land for future potential development in north america in our existing markets and also acquired interests in several entities that engage in land and commercial development activities in north america  all of which we believe will provide additional cdfs business opportunities 
in europe  we believe the continued demand for state of the art industrial distribution properties resulted in improved leasing activity in and such factors could continue to provide opportunities for us in the cdfs business segment including additional fees for the development of projects for third parties 
in asia  we believe demand for state of the art industrial distribution properties will continue to provide opportunities for us in the cdfs business segment 
in japan  the cdfs business opportunities available to us will be limited if we are unable to acquire adequate land parcels for development 
in china  we are positioning ourselves to meet what we believe will be significant future demand for distribution space due to the expected growth in manufacturing and consumer demand for goods 
we started our first development in south korea in other components of operating income general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in fluctuations in general and administrative expenses are influenced by the various business initiatives we are undertaking in a given period 
the increase in general and administrative 
table of contents expenses in over is primarily due to i the overall growth of the company resulting from the continuing international expansion of our operating platform  the catellus merger and the creation of additional property funds  ii increased stock compensation expense  and iii to a lesser extent  foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our consolidated foreign subsidiaries general and administrative expenses to us dollars  which resulted in higher expenses in us dollars in as compared to other than the catellus merger  the same factors contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses in over depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase is due primarily to the increased level of real estate assets and intangible lease assets acquired in the catellus merger and other acquisitions and improvements of properties in our property operations segment during this period 
merger integration costs these costs are indirect costs associated with the catellus merger  such as employee transition costs as well as severance costs for certain of our employees whose responsibilities became redundant after the merger 
we expect to incur integration costs associated with the catellus merger through the first half of  although the majority of these costs were incurred in relocation expenses we relocated our information technology and corporate accounting functions from el paso  texas to denver  colorado in the first quarter of the relocation to our new denver corporate headquarters building was completed in february in connection with these two moves  we recognized total costs of million and million in and  respectively  which included employee termination benefits  accelerated depreciation associated with non real estate assets whose useful lives were shortened due to the relocations  hiring and training of new personnel and moving costs 
interest expense the increase in interest expense for  as compared with  is due to increases in our borrowings  primarily as a result of the catellus merger and changes in the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate to us dollars the interest expense recognized by our foreign subsidiaries prior to consolidation  offset somewhat by a decline in weighted average interest rates and additional capitalized interest 
other than the catellus merger  the increase in the borrowings is primarily due to our increased investments in property funds and cdfs joint ventures  individual and portfolio acquisitions and increased development activity 
the increase in capitalized interest for as compared with is due to the significant increase in our development activities  partially offset by lower interest rates 
foreign currency exchange gains expenses losses  net we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in that entity s functional currency 
when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity  a gain or loss can result 
to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure  we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when possible 
certain of our intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
this treatment is applicable to intercompany debt that is deemed a permanent source of capital to the subsidiary or investee 
if the intercompany debt is deemed not permanent in nature  when the debt is remeasured  we recognize a gain or loss 
additionally  we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage certain foreign currency exchange risks  primarily put option contracts with notional amounts corresponding to our projected net

see note to our consolidated financial statements in item income taxes we and one of our subsidiaries have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code  and are not generally required to pay federal income taxes if we make distributions in excess of taxable income and meet the reit requirements of the code 
our consolidated subsidiaries in the united states that are not qualified reit subsidiaries qrs for tax purposes are subject to federal income taxes  and we are taxed in certain states in which we operate 
in addition  the foreign countries where we have operations do not necessarily recognize reits under their respective tax laws 
accordingly  we recognize income taxes for these jurisdictions  as necessary 
current income tax expense is generally a function of the level of income recognized by our taxable subsidiaries operating primarily in the cdfs business segment  state income taxes  taxes incurred in foreign jurisdictions and interest associated with our income tax liabilities 
during  we disposed of a higher volume of properties to third parties that were located in the united kingdom  which generated a higher level of net gains that are included in taxable income in that country 
this higher volume in is the primary reason for the decrease in expense in compared to and for the increase in expense in from the deferred income tax component of total income taxes is generally a function of the period s temporary differences items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for book purposes  the utilization of tax net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred tax assets  and deferred tax liabilities related to certain indemnification agreements 
we recognize deferred income tax accruals associated with certain property contributions to prologis european properties fund beginning in the third quarter of and prologis north american properties fund v beginning in the second quarter of

our credit facilities provide liquidity and financial flexibility  which allows us to efficiently respond to market opportunities and execute our business strategy 
regular repayments of our credit facilities are necessary to allow us to maintain adequate liquidity 
we anticipate future repayments of the borrowings under our credit facilities will be funded primarily through the proceeds from future property contributions and sales and from proceeds generated by future issuances of debt or equity securities  depending on market conditions 
on november   in a private placement  we issued million senior notes due november notes and million senior notes due november notes or together the and notes 
we received net proceeds of million that were used to repay borrowings under the bridge facility discussed below 
in connection with the issuance of the and notes  we entered into several interest rate swap contracts to fix a portion of the interest rate 
including the discount and the impact of the swaps  the effective interest rates are approximately for the notes and for the notes 
in connection with the issuance of the and notes  we modified certain financial and operating covenants under the indenture governing the notes 
the and notes are subject to the existing covenants until all senior debt securities outstanding prior to november  are repaid  at which time the and notes will be subject to the modified covenants 
on october   we closed a billion credit facility through a syndicate of banks

the commitments for million of borrowings in chinese renminbi have been received but the facilities are not yet available pending the completion of certain conditions  which we expect to be completed during early based on our public debt ratings  interest on the borrowings under the global line accrues at a variable rate based upon the interbank offered rate in each respective jurisdiction in which the borrowings are outstanding 
the global line has a four year maturity with a month extension option for all currencies except the renminbi  which matures in february on september   we completed the catellus merger as discussed earlier 
concurrent with the consummation of the catellus merger  we entered into the bridge facility with certain lenders 
upon closing  we borrowed billion  the entire amount available under the bridge facility 
the borrowings under the bridge facility mature on september  based on our public debt ratings  interest on the borrowings under the bridge facility generally accrues at a variable rate based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the and notes  borrowings on the global line and sales of certain real estate properties to make payments on the bridge facility  which had an outstanding balance at december  of million

on january   we purchased the remaining ownership interests in each of prologis north american properties funds ii  iii and iv from our fund partner  an affiliate of arcapita 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid cash of million and assumed debt and other liabilities with a fair value of approximately million 
this resulted in an increase in our investment of approximately million 
the cash portion of the acquisition was funded with borrowings under a million term loan agreement that matures on april  and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin 
in february  we finalized and announced the creation of a new property fund  the north american industrial fund  with several institutional investors  which will primarily own recently developed industrial distribution properties in major distribution markets in the united states and canada 
the north american industrial fund  in which we will have an approximate ownership interest  is an open end fund 
the north american industrial fund will be the primary investment vehicle that will acquire our recently developed distribution properties within the united states and canada that meet certain specified criteria 
we will receive property and asset management fees and will also have the potential for incentive performance participation based on investors returns 
in march  we contributed substantially all of the assets and associated liabilities we obtained in the acquisition from arcapita  including the term loan  to the north american industrial fund 
we are committed to offer to contribute substantially all of our stabilized industrial development properties in canada and the united states to the north american industrial fund 
the north american industrial fund has equity commitments aggregating approximately billion  which expire in february 
table of contents we are committed to offer to contribute certain existing industrial distribution properties in the united states and mexico with an estimated aggregate value of million to prologis north american properties fund v prior to offering for contribution or sale to any third party  subject to certain conditions  through december  we are committed to offer to contribute all of our stabilized development properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund as long as the fund has capital to invest 
prologis european properties fund has equity commitments from nine investors through subscription agreements aggregating million the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  of which million the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  was unfunded at december  in addition  we were committed to make additional equity contributions of million the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  
the subscription agreements expire on august  we are committed to offer to contribute all of our stabilized development properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund ii through august prologis japan properties fund ii has equity commitments aggregating million  which expire in august  including commitments of million from us 
these property funds are committed to acquire such properties  subject to certain exceptions  including that the properties meet certain specified leasing and other criteria  and that the property funds have available capital 
we believe that  while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds may be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments  each property fund will have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that we expect to have available during should the property funds choose not to acquire  or not have sufficient capital available to acquire  a property that meets the specified criteria  the rights under the agreement with regard to that specific property will terminate 
there can be no assurance that if these property funds do not continue to acquire the properties that we have available  that we will be able to secure other sources of capital such that we can contribute or sell these properties in a timely manner and continue to generate profits from our development activities in a particular reporting period

the potential obligations under the slcas aggregated million and the combined book value of the assets in the property funds  before depreciation  that are subject to the provisions of slcas was approximately billion at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item distribution and dividend requirements our common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures we will meet the distribution requirements of the code relating to a reit while still allowing us to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than operating income and net earnings 

table of contents cash distributions per common share paid in  and were  and  respectively 
in december  the board approved an increase in the annual distribution for from to per common share 
the payment of common share distributions is dependent upon our financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 
a distribution of per common share for the first quarter of was declared on february  this distribution was paid on february  to holders of common shares on february  we have increased our common share distribution level every year since our common shares became publicly traded in at december   we had three series of preferred shares outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on preferred shares are per series c preferred share  per series f preferred share and per series g preferred share 
pursuant to the terms of our preferred shares  we are restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to our common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage well defined risk associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on existing or anticipated obligations and transactions 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows us to manage the risks of increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the effect these fluctuations would have on our income and cash flows 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had no contracts outstanding 
new accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations ffo is a non gaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry 
the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings 
although nareit has published a definition of ffo  modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits  as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 
ffo  as we define it  is presented as a supplemental financial measure 
we do not use ffo as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of our ability to fund our cash needs 
ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor do we intend it to present  a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance 
we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap 
further  we believe our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 
nareit s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties 
we agree that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on ffo since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with 
table of contents market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo concept for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
we believe financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo 
our defined ffo measure excludes the following items from net earnings computed under gaap that are not excluded in the nareit defined ffo measure i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries  ii certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from certain debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated investees  iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated investees  and iv mark to market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments utilized to manage foreign currency risks 
ffo of our unconsolidated investees is calculated on the same basis 
the items that we exclude from net earnings computed under gaap  while not infrequent or unusual  are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative effects on our results of operations  in inconsistent and unpredictable directions 
most importantly  the economics underlying the items that we exclude from net earnings computed under gaap are not the primary drivers in management s decision making process and capital investment decisions 
period to period fluctuations in these items can be driven by accounting for short term factors that are not relevant to long term investment decisions  long term capital structures or long term tax planning and tax structuring decisions 
accordingly  we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 
real estate is a capital intensive business 
investors analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions 
the adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap that are included in arriving at our ffo measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating our current operating performance 
we believe these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts  potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of our performance on the key measures of net asset value and current operating returns generated on real estate investments 

table of contents while we believe our defined ffo measure is an important supplemental measure  neither nareit s nor our measure of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are  therefore  limited as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo 
ffo is limited  as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets 
further  the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of distribution properties are not reflected in ffo 
gains or losses from property dispositions represent changes in the value of the disposed properties 
by excluding these gains and losses  ffo does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions 
the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our defined ffo measure result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point 
our defined ffo measure does not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement 
the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our defined ffo measure are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time 
the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount 
our ffo measure is limited in that it does not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we compensate for these limitations by using the ffo measure only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap 
to further compensate  we always reconcile our ffo measure to net earnings computed under gaap in our financial reports 
additionally  we provide investors with complete financial statements prepared under gaap  our definition of ffo  which includes a discussion of the limitations of using our non gaap measure  and a reconciliation of our gaap measure net earnings to our non gaap measure ffo  as we define it  so that investors can appropriately incorporate this measure and its limitations into their analyses 
ffo attributable to common shares as defined by us was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reconciliations of ffo attributable to common shares as defined by us to net earnings attributable to common shares computed under gaap are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  ffo reconciliation of net earnings to ffo net earnings attributable to common shares add deduct nareit defined adjustments real estate related depreciation and amortization adjustment to gains recognized on dispositions of certain non cdfs business assets and investment in property fund  net reconciling items attributable to discontinued operations gains recognized on dispositions of non cdfs business assets  net real estate related depreciation and amortization totals discontinued operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency put option contracts  to reduce our foreign currency market risk 
we have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate market risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with polices that have been approved by our board 
we estimate our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis 
we define our market risk exposure as i the potential loss in future earnings and cash flows due to interest rate exposure and ii the potential loss in future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure 
our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective  we borrow on a fixed rate basis for longer term debt issuances 
in anticipation of a financing expected to occur in  we entered into several interest rate swap contracts which were designated as cash flow hedges to fix the interest rate on a portion of the expected financing 
the financing occurred in november with the issuance of million of senior notes 
we have no derivative contracts outstanding at december  as hedges of our future fixed rate debt 
table of contents or our variable lines of credit  although we may in the future fix existing variable rate borrowings to manage our interest rate exposure 
our primary interest rate risk is created by the variable rate lines of credit 
during the year ended december   we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of billion on our variable rate lines of credit 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for the variable rate lines of credit was approximately million of cash flow for the year ended december  the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for and assumed a flat yield curve for the year 
our bridge facility is also a variable rate facility in which we have a market risk of increased rates 
we have a balance on this facility at december  of million  which matures on september  based on a sensitivity analysis with a adverse change in interest rates and assuming no payments made until maturity and a flat yield curve  we believe our estimated market risk exposure for this facility is approximately million on our cash flow for the year ended december  foreign currency risk we incur foreign currency exchange risk related to third party and intercompany debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or investee 
the remeasurement of certain of this debt results in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro  pound sterling and yen 
based on the results of a sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the estimated market risk exposure to future earnings associated with this debt was million at december  we primarily use foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest expense of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees 
at december   we did not have any foreign currency put option contracts outstanding 
we translate to us dollars the income and expenses of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries and our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of our unconsolidated investees recognized under the equity method 
we hedge the foreign currency exchange risk associated with approximately to of the forecasted net operating income from our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees through foreign currency put option contracts 
the effect of the change in foreign currency exchange rates on translated income and expenses of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it when rates go above the option strike rate when rates are below or are expected to be below  there is no offset 
since we hedge approximately to of our projected net operating income from our foreign subsidiaries and investees for foreign currency rate fluctuations above the option strike rate  approximately to of the impact to the net earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and investees of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments
