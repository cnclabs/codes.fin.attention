item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during we acquired two businesses in separate transactions  zamba corporation zamba and proceed north america proceed 
on december  we completed the acquisition of zamba  which strengthened our position in the customer relationship management market 
on october   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with proceed north america llc under which we acquired proceed s business 
proceed is an implementer of sap packaged services 
the operating results of zamba and proceed are included in our results from the dates of their respective acquisitions 
in  we began the year focusing on four industry groups manufacturing  healthcare digital imaging  financial services and consumer retail 
complementing this industry expertise was our emphasis on our core competencies including enterprise application services  customer relationship management crm  and process adoption training 
however  the industry and competency focus proved unsuccessful in increasing revenues sufficiently to cover our costs  accordingly  we implemented a strategic realignment to improve our business and reduce our costs 
the actions included a realignment of service offerings within the industry and competency consulting groups  selective headcount reductions and office closings 
this resulted in a restructuring charge to earnings of million during the quarter ended june  on december   our chief executive officer resigned and our lead director was named chairman and acting chief executive officer 
in addition  on december   we implemented initiatives to further reduce costs 
these cost reductions included headcount reductions  reduction in office space to reflect current needs and the termination of a contract with a vendor 
as a result of these two events  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million during the quarter ended december  we also streamlined our service offerings to four areas sap and peoplesoft enterprise application consulting services  crm and digital healthcare 
in addition to these service offerings  our process adoption training services underlie all these areas in order to facilitate change management and knowledge transfer throughout our implementation processes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we periodically review our recorded goodwill for potential impairment 
we perform this review annually or if an event occurs that we believe may reduce the fair value of an acquisition below its carrying value 
in accordance with this policy  in the second quarter of we reviewed the goodwill we had previously recorded in connection with the proceed acquisition 
based on a termination of a business agreement with a third party  our expected revenues and earnings from the proceed business had declined and  accordingly  we recorded a million charge to recognize impairment of the full amount of proceed goodwill 
in conjunction with the company s policy to annually review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as of december   representing the remaining carrying value of goodwill on the company s books as of that date 
this goodwill had been recorded as part of the zamba acquisition but due to full integration of zamba into the business of the company  the goodwill was evaluated at the enterprise level 
the analysis for potential impairment included a review of current and expected page 
table of contents future operating results 
an independent valuation was performed which included tests of discounted cash flows  market comparables and market capitalization 
based on the impairment analysis  including the independent valuation  we recorded an impairment charge for the full amount of goodwill carrying value as of december  the results of our operations are affected by general economic conditions as well as the level of economic activity and changes in the industries that we serve 
while the general economy and the information technology it consulting services market may be improving  there is no assurance that improving conditions will result in an increase in our future revenues given the fundamental changes in the it service industry as described below 
we believe the information technology services industry continues to undergo fundamental changes  resulting in increasing competitive pressure 
these changes include competition from application software firms as they continue to enhance services and implementation capabilities to increase their revenue  offshore application development and system consulting and support firms which typically have much lower labor costs and billing rates  and the proliferation of enterprise resource planning erp expertise within the it departments of organizations  reducing the need to engage outside consulting services 
the availability of offshore technical expertise has and will continue to have an impact on the it consulting market 
however  we believe the demand for high end value added technically and functionally competent innovative consultants is now growing  particularly in the mid market segment we target 
the complexity of corporate it needs is not diminishing 
our business is also driven by the pace of technological change  our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through specialty services that address targeted industry and business concerns  and the type and level of spending by our clients in the areas in which we provide services 
many factors can result in a deferral  reduction or cancellation of services requested by our prospective or current clients including budget constraints  economic conditions and perceived project progress  success or value 
project personnel costs constitute the majority of our operating costs 
since project personnel costs are primarily driven by the cost of billable personnel  mainly compensation and benefits  maintaining these costs at a reasonable and predictable percentage of revenue is critical to our financial performance 
project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues are driven by utilization and average hourly billing rates 
utilization represents the percentage of time our billable professionals spend on billable work 
it is our strategy to try to match our project personnel supply with demand 
at times this requires us to reduce headcount and reassign employees to other active projects when they are no longer needed on a particular project 
however  because of the mix of skills needed and project duration  implementation of this strategy may be delayed at times 
accordingly  any decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  would have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition  which could be material 
revenues for presentation purposes  we show two components of revenues revenues before reimbursements  which consist of revenue for performing consulting services  and page 
table of contents reimbursements  consisting of reimbursements we receive from clients for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we believe revenues before reimbursements is a more meaningful representation of our economic activity since it excludes pass through  zero margin expense reimbursements 
costs and expenses project personnel project personnel costs consist primarily of professional salaries and benefits 
other project expenses other project expenses consist of the cost for subcontractors hired for use on our client projects and billed to our clients  employee termination costs  and nonreimbursable expenses incurred for client projects and business development 
nonreimbursable expenses include recruiting fees  certain selling expenses and personnel training 
reimbursable expenses reimbursable expenses represent project related and other out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the client 
an equivalent amount is included in revenues under the caption reimbursements 
bad debt expense we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we also analyze our notes receivable  which are included in long term receivables and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
management and administrative support management and administrative support costs consist of client officer costs and infrastructure costs 
client officer costs include client officer salaries and travel  marketing costs and recruiting costs 
client officers are a critical component in our client relationship selling model 
each of our clients has at least one client officer assigned to them 
the client officers are responsible for delivery excellence  client relationship and satisfaction  revenues  utilization  project margins  days sales outstanding and human capital  including recruiting and career development 
in addition  each client officer is also a billable consulting resource 
infrastructure costs include costs related to our senior corporate management and board of directors  accounting  financial reporting  finance  tax  legal  treasury  human resources  employee benefits  marketing  public and investor relations  office operations  staffing of our project personnel  recruiting  training  internal communications  internal technology applications  management of new business opportunities  planning  quality assurance  and risk management 
intangible asset amortization our acquired intangible assets with definite lives  which consist of amounts related to customer relationships  backlog  agreements not to compete and other business agreements  are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in addition  we periodically evaluate these intangible assets to determine whether adjustment to these amounts or estimated useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
page 
table of contents incentive compensation incentive compensation  if any  is accrued at a set percentage of base salary  which varies by level of employee  and is adjusted to reflect the amounts needed for active employees and for performance against targets  goals and objectives 
payments of incentive compensation  if any  are performance based and are determined by both objective financial based and subjective measures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
management also periodically reviews and updates the estimates  as necessary  to reflect current conditions 
if actual amounts or updated estimates are ultimately different from original estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts or updates become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than management reasonably could have used have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from a full range of it business consulting services 
our services are contracted on either a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
for our time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as work is performed  primarily based on hourly billing rates 
for our fixed price contracts  we recognize revenues based on services performed with performance generally assessed on the ratio of hours incurred to date compared to the total estimated hours over the entire contract 
revenues are subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
any revisions in the estimate are charged or credited to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
contracts are performed in phases 
losses on contracts  if any  are reserved in full when determined 
contract losses are determined by the amount by which the estimated cost of the contract exceeds the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
extended support revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful receivables an allowance for doubtful receivables is maintained for potential credit losses 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful receivables  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable on a client by client basis  including customer creditworthiness and current economic trends  and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such page 
table of contents determination is made 
such a change could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided using currently enacted tax rates when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to i the amount of annual income and ii the basis of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have generated certain deferred tax assets as a result of operating losses and temporary differences between book and tax accounting  as well as tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options that were recorded as additional paid in capital in the period of exercise 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if the realization of our deferred tax assets in future periods is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is based on significant estimates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
valuation of stock options and warrants we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
compensation costs for employee stock options are measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
in connection with our acquisition of zamba at the end of  we used the black scholes option pricing model for the valuation of the options and warrants issued in connection with this acquisition 
the black scholes option pricing model requires assumptions as to the expected lives of the options and warrants  expected volatility of our stock price and risk free interest rates 
as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends  the dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangibles that are deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but  instead  are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment annually or if an event occurs or if circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the acquisition below its book value 
the impairment test is conducted utilizing a fair value methodology 
we evaluate the fair value of our acquisitions utilizing various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis 
this implied fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill for the page 
table of contents individual acquisition 
if the fair value is less  we recognize an impairment loss 
in addition  we evaluate the intangible assets with definite lives to determine whether adjustment to these amounts or estimated useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
in accordance with our sfas goodwill impairment review policy  in the second quarter of we analyzed the goodwill we had previously recorded in connection with the proceed acquisition 
based on the termination of a business agreement with a third party  our expected revenues and earnings from the proceed business had declined and  accordingly  we recorded a million charge to recognize impairment of the full amount of proceed goodwill 
also  in conjunction with the company s policy to annually review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as of december   representing the remaining carrying value of goodwill on the company s books as of that date 
this goodwill had been recorded as part of the zamba acquisition but due to full integration of zamba into the business of the company  the goodwill was evaluated at the enterprise level 
the analysis for potential impairment included a review of current and expected future operating results 
an independent valuation was performed which included tests of discounted cash flows  market comparables and market capitalization 
based on the impairment analysis  including the independent valuation  we recorded an impairment charge for the full amount of goodwill carrying value as of december  in the future  we may undertake additional merger and acquisition activity and thereby acquire additional goodwill 
any such goodwill will be the subject of future impairment analyses and  should there be a change in key assumptions about the acquired businesses or general market conditions  additional goodwill impairment charges may be necessary 
any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
restructuring and other charges when industry and market conditions dictate  we realign our business and record accruals for restructuring and other charges as necessary 
these charges mainly relate to severance costs  office reductions and closures  asset write offs and other costs 
the office space reductions  office closures and associated contractual lease obligations are based in part on assumptions and estimates of the timing and amount of sublease rentals 
to the extent estimates of the success of our sublease efforts change in the future  adjustments increasing or decreasing the related accruals will be recognized 
the severance costs represent amounts for identified employees and the asset write offs are determined when the charge is made 
the severance costs and asset write offs are not subject to significant revisions 
compared with revenues consolidated net revenues were million for  an increase of percent from the prior year

management and administrative support costs increased slightly to million in from million for the prior year 
while net costs only increased slightly  labor costs increased million due to additional client officers added during the second half of as well as the acquisition of zamba 
this increase in labor costs was offset by a decrease in termination costs of million  a decrease in placement fees of million  a decrease in marketing expenses of million  and a net decrease in various other costs of million such as legal and other outside service costs 
intangible asset amortization was million for due to the acquisitions of zamba and proceed 
we recorded a total of million in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in in the second quarter of we reviewed the goodwill we had previously recorded in connection with the proceed acquisition 
based on a termination of a business agreement with a third party  our expected revenues and earnings from the proceed business had declined and  accordingly  we recorded a million charge to recognize impairment of the full amount of proceed goodwill 
at that time we also recorded a million impairment of an intangible asset related to proceed

these cost reductions included headcount reductions  reduction in office space to reflect current needs and the termination of a contract with a vendor

compared with revenues consolidated net revenues were million for  a decrease of percent from the prior year 
revenues before reimbursements decreased percent to million from million

this resulted in a one time gain of million as shown in the statement of operations and a decrease in other assets of million 
days sales outstanding increased by days to days at december  as compared to days at december   mainly due to an increased concentration of receivables from larger clients who have longer payment terms with their suppliers 
estimated future cash commitments include various office facilities  property and office equipment under operating leases and other costs that expire at various dates  severance costs relating to restructuring and other charges  committed computer system costs  and an annual commitment for telecommunications

net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  as the line of credit  which was recorded as part of our acquisition of zamba on december   was paid in full 
partially offsetting this amount were proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  were million 
our investment policy is to maintain most of our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid  large money market type funds 
this policy exposes us to short term interest rate fluctuations 
until such time as we are able to generate positive cash flow ie  revenues increase sufficiently to cover operating costs  our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents 
if we are not successful in increasing revenues and eliminating negative cash flows  it could become necessary to raise additional capital to offset losses from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any financing or that  if we were to be successful in finding financing  it would be on favorable terms 
operating results and liquidity  including our ability to raise additional capital if necessary  may be materially and adversely affected by continued low demand for the company s services 
in addition  a number of other factors are set forth above under item a 
risk factors 
impact of inflation and backlog inflation should not have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent we are able to raise our hourly billing rates commensurate with our staff compensation rates 
however  if we are unable to raise our hourly billing rates  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
because the majority of our contracts may be terminated on relatively short notice  we do not consider backlog to be meaningful

options held by non employee directors were not subject to acceleration 
the primary purpose of the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was to enable the company to avoid recognizing future compensation expense associated with these out of the money options upon the adoption of sfas r 
in addition  the compensation committee of the board of directors considered that because these options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value  they were not fully achieving their original objectives of employee retention and incentive compensation

as a result of the modification of the vesting terms of the options 
stock options for all employees  including executive officers  are fully vested as of december   with the exception of the options held by the acting chief executive officer 
the value of the unvested stock options for non employee directors and the acting chief executive officer as of december  was approximately thousand 
accordingly  stock compensation expense in future periods will result from these unvested stock options as well as any new grants issued
