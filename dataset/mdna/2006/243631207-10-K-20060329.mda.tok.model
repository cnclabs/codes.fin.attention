item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company provides interior furnishings to original equipment manufacturers of manufactured housing and recreational vehicles and to the hospitality market 
this interior furnishing market is highly competitive 
the company faces risk as the demand for its products is affected by the industry demand in the three markets that the company serves 
any significant decline in the demand for manufactured housing  recreational vehicles  or hospitality accommodations can adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
a large amount of the company s sales are to a relatively few recreational vehicle and manufactured housing customers 
in  the company s top customers accounted for approximately of net sales  as opposed to in the loss of a large customer can have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
in  with the completion of a supply agreement with fleetwood enterprises  the company is under contract to be the exclusive supplier of fleetwood s interior furnishings through at least january fleetwood represented of the company s net sales in fleetwood operates in both the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries 
in august  the company purchased a facility in phoenix  arizona to manufacture product for customers located in the western united states 
this facility has enabled the company to better supply fleetwood s west coast operations and also to solicit new customers 
the company faces the risk that its furnishings could be provided by companies with cheaper labor sources  such as from asian sources 
however  the lack of sufficient lead times from its customers  as well as the customized nature of many of the company s products  presents a substantial barrier to entry for overseas firms 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the recreational vehicle market experienced a slight overall increase in total industry shipments of motor homes and travel trailers have increased from  in to  in  exclusive of  emergency living units in connection with the hurricanes 
travel trailer shipments by the rv industry increased in when compared to however  industry shipment of motor homes decreased by in the reduction in the company s sales to the rv industry was directly related to lower production of travel trailers and motor homes by its customers 
the manufactured housing market has been relatively flat since industry shipments in were about  compared to the  shipments in however  the shipments reported by the manufactured housing industry included a surge in the fourth quarter due to fema living units from the hurricanes 
without these shipments  industry production for had been up about for the first three quarters of excluding the fema production  sales by the manufactured housing industry for all of was virtually flat when compared to sales to the hospitality industry increased about during when compared to the previous year 
hospitality sales are affected by demand for hospitality accommodations and the growth of the industry 
this was the highest volume of annual sales experienced by the company to this market

some of the accounting policies require it to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable and inventory 
the company reviews its accounts receivable portfolio frequently  assessing any past due accounts for collectability 
physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s manufacturing facilities at least quarterly  and inventories are assessed for any slow moving or obsolete items  which constitutes the main judgment necessary in valuing the inventory 
reserves for both receivables and inventory are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as required 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other assumptions the company faces are the assessment of goodwill  intangible asset  and long lived assets for impairment  the calculation of the provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company believes that its assumptions in relation to its critical accounting policies have been reasonably accurate  and does not foresee any future material changes in its estimates or assumptions 
liquidity and financial resources working capital at december  was  compared to  at january  the current ratio was at year end compared to at year end the liquid ratio was at year end compared to at year end the long term debt ratio was at december  compared to a year earlier 
net accounts receivable increased  at december   when compared to january  accounts receivable increased due to the increase in sales to the recreational vehicle market in the fourth quarter of compared to  as well as an increased percentage of sales to the company s hospitality customers 
days sales outstanding dso increased from days at the end of fiscal to days at the end of fiscal the reason for this increase was mostly an increased proportion of sales to the hospitality market  which historically have a higher dso than the other two markets that the company serves 
in january  the company began assigning certain account receivables under a receivables servicing and credit approved receivables purchasing agreement with cit group commercial services inc only receivables from sales to the hospitality industry may be assigned to cit 
under the agreement cit provides credit checking  credit approval  and collection responsibilities for the assigned receivables 
if cit approves an order from a hospitality customer and the resulting receivables are not paid or disputed by the customer within ninety days of sale  cit will pay the receivable to the company and assume ownership of the receivable 
cit begins collection efforts for the assigned receivables both approved and not approved when they are due hospitality sales are made on net terms 
approved receivables were approximately  at december  hospitality customers are instructed to make payments directly to cit and cit then wires collected funds to the company 
the company pays cit six tenths of a percent of all assigned receivables 
management believes this cost will be mostly offset by reductions in bad debt expense and collection costs 
the company entered into this arrangement to take advantage of cit s extensive credit checking and collection capabilities 
management believes this arrangement has improved liquidity 
net inventories increased  at december   when compared to january  the increase in inventories was due to increased levels of fourth quarter business activity  principally in the recreational vehicle and hospitality markets 
capital expenditures for were  compared to  in  excluding the assets acquired from fleetwood 
the expenditures included  for land  building  and equipment for the opening of the company s phoenix  arizona facility 
at this time  capital spending for is expected to be in excess of  including approximately  for new properties and expansion 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company had no borrowings at year end under its  revolving line of credit 
the company does expect to use its line of credit during in addition  the company expects to use a term loan to fund the real estate additions and expansions

most of the increase is attributable to a decision to convert the company s erp system to a different software platform 
impairment of the old system resulted in a one time  pretax charge

increased commission expense due to increased hospitality industry sales was also another major reason for the increase 
interest  investment and other income remained flat at  in  while interest expense decreased  or

sales to the hospitality market increased 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was in versus in the major reasons for the increase in this percentage were the higher costs of production at the facility acquired from fleetwood and the transition costs incurred by the company to re distribute most of the acquired business to its other facilities

management reviews significant variations or changing trends with general managers 
if necessary  appropriate actions are taken to address issues 
selling and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses fell from to 
the dollar increase is due mostly to the amortization of the intangible asset from the fleetwood acquisition  increased personnel costs due to company growth  fees resulting from the company s credit servicing agreement  and professional fees arising from labor efficiency studies 
the percentage decrease is due to fixed expenses being spread over a larger sales volume 
interest  investment and other income decreased to  in  while interest expense increased  or 
these changes resulted primarily from lower cash balances during due to the use of cash and the line of credit to pay for the acquisition of the fleetwood drapery operation  higher than normal capital expenditures  and accrued interest expense on inventory acquired from fleetwood 
net income was  in compared to  in net income as a percent of sales decreased to in compared to in ebitda ebitda represents income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization and is an approximation of cash flow from operations before tax 
the company uses ebitda as an internal measure of performance and believes it is a useful and commonly used measure of financial performance in addition to income before taxes and other profitability measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ebitda is not a measure of performance under gaap 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income and income before taxes as an indicator of the company s operations in accordance with gaap 
nor is ebitda an alternative to cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
the company s definition of ebitda can differ from that of other companies

projected interest rates on variable interest rate obligations are the interest rates in effect as of december  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further information about uncertainties from fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces minimum potential market risk in its long term debt 
the company had four separate long term debt agreements outstanding as of december  the company faces the risk that if market interest rates increase  the two interest rate obligations of the company with a variable interest rate would require higher payments of interest 
as of december   the bond secured by the company s goshen  indiana property of  had a variable interest rate of per annum 
each increase of could increase interest expense by approximately  in and lower amounts in successive years as principal is paid down  terminating in also  the  bond on the company s bloomsburg  pennsylvania property had a variable interest rate of at december  each increase of in market rates could cause an increase in interest expense of less than  in and lower amounts in successive years as principal is paid down  terminating in interest rates are exclusive of letter of credit fees paid to third parties to guarantee the payment of these obligations  which fees are or less  and are not subject to increase 
the company believes the risks associated with its fixed rate obligations are minimal  as the company believes the current rates approximate current market rates  and that the current market rates are unlikely to go significantly lower 
should market interest rates rise significantly  the company would benefit in that it would have locked in a lower fixed rate that will remain in effect for the life of the loan
