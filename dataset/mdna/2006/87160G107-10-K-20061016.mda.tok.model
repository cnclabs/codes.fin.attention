md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business and the industries in which we operate 
our business strategy a description of the strategic initiatives on which we focus and the goals we seek to achieve

use of estimates and critical accounting policies a description of critical accounting policies including those that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our business the company designs  manufacturers and markets medical devices for use in ophthalmic and vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgery 
its products are designed and manufactured to support micro or minimally invasive surgical procedures 
in addition to such surgical devices and equipment  we also design and manufacture disposable and non disposable supplies and accessories for use with such devices and equipment 
for a more detailed description  see item business overview 
we sell our products primarily to hospitals  clinics and surgeons in approximately countries 
sales outside the united states are primarily through local distributors 
as used in this discussion  the company or synergetics usa means the company and its subsidiaries 
new product sales the company s business strategy has been  and is expected to continue to be  the development and marketing of new technologies for the ophthalmic surgery and neurosurgery markets 
new products  which management defines as products available for sale within the prior month period  accounted for approximately of total sales for the company for fiscal  approximately million 
for fiscal  new products accounted for approximately of total sales for the company  or just over million 
this growth was primarily in our capital equipment products both in the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
synergetics past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new technologies introduced by synergetics 
since august   synergetics has introduced new products to the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
we expect adoption rates for the company s new products in the future to have a similar effect on its operating performance 
growth in minimally invasive surgery procedures minimally invasive surgery is surgery performed without making a major incision or opening 
minimally invasive surgery generally results in less trauma for the patient  less likelihood of complications related to the incision and a shorter recovery time 
a growing number of surgical procedures are performed using minimally invasive techniques  creating a multi million dollar market for the specialized devices used in the procedures 
the company has benefited from the overall growth in this market and expects to continue to benefit as it continues to introduce new and improved technologies targeting this market  such as its and gauge instrumentation and photon tm ii gas arc light source for the ophthalmic surgical market and our new electrosurgical generator  the malis advantage tm 
demand trends volume and mix improvements contributed to the majority of sales growth for the company during the fiscal years ended july   and ophthalmic and neurosurgical procedures volume on a global basis continues to rise at an estimated growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
in addition  the demand for high quality products and new technologies  such as the company s innovative instruments and disposables  to support growth in procedures volume continues to positively impact growth 
the company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the ophthalmic and neurosurgery market 
pricing trends through its strategy of delivering new and higher quality technologies  the company has been generally able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pressure in the healthcare industry 
competition in the medical device markets and governmental healthcare cost containment efforts  particularly in the united states  have negatively impacted the prices medical device manufacturers received for their products 
the company should be less impacted by this negative pressure than other manufacturers in the industry because its products are primarily used for non discretionary  life or eyesight threatening procedures 
our business strategy our goal is to become a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of precision engineered  microsurgical instruments  capital equipment and devices for use in vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgical applications and to grow our product lines in other specialty surgical markets 
our recent combination of the businesses of valley forge and synergetics is a significant component of our strategy toward achieving these goals 
our strategy includes introducing new technology that can be easily differentiated from our competition by capitalizing on our combined successes in delivering minimally invasive products that enable concentrated application to a surgical area with decreased impact beyond the specific desired surgical effects  resulting in improved recovery times and shorter hospital stays  identifying microsurgical niches that may offer the prospect for substantial growth and higher profit margins that allow us an opportunity to build upon our existing technologies  such as expanding the use of our products in ent ear  nose and throat  spine surgery  plastic surgery and other forms of microsurgery  accelerating our international including canada growth by continuing to build on our recent successes supported by valley forge s long established relationships and reputation in global markets  utilizing the full breadth and depth of knowledge  experience and resources in our research and development department to deliver precision engineered capital equipment  instruments and disposables based on our own proprietary technologies and innovations  branding and marketing a substantial portion of our neurosurgical products with the malis trademark  continuing to develop our distribution channels by hiring direct territory managers and independent sales agents to assure that our products and their associated benefits are seen by those making or influencing the purchasing decisions  continuing to grow our disposables revenue stream by focusing on the development of a full offering of disposable adjuncts  such as instruments  adapters and fiber optics  to our capital equipment offerings and emphasizing disposables designed to eliminate hospital repair costs and minimize patient to patient disease transfer  introducing the malis advantage tm with our new proprietary single use  hand switching bipolar instruments with enhanced features and functionality to expand the array of procedures they are designed to perform  expanding the use of the malis advantage tm into other surgical markets as its increased power and functionality allows the surgeon to perform functions similar to traditional monopolar systems  without the inherent safety limitations  expanding the use of the sonopet omni  our ultrasonic aspirator  into other surgical markets as its torsional bone cutting capability allows the surgeon to perform delicate procedures safely  and exploring opportunities for growth through strategic partnering with other companies with complimentary products and technologies to facilitate strategic growth in our defined niche markets  such as our current relationships with codman  stryker and quantel 
results of operations the merger of synergetics and valley forge was accounted for as a reverse merger  and as such  the company is reporting the financial results of synergetics as the accounting acquirer in the merger  together with the financial results of valley forge for the period september  through july  as a result  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the periods set forth below reflects the effect of the combination of synergetics and valley forge  which was consummated on september  also  in conjunction with the merger  we started to operate in two distinct business segments based on the types of products sold 
the synergetics segment includes our ophthalmic and neurosurgical instruments and omni ultrasonic aspirators 
the valley forge segment is comprised of our bipolar electrosurgical generators 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales the following table presents net sales by medical field dollars in thousands year ended july  increase synergetics ophthalmic neurosurgery valley forge  neurosurgery  n m total for  this tabular information reflects synergetics results only and does not reflect the effect of the combination of synergetics and valley forge 
for  this tabular information reflects the net sales of valley forge from september  through july  valley forge s sales for the twelve months ended june  were approximately million 
the percentage increase over the pro forma numbers would have been 
n m not meaningful 
ophthalmic sales growth was led by continued growth in sales of products in synergetics core technology areas of instruments and illumination 
when comparing neurosurgery  net sales of synergetics during the fiscal year ended were greater than sales  primarily attributable to the sales in the core technology area of power ultrasonic aspirators and related disposables 
we expect that photon tm ii  the vitra tm and omni sales will continue to have a positive impact on net sales in fiscal in addition  we anticipate that the positive effects of the malis advantage tm will begin to impact our revenues meaningfully during the second fiscal quarter of the following table presents national and international net sales dollars in thousands year ended july  increase united states synergetics united states valley forge  n m international including canada total for  this tabular information reflects synergetics results only and does not reflect the effect of the combination of synergetics and valley forge 
for  this tabular information reflects the net sales of valley forge from september  through july  valley forge s sales for the twelve months ended june  were approximately million 
the percentage increase over the pro forma numbers would have been 
n m not meaningful 
international sales growth was primarily attributable to the sales in core technology areas of illumination and power ultrasonic aspirators and related disposables 
the omni power ultrasonic aspirator received the ce mark during the third quarter of this fiscal year thus allowing the company to begin selling these medical devices internationally 
in addition  we anticipate that the positive effects of the malis advantage tm and the addition of its ce mark will be fully reflected in operations during the second fiscal quarter of during fiscal  the company added distributors covering countries to its international neurosurgery sales force due to the addition of the omni and the anticipated release of the malis advantage tm 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in the growth in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from to was attributable primarily to the royalty payments received from codman for the use of the malis tradename offset by an additional  charge to the company s earnings 
during fiscal  the company completed a review of all of its purchased inventory and a substantial portion of its manufactured products in response to a material weakness identified in the prior year 
the company also completed a review of the complete inventory process as part of its compliance with the provisions of sarbanes oxley and identified another weakness 
the company has updated its inventory system and implemented additional controls including monitoring processes and procedures to correct both weaknesses 
the company has analyzed the additional amount charged to earnings during the fourth quarter and has determined that the impact of the charge was not material to prior year nor to any individual quarter of fiscal however  note to the audited financial statements describes the impact to the individual quarters 
operating expenses research and development r d as a percentage of net sales was and for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
r d costs increased to  in from  in  reflecting not only an increase in spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance such as the malis advantage tm and the photon tm ii  but also  in r d for the former valley forge 
the company s product development pipeline included over active  major projects in various stages of completion at july  the company has strategically targeted r d spending as a percentage of net sales to be consistent with what management believes to be an average range for the industry 
the company expects over the next few years to invest in r d at a rate of approximately to of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by  during the fiscal year ended july  and as a percentage of net sales was for the fiscal year ended july  as compared to for the fiscal year ended july  selling expenses  which consist of salaries and commissions  the largest component of sg a  increased approximately million to million  or of sales  for the fiscal year ended july   compared to million  or of sales for the fiscal year ended july  however  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from of sales for fiscal to of sales for fiscal this percentage decrease was due to the fact that sales from the former valley forge require essentially no sales people because of the oem nature of its product line 
the increase in sg a was also impacted by the inclusion of approximately million of sg a for the former valley forge 
general and administrative headcount increased by approximately from july   which resulted in an increase in other costs of approximately million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal legal fees increased by  in addition to the internal costs associated with the company s sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  the company also recorded approximately  in external audit and consulting expense 
the costs of the company s sarbanes oxley efforts will continue to be expensed through the remainder of the first quarter of fiscal also  during fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r which requires compensation expense to be recognized in the financial statements 
the company had previously followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation apb no 
and related interpretation in accounting for its employee stock options 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized  if the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
the impact of sfas r was approximately  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award calculated using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
the company will continue to grant options to its independent directors but has begun to use restricted stock to provide incentive compensation for its employees 
as of july   the future compensation cost expected to be recognized under sfas r is approximately  in   in   in and  in however  the major portion of our compensation cost arises from our stock option grants to our directors which is recognized when the options are granted as they are immediately exercisable 
these options will be granted to the directors who are elected or re elected after the annual meeting 
other expense other expense for the fiscal year increased to  from  for the fiscal year ended july  the increase was due primarily to increased interest expense on the note payable to the estate of dr 
malis and increased borrowings on the working capital line due to working capital needs during the fiscal year

these shares were counted as outstanding for days during the fiscal year ended july  therefore  basic weighted average shares outstanding increased from  to  segment reporting in conjunction with the reverse merger  the company now operates in two business segments the synergetics segment and the valley forge segment 
the synergetics segment includes revenue and operating expenses associated with the sales of ophthalmic and neurosurgical instruments and omni ultrasonic aspirators 
the valley forge segment includes revenue and operating expenses associated with the sales of bipolar electrosurgical generators 
the financial results of valley forge have been included from september  the synergetics segment generated net sales of million  an increase of million or 
net sales growth was led by sales of products in synergetics core technology areas of instruments  illumination and power ultrasonic aspirators including the related disposables 
operating income for the segment increased from million to million 
the increase in operating income was primarily the result of million in additional sales offset by a lower gross profit margin and approximately  in additional r d and million in additional sg a

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting polices which require management s judgment are discussed below 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of synergetics usa and its wholly owned subsidiaries synergetics  synergetics ip  inc and synergetics development company  llc 
all significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated 
revenue recognition the company records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery to the carrier has occurred  and collectibility is reasonably ensured 
freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales 
service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the service has been completed 
revenue from license and royalty fees are recorded when earned 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
the company s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently 
thus  the company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not been valued or for items that have not had their values updated recently 
in addition  the company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly 
its evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future cost valuations  future demand or market conditions are different from the company s projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
loss contingencies the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business  including claims by employees or former employees  with respect to its products and involving commercial disputes 
the company s financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which it is currently a party because management currently believes that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  and are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
however  it is possible that the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies if management changes its assessment of the likely outcome of these matters 
amortization periods the company records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if the company s assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company records an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that management reasonably expects to collect 
for all other customers  the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and its historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  the company may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
patents and research and development incremental legal and other costs to obtain the patent are capitalized to a patent asset 
salaries  benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in research and development costs 
patents are amortized to operations under the straight line method over the remaining statutory life of the patent 
goodwill and other intangibles absent any impairment indicators  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the company will perform its impairment tests at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter 
management analyzed the valuation of our recent acquisition by utilizing current business operations and a market multiple method 
based on this analysis  we believe the enterprise value of our acquisition continues to be greater than our investment 
as a result  we have determined that no impairment of our goodwill has occurred 
while the annual impairment tests did not indicate goodwill impairment  we would be subject to future impairment if the operating results and cash flows of our recent acquisition would not support the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill 
intangibles assets  consisting of patents  licensing agreements and proprietary know how are amortized to operations under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or statutory lives whichever is shorter 
these periods range from two to ten years 
the life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark 
the company intends to use the trademark indefinitely  and therefore  its useful life is not limited to any specific product 
the trademark constitutes an indefinite lived intangible that will be used in perpetuity 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
deferred tax assets and liabilities the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when a determination is made that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation as of august   sfas r became effective for the company 
the company had previously followed apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized if the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
under sfas r  compensation expense is now recognized 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
compensation expense is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
of the inputs into the black scholes option pricing model  the one that can impact the value of the options the most is the volatility factor 
the company has utilized in this calculation 
the company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  an entity uses the fair value based accounting method for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date 
as of the effective date  compensation costs related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of that date are based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  that is  an entity would not remeasure the grant date fair value estimate of the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
recent accounting pronouncements information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the audited financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 
the company has a revolving credit facility and an equipment line of credit facility in place 
the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of million at july  bearing interest at libor plus 
the equipment line of credit facility had an outstanding balance of  at july   bearing interest at an effective interest rate at the prime rate 
interest expense from these credit facilities is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming the current levels of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point increase in the average interest rate on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased by approximately  the company does not perform any interest rate hedging activities related to these two facilities 
additionally  the company has exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through export sales to international accounts 
as only approximately of our sales revenue is denominated in foreign currencies  we estimate that a change in the relative strength of the dollar to foreign currencies would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company does not conduct any hedging activities related foreign currency
