as is customary in the cosmetics industry  our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested  authorized and approved

in recognition of this practice  and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we report sales on a net basis  which is computed by deducting the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns from gross sales 
as a percentage of gross sales  returns were in fiscal and in fiscal and customers our strategy has been to build strong strategic relationships with selected retailers globally

marketing our marketing strategy is built around our vision statement bringing the best to everyone we touch 
mrs 
est e lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide high quality service and products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base 
our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products 
each of our brands is distinctively positioned  has a single global image  and is promoted with consistent logos  packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands 
we regularly advertise our products on television and radio  in upscale magazines and newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports 
in addition  our products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide 
promotional activities and in store displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and to attract new consumers 
our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers  some of which are supported by coordinated promotions  such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase 
at in store counters  sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application 
we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program 
we believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers 
starting with the launch of the clinique website in  we have used the internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands 
currently  we have seventeen single brand marketing sites  eleven of which have e commerce capabilities  and gloss 
com  our majority owned  multi brand marketing and e commerce site 
most of our creative marketing work is done by in house creative teams 
the creative staff designs and produces the sales materials  advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand 
global net advertising  merchandising  sampling and promotional expenditures were  million   million and  million for fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts include revenues and expenses relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales 
our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale 
these include est e lauder beauty advisors  clinique consultants  aramis selling specialists  prescriptives analysts  origins guides and m a c makeup artists 
information systems information systems support business processes including product development  marketing  sales  order processing  production  distribution and finance 
of the many systems currently being utilized  the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer  or plan to offer  which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality  ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie  sell through data  increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development  manufacturing and marketing strategies  iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers  allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically  with minimal paperwork  and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements  facilitating inventory control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches 
the efficiencies provided by these systems have resulted in increased sales  fewer out of stocks and reduced retail inventories 
we expect that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short and medium terms 
as part of our long term effort to enhance these efficiencies  we are implementing our strategic modernization initiative smi  which includes an enterprise wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data  processes and technologies  which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands  operating units and sales affiliates 
the implementation of smi at our aveda operating unit is planned for fiscal smi is expected to proceed in stages through fiscal research and development we believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products 
marketing  product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences  develop new products and redesign or reformulate existing products 
in addition  research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations 
we maintain ongoing research and development programs at our facilities in melville  new york  oevel  belgium  petersfield  uk  tokyo  japan  markham  ontario  blaine  minnesota  shanghai  china  and colombes  france 
as of june   we had approximately employees engaged in research and development 
research and development expenditures  which are included in advertising  merchandising and sampling expenditures  totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our research and development group makes significant contributions toward improving existing products and developing new products and provides ongoing technical assistance and know how to our manufacturing activities 
the research and development group has had long standing working relationships with several us and international medical and educational facilities  which supplement internal capabilities 
we do not conduct animal testing of our products 
manufacturing  warehousing and raw materials we manufacture skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products in the united states  belgium  switzerland  the united kingdom  canada and france 
we continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation  increase efficiencies and reduce costs 
our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one type of product eg  lipsticks for all of the principal brands 
our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated 
while we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements  we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and productivity 
to capitalize on innovation and other supply benefits  we continue to utilize third parties on a global basis for finished goods production 
we have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels 
we are continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical distribution network 
we intend to establish regional inventory centers strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate timely delivery of our products to our customers 
the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils  alcohol and specialty chemicals 
we also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications 
procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our centralized supplier relations department 
a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing costs  increasing innovation and improving quality 
as a result of sourcing initiatives  there is increased dependency on certain suppliers  but we believe that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption of supply 
we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add or delete suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business 
we have  in the past  been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products 
as we integrate acquired brands  we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve manufacturing performance 
competition the skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world 
brand recognition  quality  performance and price have a significant influence on consumers choices among competing products and brands 
advertising  promotion  merchandising  the pace and timing of new product introductions  line extensions and the quality of in store sales staff also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions 
we compete against a number of manufacturers and marketers of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products  some of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
our principal competitors among manufacturers and marketers of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products include l oreal sa  which markets lanc me  ralph lauren  giorgio armani  garnier  l oreal  maybelline  biotherm  helena rubinstein  redken  matrix  kiehl s since  shu uemura  skinceuticals  the body shop and other brands  unilever nv  which markets dove  pond s  thermasilk  vaseline intensive care and other brands  the procter gamble company  which markets sk ii  cover girl  olay  giorgio beverly hills  hugo boss  rochas  escada  lacoste  max factor  pantene  clairol  wella  valentino  gucci  sebastian  aussie  dolce gabbana and other brands  beiersdorf ag  which markets nivea  eucerin  la prairie  juvena and other brands  avon products inc  a direct marketer of avon color  anew  skin so soft  mark  avon wellness  becoming  and other products  shiseido company  ltd  which markets shiseido  cl de peau beaut  zirh  nars  decl or  issey miyake  jean paul gaultier  helene curtis  za  carita  aupres and other brands  lvmh mo t hennessey louis vuitton lvmh  which markets christian dior  kenzo  givenchy  guerlain  benefit  make up for ever  fresh  aqua di parma and other brands  coty  inc  which markets lancaster  davidoff  isabella rossellini  rimmel  astor  adidas  the healing garden  chopard  jennifer lopez  kenneth cole  marc jacobs  sarah jessica parker  david and victoria beckham  stetson  calvin klein  cerruti  vera wang and other brands  revlon  inc  which markets revlon  almay  ultima ii and other brands  chanel  inc  clarins sa  which markets clarins  azzaro  thierry mugler and other brands  elizabeth arden  inc  which markets elizabeth arden  elizabeth taylor fragrances  geoffrey beene  halston  britney spears  prevage  badgley mischka  alfred sung  hummer  nanette lepore  cynthia rowley  lulu guinness  bob mackie and other brands  and kao corporation  which markets sofina  sensai  kanebo  molton brown  twany  lissage  est  rmk  lunasol  biore  jergens  john frieda and other brands 
we also face competition from a number of independent doctor aligned brands  such as nv perricone nv  dr 
brandt  murad  prevage md  ddf  md skincare  cosmedicine  strivectin  kinerase and obagi 
additionally  some retailers have developed their own beauty brands  such as gap inc  which markets the gap  old navy and banana republic products  limited brands inc  which markets victoria s secret beauty and bath and body works  and sephora

seasonality our results of operations in total  by region and by product category  are subject to seasonal fluctuations  with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year

item a 
risk factors 
there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 
please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form k and in our subsequent filings with the sec 
our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial 
if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations  as well as the prices of our securities  may be adversely affected 
the beauty business is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 
we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world  including multinational consumer product companies 
some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us 
competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products  innovation  perceived value  service to the consumer  promotional activities  advertising  special events  new product introductions  electronic commerce initiatives and other activities 
it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas 
also  the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade  particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe  has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers  including large format retailers  who have increased their bargaining strength 
this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers 
a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us 
our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands  our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel  the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network  and our ability to protect our intellectual property 
our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 
our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 
our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and cost effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products 
we must continually work to develop  produce and market new products  maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands  achieve a favorable mix of products  and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products 
while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape  analyze and respond to consumer preferences  we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for cosmetics products and changing consumer demands  our financial results will suffer 
our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long term strategy 
our long term strategy is based on five strategic imperatives optimize brand portfolio strengthen product categories strengthen and expand geographic presence diversify and strengthen distribution channels achieve operational and cost excellence achieving our long term objectives may require investment in new brands  categories  distribution channels  technologies and geographic markets 
these investments may results in short term costs without any current revenues 
in addition  there may be costs incurred in disposing of brands 
although we believe that our strategic imperatives will lead to growth in revenue and profitability  we may not realize in full  or in part  the anticipated benefits 
the failure to realize benefits  which may be due to our ability to execute plans or other risks described in this k  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
any future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 
we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings  our distribution channels  increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities 
the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness  dilute the interests of our stockholders or both 
acquisitions may entail numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products  including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  and risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 
our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 
a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items  which could adversely affect our financial results 
the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  inflation  interest rates  energy costs  and consumer confidence generally  all of which are beyond our control 
consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods  when disposable income is lower  and may impact sales of our products 
in addition  sudden disruptions in business conditions  for example  as a consequence of events such as the outbreak of sars in or those that are currently taking place in the middle east  or as a result of a terrorist attack  retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation  or as a result of adverse weather conditions  such as hurricane katrina  can have a short and  sometimes  long term impact on consumer spending 
events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and or purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business  which is a significant contributor to our overall results 
a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales 
changes in laws  regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 
our business is subject to numerous laws  regulations and policies 
changes in the laws  regulations and policies  including the interpretation or enforcement thereof  that affect  or will affect  our business  including changes in accounting standards  tax laws and regulations  trade rules and customs regulations  and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings  and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 
our success depends  in part  on the quality and safety of our products 
our success depends  in part  on the quality and safety of our products 
if our products are found to be defective or unsafe  or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers standards  our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer  the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished  and we could lose sales and or become subject to liability claims  any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends  in part  on our key personnel 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to retain our key personnel  including our executive officers and senior management team 
the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business 
our success also depends  in part  on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified personnel 
competition for these employees can be intense 
we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
this risk may be exacerbated by uncertainties associated with our long term strategy  smi as defined below and other initiatives 
we are subject to risks related to our international operations 
we operate on a global basis  with approximately of our fiscal net sales generated outside the united states 
we maintain offices in over countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture  warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world 
foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which can affect our results of operations  the value of our foreign assets  the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets  and the cost of certain inventory and non inventory items required in our operations  changes in foreign laws  regulations and policies  including restrictions on trade  import and export license requirements  and tariffs and taxes  as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment  and adverse weather conditions  social and geopolitical conditions  such as terrorist attacks  war or other military action 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 
as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale  we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities  including industrial accidents  environmental events  strikes and other labor disputes  disruptions in logistics or information systems  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites  product quality control  safety  licensing requirements and other regulatory issues  as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control 
if such an event were to occur  it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 
our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks 
we have information systems that support our business processes  including product development  marketing  sales  order processing  production  distribution  finance and intracompany communications throughout the world 
we have e commerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries 
these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
despite the implementation of network security measures  our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering 
the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 
as part of a program that we call our strategic modernization initiative  or smi  we are implementing enterprise wide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data  processes and technologies  which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands  operating units and sales affiliates 
the implementation of smi at our aveda operating unit is planned for fiscal the full implementation of smi is not expected until failure to implement smi as planned  in terms of timing  specifications and or costs  could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the price of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of analysts or others predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 
our business planning process is designed to maximize the long term strength  growth and profitability of the company  not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter 
we believe that this longer term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders 
however  we do recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to what we think will be our future net sales and earnings 
accordingly  when we announced our year end financial results for fiscal  we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending june  and the quarter ending september  while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter  we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward looking statements at such times or otherwise 
in all of our public statements when we make  or update  a forward looking statement about our sales and or earnings expectations  we accompany such statements directly  or by reference to a public document  with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect 
such a list is included  among other places  in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg  in our reports on form k and form q 
these and other factors make it more difficult for outside observers  such as research analysts  to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 
outside analysts  like all investors  have the right to make their own predictions as to what the company s financial results will be in a given fiscal year or quarter or even in future years 
outside analysts  however  have access to no more material information about the company s plans than any other public investor  and the company does not endorse their predictions as to our future performance 
nor does the company assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from the company s own internal expectations 
when the company announces actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting  the market price of the company s securities could be affected 
investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to the company s securities do so at their own risk 
the company takes no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of the company s securities 
item b

item legal proceedings 
we are involved  from time to time  in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business 
management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
however  management s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges  juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings 
on march   the united states district court for the northern district of california entered into a final judgment approving the settlement agreement we entered into in july with the plaintiffs  the other manufacturer defendants as defined below and the department store defendants as defined below in a consolidated class action lawsuit that had been pending in the superior court of the state of california in marin county since on april   notices of appeal were filed by representatives of two members of the purported class of consumers 
one of those appeals has since been withdrawn 
if the appeal is resolved satisfactorily  the final judgment will result in the plaintiffs claims being dismissed  with prejudice  in their entirety in both the federal and california actions 
there has been no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by us in this lawsuit 
we entered into the settlement agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation 
in connection with the settlement agreement  the defendants  including the company  will provide consumers with certain free products and pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees 
to meet its obligations under the settlement  we took a special pre tax charge of million  or million after tax  equal to 
per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal at june   the remaining accrual balance was million 
the charge did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
in the federal action  the plaintiffs  purporting to represent a class of all us residents who purchased prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department stores groups that sold such products in the united states the department store defendants  alleged that the department store defendants  the company and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics the manufacturer defendants conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige cosmetics products sold by the department store defendants in violation of state and federal laws

in  the state sued other prps including hickey s carting  inc  dennis c 
hickey and maria hickey  collectively the hickey parties  in the us district court for the eastern district of new york to recover such costs in connection with the site  and in september  the hickey parties brought contribution actions against the company and other blydenburgh prps 
these contribution actions seek to recover  among other things  any damages for which the hickey parties are found liable in the state s lawsuit against them  and related costs and expenses  including attorneys fees 
in june  the state added the company and other prps as defendants in its pending case against the hickey parties 
in april  the company and other defendants added numerous other parties to the case as third party defendants 
the company and certain other prps have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful 
settlement negotiations with the new third party defendants  the state  the company and other defendants began in july we have accrued an amount which we believe would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter 
if settlement discussions are not successful  we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims 
while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome  management believes that the resolution of the blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition

the plaintiff sought injunctive relief  restitution  and general  special and punitive damages for alleged violations of the california unfair competition law  the california false advertising law  and for negligent and intentional misrepresentation

e during fiscal  there was an increase of approximately million in interest expense  net and a corresponding decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
additionally  in connection with this pronouncement  redeemable preferred stock was reclassified as a component of total debt subsequent to june  and all subsequent applicable periods 
f in april  we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting unit that marketed and sold stila brand products 
in february  we sold the assets and operations of our former reporting unit that sold jane brand products 
as a result  all consolidated statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented has been restated for comparative purposes to reflect those reporting units as discontinued operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june  and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  pension and other post retirement benefit costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  derivatives and stock based compensation 
management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership  including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods 
in the americas region  sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and  in the europe  middle east africa and asia pacific regions  sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt 
in certain circumstances  transfer of title takes place at the point of sale eg  at our retail stores 
sales are reported on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received  discounts  incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns 
our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer 
as a percentage of gross sales  returns were in fiscal and in fiscal and our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns  estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels 
consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations 
experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period  as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events 
the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered  and will continue to consider  include  but are not limited to  the solvency of our customers  store closings by retailers  changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 
concentration of credit risk an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers 
the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration 
during fiscal  federated department stores  inc acquired the may department stores company  resulting in the merger of our previous two largest customers 
this customer sells products primarily within north america and accounted for  million  or  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and million  or  of our accounts receivable at june  although management believes that this customer and our other major customers are sound and creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows and or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of million and million as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million and million for customer deductions and write offs in fiscal  and  respectively  and increased by million  million and million for additional provisions in fiscal  and  respectively 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products  promotional products  raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
pension and other post retirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trust based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan us qualified plan and an unfunded  nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan  the domestic plans  a contributory defined contribution plan  international pension plans  which vary by country  consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  deferred compensation  and certain other post retirement benefits 
the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables 
certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 
the pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds 
for fiscal  we used a pre retirement discount rate for our domestic plans of and varying rates on our international plans of between and 
the pre retirement rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long term bonds with an aa rating  or equivalent  from a major rating agency 
we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans 
for fiscal  we used an expected return on plan assets of for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between and for our international plans 
in determining the long term rate of return for a plan  we consider the historical rates of return  the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies 
the us qualified plan asset allocation as of june  was approximately equity investments  fixed income investments and other investments 
the asset allocation of our combined international plans as of june  was approximately equity investments  fixed income investments and other investments 
the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods 
for fiscal  our pension plans had actual returns on assets of million as compared with expected returns on assets of million  which resulted in a net deferred gain of million 
a basis point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal pension expense in millions basis point increase basis point decrease discount rate expected return on assets our post retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates  which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal would have had the following effects in millions one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest costs effect on post retirement benefit obligations for fiscal  we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the domestic plans of and varying rates for our international plans of between and 
we anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between and 
the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal will cause approximately a million decrease in pension expense in fiscal we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
on an annual basis  or sooner if certain events or circumstances warrant  we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose 
to mitigate undue influence  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we have current net deferred tax assets of million and non current net deferred tax liabilities of million 
the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization  as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates 
included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately million for deferred tax assets  which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date  where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 
based on our assessments  no additional valuation allowance is required 
if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 
we provide tax reserves for federal  state  local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit 
the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective critical estimate 
although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain  in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures 
in certain circumstances  the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  including those that cannot be quantified  they could have a material impact on our results of operations  as we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal see results of operations  fiscal as compared with fiscal provision for income taxes 
derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 
we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates  as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
hedge effectiveness is documented  assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments 
variables that are external to us such as social  political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 
for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments  refer to liquidity and capital resources market risk 
stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuation 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of based upon the implied volatility at the time of issuance 
with regard to the weighted average option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined based on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting  realizable value  long run exercise propensity  pent up demand  stock run up effect and short time to maturity effect 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june   we used a weighted average expected option life assumption of approximately years 
while we believe the above critical estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur  if we were to increase or decrease the expected option life by year and simultaneously increase or decrease the expected volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately million in either direction for the fiscal year ended june  quantitative analysis during the three year period ended june   there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies  nor to the related significant estimates 
with the exception of our tax settlement with the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were previously inestimable see results of operations  fiscal as compared with fiscal provision for income taxes  the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 
while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects  other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales  cost of sales  operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes 
for fiscal  had these estimates been changed simultaneously by in either direction  our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately million  operating expenses would have changed by approximately million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
the collective impact of these changes on operating income  net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately million  million and  respectively 
results of operations overview we manufacture  market and sell skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over countries and territories 
we believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner 
with this goal in mind  we have developed a long term strategy based on the following five imperatives optimize brand portfolio strengthen product categories strengthen and expand geographic presence diversify and strengthen distribution channels achieve operational and cost excellence in fiscal  our achievements included excellent growth in sales and profits in our makeup artist brands  the divestiture of stila  the strengthening of est e lauder pleasures  and the introduction of new products such as missoni fragrances and unforgivable 
these makeup and fragrance efforts  together with successful niche skin care and hair care products have further strengthened our product categories 
around the globe  we generated growth in sales and profits in our travel retail business and increased our presence in china and india 
in alternative channels  we continued to grow our online business  achieved double digit profitability in our m a c stores and improved our performance at our aveda stores 
short term improvements in operational and organizational effectiveness led to improved customer service levels and better alignment of financial and inventory objectives and strategic cost cutting 
we also managed to cut costs through our voluntary separation program and the related reorganization of certain operations 
at the same time  we continued to make progress on our strategic modernization initiative  pursuant to which we are planning to standardize business processes across our brands  operating units and sales affiliates and implement enterprise wide sap information systems that will provide us with integrated data  processes and technologies 
during fiscal  we also faced challenges  many of which we expect to be ongoing in fiscal for instance  we continue to see challenges for certain of our core brands due in part to the consolidation and changes taking place among retailers and the decline in effectiveness of gift with purchase promotions 
in addition  the fragrance business model continues to be a challenge  with even the most successful launches having difficulty becoming profitable 
efforts to expand geographically are complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers 
despite our efforts to diversify our distribution  there was no significant change in the mix of sales in the various channels 
continued increases in energy and raw material costs  as well as inventory obsolescence  are continuing to pressure cost of goods 
as we continue to implement our strategic imperatives  we expect to make selective investments  embark on new business endeavors  and pursue initiatives that we believe will have long term benefits 
the timing  impact and magnitude of any particular actions  such as an acquisition to strengthen our product categories and or diversify our distribution channels  are subject to numerous factors and cannot be predicted 
nevertheless  we expect that any such actions will impact our financial condition and or results of operations in one or more future quarterly and annual periods 
the following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal  and and reflects the basis of presentation described in note and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

the economics of developing  producing  launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each period 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased or million to  million due to growth in our makeup  skin care and hair care product categories  which was partially offset by lower sales in our fragrance product category 
the net increase reflects sales growth in all geographic regions 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to  million primarily due to new product launches 
the recent launches of resilience lift extreme ultra firming cremes and re nutriv ultimate lifting serum by est e lauder  and turnaround concentrate visible skin renewer and turnaround minute facial by clinique generated incremental sales of approximately million  combined 
perfectionist 
cp 
by est e lauder and products in clinique s step skin care system  bolstered by the introduction of liquid facial soap  contributed approximately million to the increase 
these improvements were offset by approximately million of decreases in sales of existing products in certain of our core brands as well as declines in our beautybank brands  which completed their initial rollout during the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  skin care net sales increased 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to  million reflecting growth from our makeup artist brands of approximately million 
this growth was partially offset by approximately million of lower sales from certain existing products  reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands  and declines in our beautybank brands  which completed their initial rollout during the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  makeup net sales increased 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products decreased or million to  million as we continue to be challenged in this product category  particularly in the americas region 
est e lauder beyond paradise and various fragrances from clinique and tommy hilfiger generated approximately million of lower sales 
also contributing to the decrease were lower sales of approximately million of true star by tommy hilfiger and lauder beyond paradise men by est e lauder as we anniversary the initial shipments of those products in the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by the recent launches of true star men by tommy hilfiger and unforgivable by sean john  which collectively contributed approximately million to the category  and higher sales of approximately million of dkny be delicious and est e lauder pleasures 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  fragrance net sales decreased 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million  primarily due to sales growth from bumble and bumble and aveda products 
bumble and bumble sales benefited from sales growth due to new points of distribution  increases in sales of core products and the launches of shine and powder products 
aveda net sales increases benefited from the recent launch of damage remedy hair care products  strong demand for color products and from the recent acquisition of a distributor 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  hair care net sales increased 
geographic regions net sales in the americas increased or million to  million 
the increase was led by growth in the united states of approximately million from our makeup artist and hair care brands  our internet distribution  and the introduction of the unforgivable fragrance by sean john 
partially offsetting this growth was approximately million related to weaknesses in certain of our core brands as a result of challenges from competitive pressures and business disruptions at certain key retailers  and lower sales from our beautybank brands  which completed their initial rollout during the prior year 
we expect business disruptions at certain key retailers in the united states to continue into fiscal net sales growth in canada  latin america and mexico contributed an additional million to the increase 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to  million  reflecting higher net sales of approximately million from our travel retail and distributor businesses  russia and the united kingdom  with all benefiting from the success of the dkny be delicious franchise and the sale of m a c products 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately million in spain and italy 
spain s net sales were adversely affected by changes to our distribution policy and a difficult retail environment 
net sales in italy were negatively impacted by changes to our distribution policy and  to a lesser extent  the balancing of inventory levels at its retailers 
on a local currency basis  net sales in europe  the middle east africa increased 
recent events related to the suspected terrorist activities in the united kingdom  and subsequent restrictions on products that can be carried in flight  have created uncertainty in the outlook for our travel retail business in fiscal based on current information  we do not believe these events will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for our fiscal first quarter or full year 
in fiscal  our travel retail business comprised approximately of total net sales  and accounted for approximately of operating income 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million 
strategic growth in china combined with positive results in korea and hong kong  contributed approximately million to sales growth in this region 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in japan and australia of approximately million 
japan s results were negatively impacted due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
the decrease in australia reflected slower sell through in a difficult retail environment  particularly in the fragrance category  as well as the balancing of inventory levels at a major retailer 
on a local currency basis  net sales in asia pacific increased 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to as compared with in the prior year 
this change reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately basis points  the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories of approximately basis points  a charge related to unutilized tooling of approximately basis points and basis points related to commodity material prices 
partially offsetting these increases were favorable changes in promotional activities of approximately basis points 
the higher price of oil has resulted in price increases in certain oil based chemicals  which has had a slight adverse effect on our cost of sales margin 
in an ongoing effort to mitigate the impact of these increases  we are seeking potential offsetting opportunities in other categories of material purchases through our sourcing initiative in lower cost manufacturing locations worldwide 
since certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 
in addition  future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the current year operating expense margin was negatively impacted by charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative of approximately million or approximately basis points  costs related to stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r of approximately basis points  and the estimated impact of both the merger of federated department stores  inc and the may department stores company and the hurricanes that affected the southern united states of approximately basis points 
partially offsetting these incremental costs were operating expense margin improvements of approximately basis points primarily resulting from net sales growth in brands and channels with lower advertising  merchandising and sampling cost structures as well as an overall reduction in this type of spending 
overall operating expenses reflected savings achieved during fiscal from our cost savings initiative 
changes in advertising  sampling and merchandising spending result from the type  timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
during fiscal  we recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support our long term financial objectives 
as part of this multi faceted initiative  we identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes 
the principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to north america based employees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees 
under this initiative  we incurred expenses related to one time termination benefits for employees  of which were involuntary  which benefits were based principally upon years of service 
in addition  we identified other cost savings opportunities to impr ove efficiencies in our distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs 
these charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing  contract cancellations  counter and door closings and product returns 
an additional million to million is expected to be incurred in fiscal related to the cost savings initiative 
for the year ended june   aggregate expenses of million were recorded as special charges related to the cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 
at june   million and million related to the cost savings initiative were recorded in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the costs and expected savings associated with our cost savings initiative  which impacted  and will continue to impact  our operating expenses and cost of sales fiscal expense fiscal payments accrued at june  fiscal savings estimated future annual savings in millions employee separation expenses facility closures and product distribution rationalization advertising and promotional effectiveness operating results operating income decreased  or million  to million 
operating margin was of net sales in fiscal as compared with in the prior year 
these results were negatively impacted by the effects of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of million  or of net sales 
in addition to the special charges  net sales growth was more than offset by the increases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously discussed 
the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of special charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative 
we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
product categories operating income declined or million to million in the fragrance product category reflecting lower sales and  to a lesser extent  expenses incurred related to development of new products and brands  partially offset by a shift in spending in certain of our core brands to other product categories 
as we continue to support selected fragrances and develop new products  we anticipate the fragrance category to remain challenging during fiscal skin care operating income decreased or million to million primarily reflecting lower than anticipated net sales in certain of our core brands 
operating income increased or million to million in the makeup product category primarily reflecting sales growth from our makeup artist brands  partially offset by declines in certain of our core brands 
hair care operating income increased or million to million reflecting worldwide sales growth 
in fiscal  the merger of federated department stores  inc and the may department stores company had a negative impact on the operating results of our skin care  makeup and fragrance product categories  while incremental operating expenses associated with new accounting rules for stock based compensation negatively impacted all of our product categories 
geographic regions operating income in the americas decreased or million to million  primarily reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands  due in part to competitive pressures and retailer consolidations  and incremental operating expenses of approximately million associated with new accounting rules for stock based compensation 
the ongoing success of our makeup artist and hair care brands and our internet distribution partially offset these challenges 
we expect business disruptions to continue into fiscal at certain key retailers in the united states 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income decreased or million to million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower results in spain  benelux belgium  the netherlands and luxembourg and italy of approximately million  collectively 
these decreases were partially offset by improvements of approximately million in france  our travel retail business and central europe hungary  poland and czech republic 
in asia pacific  operating income increased or million to million 
this increase reflects improved results of approximately million in korea  japan and china  partially offset by lower results in taiwan and thailand of approximately million  collectively 
as china is an emerging market for us  we have invested  and plan to continue to invest  in new brand expansion and business opportunities there 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in the prior year 
the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates and  to a lesser extent  higher average debt balances due to outstanding commercial paper during the year 
the increased expense was partially offset by increased interest income related to higher investment interest rates 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was as compared with in the prior year 
the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the company s effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring and recurring factors including  but not limited to  the geographic mix of earnings  the timing and amount of foreign dividends  enacted tax legislation  state and local taxes  tax audit findings and settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies 
on july   we announced a settlement with the internal revenue service irs regarding its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended june  through june  the settlement resolves previously disclosed issues raised during the irs s examination  including transfer pricing and foreign tax credit computations 
the settlement of these issues resulted in a tax charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and represents the aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of the ajca 
in connection with the repatriation  we finalized computations of the related aggregate tax impact  resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately million 
the tax settlement  coupled with the ajca favorable tax adjustment  resulted in a net increase to our fiscal income tax provision of approximately million 
the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the tax settlement charge of approximately basis points  an increase of approximately basis points resulting from our foreign operations and an increase in nondeductible expenses of approximately basis points 
these increases were partially offset by the net reduction in the incremental tax charge relative to the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the ajca of approximately basis points  as well as a reduction of approximately basis points for miscellaneous items 
discontinued operations on april  the effective date  we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting unit that marketed and sold stila brand products to stila corp 
the purchaser  an affiliate of sun capital partners  inc  for consideration of million 
the sale price included cash of million  a promissory note with a notional value of million and a fair value of million and convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of million and a fair value of million 
as additional consideration for the purchased assets  and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale agreement  the purchaser will pay us an amount equal to two percent of the annual net sales of the acquired business during the period commencing on the effective date and ending august  we will use these proceeds to satisfy our commitment under the agreement pursuant to which we originally purchased the stila business 
the purchaser immediately assumed responsibility for all decisions regarding the operations of the stila business and we agreed to divest ourself of continuing involvement in the stila business  except as described below 
in fiscal  we recorded charges of million net of million tax benefit to discontinued operations  which reflected the loss on the disposition of the business of million  net of tax  and adjustments to the fair value of assets sold  the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the purchaser and other costs in connection with the sale 
the charges also include the operating losses of million  net of tax  for the fiscal year ended june  net sales associated with the discontinued operations were million for the fiscal year ended june  all statements of earnings information for the prior years has been restated for comparative purposes  including the restatement of the makeup product category and each of the geographic regions presented in note segment data and related information 
in order to facilitate the transition of the stila business to the purchaser  we agreed to provide certain information systems  accounting and other back office services to the purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the estimated costs of providing these transition services 
we also agreed with the purchaser to provide certain distribution and online services 
in both cases  the services are expected to conclude in fiscal in addition  we agreed to manufacture and sell to the purchaser a limited range of products for a period of up to four months following the effective date and  in the case of one product  of up to two years 
net earnings net earnings as compared with the prior fiscal year declined million or to million and diluted net earnings per common share decreased from to 
net earnings from continuing operations as compared with the prior fiscal year decreased by million or to million and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased from to 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased or million to  million reflecting growth in all major product categories  led by makeup and skin care  and growth in all geographic regions  led by europe  the middle east africa

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was and remained unchanged compared with fiscal favorable net changes in production and supply chain efforts of approximately basis points  primarily driven by favorable material sourcing  were offset by the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories  as discussed above  which includes the impact of the beautybank brands 
changes in exchange rates compared with the prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin 
since certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 
in addition  future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to from in fiscal our planned increase in advertising  merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately basis points was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs 
we also realized a benefit of approximately basis points from the elimination of royalty payments previously made to mrs 
est e lauder 
changes in advertising  sampling and merchandising spending result from the type  timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
operating results based on the growth of net sales  our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously discussed  operating income increased or million to million as compared with the prior fiscal year 
operating margins were of net sales in fiscal as compared with in fiscal product categories operating income increased or million in makeup and or million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products 
operating results also increased or million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products 
while we experienced improved results in fiscal due to these new launches  the fragrance business continues to be challenging 
hair care operating results decreased or million reflecting an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the united states as well as the opening of new points of distribution in korea and japan  partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed 
hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a third party supplier 
the situation was rectified during fiscal geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million  primarily due to higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail environment  strong product launches and growth from our newer brands 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business  spain  the united kingdom and switzerland of approximately million  collectively 
partially offsetting this improvement were lower results in france  which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of major retailers  and in russia  where we converted our business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary  of approximately million on a combined basis 
in asia pacific  operating income increased or million to million 
this increase reflected improved results in hong kong  taiwan  thailand and japan of approximately million  collectively  partially offset by a decrease in operating income in korea and china of approximately million  combined 
in addition  the asia pacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new whitening products  which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in fiscal the decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of the preferred stock on june  and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining million of the preferred stock 
this improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was as compared with in fiscal the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions  the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain nondeductible expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately million of foreign earnings in fiscal  which included million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the ajca 
this action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately million in fiscal  which included an incremental tax charge of approximately million 
the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately basis points and an increase of approximately basis points resulting from our foreign operations 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of approximately basis points  a decrease in state and local income taxes of approximately basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately basis points 
net earnings net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately and  respectively 
net earnings as compared with fiscal improved million to million and diluted net earnings per common share improved to from 
net earnings from continuing operations increased by million or and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased to from in the prior fiscal year 
the planned repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the ajca  as discussed above  resulted in an incremental tax charge of approximately million  or 
per diluted common share 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper  borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at june  at june   our outstanding borrowings of million included i million of senior notes due january consisting of million principal  unamortized debt discount of million and a million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap  ii million of senior notes due october consisting of million principal and unamortized debt discount of million  iii a million euro note approximately million at the exchange rate at june  payable semi annually through february at a variable interest rate  iv million of capital lease obligations  v a billion yen short term borrowing under a revolving credit facility approximately million at the exchange rate at june   vi million of outstanding loan participation notes due july at an initial interest rate of  and vii million of other short term borrowings 
we have a million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states 
our commercial paper is currently rated a by standard poor s and p by moody s 
our long term credit ratings are a with a stable outlook by standard poor s and a with a stable outlook by moody s 
at june   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional million in debt securities and million in additional uncommitted credit facilities  of which million was used as of june  we have an unused million senior revolving credit facility that expires on may  the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including financing working capital  and also as credit support for our commercial paper program 
up to the equivalent of million of the facility is available for multi currency loans 
the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime  which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent  or the federal funds rate plus 
the credit facility has an annual fee of million  payable quarterly  based on our current credit ratings 
as of june   we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness and liens 
in may  we entered into a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution for the primary purpose of funding cash dividend repatriations from certain of our international affiliates to the united states as permitted by the ajca 
under the agreement  we may borrow up to million in the form of loan participation notes which were issued by one of our subsidiaries in europe 
the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement will be an all in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing 
at june   million was outstanding under this agreement and the notes are being refinanced on a periodic basis as they mature at the then prevailing market interest rates 
debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 
in march  we entered into a billion yen revolving credit facility that expires on march  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on tibor tokyo interbank offered rate and a basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance 
we borrowed billion yen under the new facility on march  to repay the previously outstanding billion yen term loan that was to mature on that date 
the outstanding balance at june  million at the exchange rate at june  is classified as short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
in october  we redeemed the remaining million of the preferred stock that was outstanding at june  and paid the accrued dividends thereon 
our business is seasonal in nature and  accordingly  our working capital needs vary 
from time to time  we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding 
to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations  we could  subject to market conditions  issue commercial paper or loan participation notes  issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility or other credit facilities 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was at june  and at june  the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years 
generally  we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases  which have been moderate 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal the net increase in operating cash flows for fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily reflected favorable changes in certain working capital accounts  partially offset by a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations 
net accounts receivable balances decreased primarily reflecting higher collections domestically during fiscal inventory levels remained constant at june  as compared to june  due to our efforts to better manage our inventory 
increases in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected higher advertising  merchandising and sampling accruals compared to the prior year  as well as significant deferred compensation and supplemental pension payments made to retired executives in fiscal additional increases in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities reflected accrued employee separation benefits related to the company s cost savings initiative 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the net decrease reflected changes in certain working capital accounts  partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes and an increase in net earnings from continuing operations 
the change in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected the payment of significant deferred compensation and supplemental payments made to retired executives in fiscal accounts receivable increased as a result of sales growth in fiscal  reflecting growth in international markets and customers which generally carry longer payment terms 
the timing of payments from certain domestic customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the period also contributed to increased accounts receivable 
the increase in inventory was primarily due to actual and anticipated sales levels  the building of safety stock in our new distribution center in europe  and  to a lesser extent  the inclusion of new points of distribution 
the shift in cash activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of disbursements year over year as well as the initiation of a vendor managed inventory program 
net deferred taxes decreased primarily due to the then anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal as a result of the ajca and the realization of the tax benefits related to payments made to retired executives 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal primarily reflected the cash payment related to the jo malone limited earn out provision and  to a lesser extent  aveda distributor acquisitions 
capital expenditures also increased in fiscal primarily reflecting our continuing company wide initiative to upgrade our information systems  which was initiated in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures reflected those costs related to our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  new store openings  store improvements  counter construction and information technology enhancements 
in fiscal  we expect to purchase the remaining equity interest in bumble and bumble products  llc and bumble and bumble  llc 
cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition to common stock repurchases and dividend payments  cash flows used for financing activities reflected the repayment of short term commercial paper that was outstanding at june  and the october redemption of the remaining preferred stock 
these outflows were partially offset by short term borrowings under our loan participation note program 
the billion yen term loan outstanding at the end of fiscal was refinanced by borrowings under the new billion yen revolving credit facility that we entered into in march the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal primarily reflected common stock repurchases and dividend payments  partially offset by the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the receipt of proceeds from employee stock option transactions 
the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal primarily related to the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of the preferred stock  common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and from employee stock option transactions 
dividends on november   the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 
per share  or million  on our class a and class b common stock  which was paid on december  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal was 
per share  or million  which was paid on december  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  dividends on the preferred stock were million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
these dividends have been characterized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the respective fiscal years 
pension plan funding and expense we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations 
several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings 
in the united states  we maintain a trust based  noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan us qualified plan 
additionally  we have an unfunded  nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations 
our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
several factors influence our annual funding requirements 
for the us qualified plan  our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages 
such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and subsequent pension legislation  and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes 
for each international plan  our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations 
in addition  amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in critical accounting polices and estimates 
the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates  the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions  investment performance and funding decisions 
for fiscal and  there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa 
however  while we did not make any cash contributions pursuant to the plan during fiscal  we made cash contributions of million during fiscal at management s discretion 
during fiscal  we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the us qualified plan 
for fiscal and  we made benefit payments under our non qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of million and million  respectively 
we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal of million 
for fiscal and  we made cash contributions to our international pension plans of million and million  respectively 
we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal of million 
in addition  at june  and  we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and  accordingly  a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity for the change in such liability 
during fiscal  we recorded a benefit  net of deferred tax  of million while in fiscal  we recorded a charge  net of deferred tax  of million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
commitments and contingencies certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions 
these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business 
the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment will be made in fiscal  when we expect to purchase the remaining equity interest in bumble and bumble products  llc and bumble and bumble  llc 
since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business  we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
for additional contingencies  refer to item legal proceedings 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june  payments due in fiscal total thereafter in millions debt service operating lease commitments unconditional purchase obligations cost savings initiative obligations total contractual obligations includes long term and short term debt and the related projected interest costs  and to a lesser extent  capital lease commitments

unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments  estimated future earn out payments  estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements  advertising commitments  capital improvement commitments  planned funding of pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements 
future earn out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june   without consideration for potential renewal periods 
refer to results of operations  fiscal as compared with fiscal operating expenses 
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates 
we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment  we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  the nature of the risk being hedged  how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively  and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value  cash flow  or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective  then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 
foreign exchange risk management we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions  as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges 
hedge effectiveness of forward exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot forward difference which is recorded in current period earnings 
hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology 
the ineffective portion of both forward exchange and foreign currency option contracts is recorded in current period earnings 
for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective  hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs 
if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur  then any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to current period earnings 
as of june   these cash flow hedges were highly effective  in all material respects 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results 
the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro million  swiss franc million  british pound million  canadian dollar million  japanese yen million  australian dollar million and south korean won million 
the foreign currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the japanese yen million  euro million  canadian dollar million  swiss franc million and south korean won million 
interest rate risk management we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures 
all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing million senior notes to variable interest rates based on six month libor 
we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
as of june   the fair value hedge was highly effective  in all material respects 
market risk we use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level 
we estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the measured value at risk  calculated as an average  for the twelve months ended june  related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was million and million  respectively 
the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results  which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
we believe  however  that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions 
the first step is recognition and the second is measurement 
for recognition  an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date of fin may be recognized or  continue to be recognized  upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
fin will apply to fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact fin will have on our consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective for us in fiscal and are unable  at this time  to quantify the impact  if any  to retained earnings at the time of adoption
