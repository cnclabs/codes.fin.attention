item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance modules  components and foundry services for communications applications 
our focus is on the specialized expertise  materials and know how of rf and other high and intermediate frequency applications 
we enjoy diversity in our markets  applications  products  technology and customer base 
our products are designed on various wafer substrates including compound semiconductor materials such as gaas and piezoelectric crystals such as litao we use a variety of process technologies using gaas substrates including hbt and phemt 
using various other substrates we also manufacture saw and baw products 
using these materials and our proprietary technology  we believe our products can overcome the performance barriers of competing devices in a variety of applications and offer other key advantages such as steeper selectivity  lower distortion  higher power and power added efficiency  reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control 
for example  gaas has inherent physical properties that allow its electrons to move up to five times faster than those of silicon 
this higher electron mobility permits the manufacture of gaas integrated circuits that operate at higher levels of performance than silicon devices 
our customers include major communication companies worldwide 
strategy and industry considerations our business strategy is to provide our customers with high performance  low cost solutions to applications in the wireless handset  base station  broadband  and military markets 
our mission is  connecting the digital world to the global network  and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within the communications and military industries 
in wireless handset market  we provide high performance devices such as rf filters  duplexers  receivers  small signal components  power amplifiers  switches and passive components 
we have also developed integrated rf modules with the goal of maximizing content and minimizing stacked margins  by offering complete module solutions with almost all subcomponents sourced from our own technologies and manufacturing facilities 
in broadband communications and wireless base station markets  we are a supplier of both active gaas and passive saw components 
we also provide the military market with phased array radar antenna components and in were chosen to be the prime contractor on a darpa contract to develop high power wide band amplifiers in gallium nitride gan  a next generation gaas derived technology 
the semiconductor industry in general has been subject to slumping demand and excess capacity since  however demand began to grow in this was the case for our business as well although we have not seen a return to our peak demand levels 
wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities represent a very high level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of low demand  selling prices also tend to decrease which  when combined with high fixed manufacturing costs  can create a material adverse impact on operating results 
in we were able to increase the utilization at our facilities  however  we continued to experience significant pressure on our selling prices  which had a negative impact on our financial results 
specifically  the wireless handset market continued to gain general strength in  continuing a trend that began in the second half of the year was particularly strong which we believe gives us a positive start to the total global unit shipments for the entire market grew by more than  resulting in projected shipments of over million handsets in  up from approximately million units in we believe we are positioned well for sustained demand in the wireless phone market for due to continued strength in china  india and other emerging countries along with high phone replacement rates due to new features such as digital cameras  video recorders  music players  gps  bluetooth  internet access  
table of contents mobile television and other video standards 
however  in  we experienced significant selling price pressure on some of our highest volume products 
in addition  we were negatively affected by the continued acceptance of direct conversion architecture which reduces the number of saw if filter products needed in the receiver portion of wireless phones 
as the handset market expands  we expect this to also create increased demand in the base station market  particularly in demand for point to point radios for base station backhaul 
base stations are critical to the success of any mobile network and the increased demands on networks from new technology rollouts has increased demand in this market 
in addition  the continued deployment of base stations in asia and other emerging markets such as india are major drivers of demand 
in  our revenue from this market increased from although we saw cost cutting efforts in this market  we believe we will be able to maintain favorable margins by reducing our manufacturing costs and increasing the functionality of our products 
additionally  as the wireless infrastructure networks build out in developing countries and remote areas  we expect that we will benefit from point to point radio product demand for back haul 
the revenue we generated from our broadband products  which includes wlan  satellite  cable and other standard products  declined approximately in as compared to however  revenues from this market were up approximately in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of and approximately from the third quarter of this current strength has been primarily driven by our dual lna product and increased penetration in the cordless phone segment 
revenues from military market products decreased approximately in from and accounted for approximately of our revenues in  as compared to approximately in and in we are actively engaged with multiple military industry contractors in the development of next generation phased array systems 
we have key design wins in major projects such as the joint strike fighter and f  and expect to participate in other large projects such as the b radar upgrade 
in addition  in we entered into a multi year contract from the darpa to develop high power wide band amplifiers in gallium nitride 
we hope to expand these programs and beyond 
we do not expect our revenues to increase materially as a result of any near term conflicts with foreign nations 
the current conflict in the middle east is consuming a significant portion of the military budget that may have otherwise been available for advanced aircraft upgrades and deployments and there is some risk that programs such as the f raptor and jsf could be delayed 
our products are used in long lead time  large scale programs 
once a component has been designed into an end use product for a military application  the same component is generally used during the entire production life of the end use product 
as a result  we tend to produce large volumes of these components 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  the valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating expense when we impair assets or accelerate depreciation  valuation of investments in privately held 
table of contents companies  which impacts net income when we record impairments  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  and stock based compensation which impacts inventory  cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances  and reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
recognition of revenue we derive revenues primarily from the sale of standard and customer specific products and services in the wireless handset  broadband  base station and military markets 
we also receive revenues from foundry services  non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively have been less than of consolidated revenues for any period 
our markets during these comparable periods include wireless handsets  base stations  military and broadband which includes wlan  satellite  optical networking  automotive and other standard products 
our distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and one distributor 
sales of our products are generally made through either our sales force and independent manufacturers representatives or through our distributor 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers  with shipments to our buy sell representatives and our distribution network accounting for less than of total revenues during and revenues from the sale of standard and customer specific products are recognized when title to the products pass to the buyer 
revenues from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees are recorded when the service is completed or upon certain milestones as provided for in the agreements 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized in a manner so that the fees will reasonably reflect assured realization as the production is completed 
revenues from our distributor are recognized when the product is sold to the distributor 
our distributor agreement provides for selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although we occasionally offer price protections  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve 
further  the distributor is obligated to pay the amount and the price or payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product  the distributor takes title to the product and bears substantially all of the risks of ownership  the distributor has economic substance  we have no significant obligations for future performance to bring about resale  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we allow our distributor to return products for warranty reasons  and stock rotation rights  within certain limitations  and reserve for such instances 
customers can only return products for warranty reasons 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a combination of standard cost and moving average cost methodologies to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at a lower of cost or market valuation  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation  based on historical experience and our judgment of economic conditions  includes identifying those parts specifically identified as obsolete and reserving for them  analyzing forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and reserving for the excess  and identifying and recording other specific reserves 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  additional inventory reserves may be required and would have a negative impact on our gross margin in the period the adjustment is made 

table of contents long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment of their carrying value when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets  plant closure or production line discontinuance  technological obsolescence  or other changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined based on market prices or discounted cash flow analysis  depending on the nature of the asset 
any estimate of future cash flows is inherently uncertain 
the factors we take into consideration in making estimates of future cash flows include product life cycles  pricing trends  future capital needs  cost trends  product development costs  competitive factors and technology trends as they each affect cash inflows and outflows 
technology markets are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid shifts in demand that are difficult to predict in terms of direction and severity 
if an asset is written down to fair value  that value becomes the asset s new carrying value and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
investments in privately held companies in previous years  we made a number of investments in small  privately held technology companies in which we held less than of the capital stock or hold notes receivable 
however  at december   we had impaired the value of these investments to a zero book value based upon an evaluation of each of the company s financial condition 
in addition  as a result of the sale of our former optoelectronics operations  we received as partial consideration million of preferred stock in cyoptics  inc cyoptics and an unsecured promissory note from cyoptics for million  that was discounted million to reflect the current market rate for similar debt of comparable companies 
we account for all of these investments at cost unless their value has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we review these investments periodically for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
during our review  we evaluate the financial condition of the issuer  market conditions  and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the issuer that differ from expectation  could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
during  we reduced the value of three investments by a total of million  net 
additionally during  we sold million of assets received from the liquidation of an investment we held in another privately held company including million of intellectual property received from the liquidation 
the intellectual property was held at a zero book value and we recorded a gain for the entire amount of proceeds received 
the remaining assets received from the liquidation the investment resulted in a gain of less than million 
during and  we reduced the value of multiple investments by million and million  respectively 
as of december   our total investment in privately held companies was million  compared to million as of december  income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
a significant amount of management judgment is involved in preparing our annual provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we evaluate liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and international tax jurisdictions 
significant income tax exposures include potential challenges on foreign entities  merger  acquisition and disposition transactions and intercompany pricing 
exposures are settled primarily through the completion 
table of contents of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by other factors 
changes could cause management to find a revision of past estimates appropriate 
the liabilities are frequently reviewed by management for their adequacy and appropriateness 
as of december   we were not currently under audit by the us income taxing authorities 
we concluded federal income tax audits for the us consolidated tax group on earlier years  most recently for the years and a german tax audit of our subsidiary  triquint semiconductor gmbh  was completed during the third quarter of no significant adjustments were required as a result of the resolution of the audit 
tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the taxing authorities 
potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure  primarily through the completion of audits by the taxing jurisdictions and or the expiration of the statutes of limitation 
to the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized during the period of the event 
management believes that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis 
adjustments are made as needed and these adjustments have an impact on our financial statements in the periods in which they are recorded 
in  our optoelectronics operations were classified as discontinued operations 
during the year  we recorded income from the operations during the period in which we operated it  as well as a gain from the sale of the operations in the second quarter and the sale of the building in the third quarter 
we had net operating losses from prior periods which we applied to these gains to offset the tax impact from these gains 
however  sfas no 
requires the income tax effects related to these transactions be allocated among continuing and discontinued operations and as a result we recorded tax expense on our discontinued operations of million which was offset by a tax benefit recorded on our continuing operations for the same amount 
stock based compensation during the periods presented we accounted for compensation cost related to employee stock options and other forms of employee stock based compensation plans other than esop in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the current market prices of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
we applied financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allows entities to continue to apply the provision of apb no 
and provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
we are required to account for stock based compensation under sfas no 
r  share based payment  in our financial statements in the first quarter of the accounting for stock based compensation involves a number of estimates about the expected lives of stock options  interest rates  stock volatility  and assumptions as well as the selection of a valuation model 
we have elected to use the black scholes option valuation model to value our stock based compensation 
a change in any of the estimates used in the model  or the selection of a different option pricing model  could have a material impact on our pro forma net income loss disclosures in the periods presented and on our financial statements in future periods 
for further discussion regarding the implementation of sfas no 
r  see recent accounting pronouncements below 
we are currently estimating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r to be between million to million unaudited in 
table of contents acquisitions and divestitures tfr technologies  inc on january   we successfully completed the acquisition of tfr  a manufacturer and developer of thin film resonator filters for communication applications using baw technology 
we believe that baw technology is critical to developing higher frequency filters for next generation wireless communication products and is a natural complement to our saw technology 
on the acquisition date  we paid million and paid an additional million in january additionally  we are obligated to pay royalties on revenues we recognize from sales of tfr technology based products over the four year period subsequent to the acquisition date  up to a maximum of million 
as of december   we had recognized million of employee retention charges as a result of the acquisition and had recognized less than million of revenue from products qualifying for royalties 
the tfr acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
details of the purchase price are as follows in millions cash paid at closing cash due within one year acquisition costs total the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon fair values as follows in millions cash accounts receivables and other assets inventory property  plant and equipment intangible assets goodwill payables and other liabilities total during the third and fourth quarters of  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we adjusted the purchase price allocation to correct the beginning balance of tfr s assets and liabilities on the date of purchase 
the adjustments are reflected as an adjustment to goodwill 
agere s optoelectronics business on january   we completed an acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
the transaction included the products  technology and some facilities related to agere s optoelectronics business  which includes active and passive optical components  optical amplifiers  optical transceivers and other optical products 
as part of the acquisition  we also assumed operation of the back end assembly and test operations associated with these products at a leased facility in matamoros  mexico 
we acquired this business to expand our market and product offerings in the optical networks market 
through a transition services agreement  agere provided some business infrastructure services to us for a short period following the close of the transaction to ensure seamless transition of the business operations 
on may   we sold a portion of the assets acquired in this transaction for million in cash 
further  during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring of our optoelectronics operation strategy and incurred charges of million related to the restructuring 

table of contents during the first quarter of  we concluded that the optoelectronics operations we purchased were not going to meet the revenue projections we made when we initially acquired the operations from agere 
significant reductions in average selling prices combined with reduced demand and valuation for new technologies in the optoelectronic market resulted in continued losses from these operations 
as a result  we announced the sale of these operations on april  and entered into an agreement to sell our optoelectronics operations in breinigsville  pennsylvania and our optoelectronics subsidiary in matamoros  mexico to cyoptics 
with the sale  we believe we will benefit from focusing our attention on our growing wireless handset  base station  military and broadband markets and build upon our successful portfolio of gaas semiconductor and filter products 
the transaction allowed us to exit our optoelectronics operations that manufacture inp optical components  however  we will continue to manufacture and sell gaas based semiconductor products for optoelectronics equipment market produced and originally developed at our oregon and texas facilities 
revenues from gaas products for optical systems accounted for less than our revenues in and  respectively 
the sale  completed on april   was an asset sale including the products  manufacturing equipment  inventory  the mexican entity  related intellectual property rights and other assets that constitute the operations that manufacture inp optical chips and components for the optical networking market 
cyoptics paid us the following consideration million cash at closing  million of cyoptics preferred stock and a promissory note in the amount of approximately million  which was recorded net of a million discount to record the note at current market rates 
cyoptics also assumed certain liabilities associated with the optoelectronics operations  such as warranty obligations to customers 
separately  on march   triquint optoelectronics  a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the land and building and related facilities occupied by our optoelectronics operations in breinigsville  pennsylvania 
on july   we completed the sale to hamilton tek partners  lp hamilton for million  less commissions  fees  and other costs to sell the facility 
pursuant to the agreement  we assigned to hamilton our lease to cyoptics for approximately  square feet of the  square foot facility 
the lease was executed on april  and was for a period of two years  with an option to renew 
in association with the sale  we have provided hamilton with a guarantee on cyoptics obligation under the original lease term 
at december   the lease guarantee was valued at million 
our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the breinigsville  pennsylvania and matamoros  mexico optoelectronics operations as discontinued operations 
assets and liabilities held for sale as noted above  we accounted for our optoelectronics operations in breinigsville  pennsylvania and matamoros  mexico as discontinued operations  in accordance with gaap 
as a result  we classified the assets and liabilities associated with these operations as held for sale 
as of december   we classified million of assets and million of liabilities as held for sale relating to these operations 
as of december   we had disposed of all of the assets and liabilities of the operations and had no assets or liabilities classified as held for sale 
additionally  during we determined that we would sell excess equipment associated with our semiconductor manufacturing operations in texas and oregon and assets obtained from the liquidation of an investment we had in a privately held company 
as of december   million of these assets remained as held for sale 
during the first quarter of  we transferred million of the excess equipment located at our texas facility back into production at its fair market value in accordance with gaap 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded an impairment charge of less than million 
also during the first quarter of  we sold million of the assets we obtained from the liquidation of an investment we had in a privately held company and disposed of approximately million of the assets 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded a gain of less than million 
as of december   none of these assets remained classified as held for sale 

table of contents results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of operations addresses continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
in addition  because our remaining revenues from gaas based products for the optical networking end markets account for less than of our consolidated revenues  we are now presenting our revenues based on the following end markets wireless handsets  broadband  base stations and military 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we reclassified certain expenses previously classified as selling  general and administrative expenses to conform to current period presentation 
the reclassification was done to better align certain costs with their functional classification 
none of these reclassifications had an effect on net income or loss  or on stockholders equity as previously reported 
the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

table of contents years ended december  and revenues from continuing operations our revenues from continuing operations decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to significantly lower revenue in the wireless handset market  as handset manufacturers continued to migrate towards direct conversion architecture and sales of our if filter products declined 
declines were also seen in our broadband and military markets 
however  our revenues in the fourth quarter of increased million to million  as compared to million in the fourth quarter of further  our fourth quarter revenue increased million as compared to the third quarter of which we believe is an indication of our strong traction in the wireless handset and broadband markets 
the demand for our products began to strengthen in the second quarter of and remained strong at year end 
our overall book to bill ratio for the quarter ended december  was to due primarily to strength in the broadband  military and other markets 
the ratio at december  was a substantial increase from the to ratio at december  in the third quarter of we began assigning our digital radio revenue  including point to point revenue  to the base station market to better reflect the end use of these products 
we have reclassified historical data to reflect this change 
incorporating this classification change for point to point radios  our revenues by end market for and were as follows years ended december  revenues wireless handsets broadband base stations military wireless handsets our revenues from products for the wireless handset market decreased approximately in  compared to the decline in revenue was primarily due to a decline in our shipments of products for cdma phones as a result of the impact of direct conversion architectures which reduces the demand for if filters  lnas and mixers 
shipments of if filters declined approximately in as compared to  largely due to the use of direct conversion architecture in cdma phones 
further  we experienced a decline in revenue of approximately from our duplexer and receiver products in as compared to other factors affecting the overall decline in handset revenue in as compared to included average selling price asp pressure on our duplexer products which experienced an asp decline of 
offsetting these declines were year over year increases in revenue from our power amplifiers  power amplifier modules and transmit modules  rf filters and front end modules and switches 
compared to the fourth quarter of  our wireless handset revenue in the fourth quarter of increased approximately 
further  as compared to the third quarter of  our wireless handset revenue increased which we believe is an indication of our strong traction in this market and positions us well for growth in overall  our wireless revenues from gsm products increased from in to in the increase was more prevalent in the fourth quarter of where our gsm products accounted for of our wireless handset revenue  compared to in the fourth quarter of our largest growth in this standard came from integrated filter and pam products 
specifically  our revenues from gsm integrated products  dominated by our quad filter bank module  grew from approximately million in to approximately million in while our gsm pa and pam revenue grew to approximately 
table of contents million in  compared to approximately million in at the same time  our revenue from cdma applications declined in to of our wireless handset revenue  from in this decline was anticipated due to the decline in revenue from if filters  mixers and lnas as a result of the direct conversion architecture 
we experienced growth from our cdma pa and pam products which increased to revenues of approximately million in as compared to revenues of million in broadband revenues from the broadband market and other products included in this segment  which include wlan  satellite  cable and other standard products  decreased in as compared to however  revenues in the fourth quarter of increased from the fourth quarter of and from the third quarter of the decline in revenue in as compared to was primarily due to a decline in our optical  wlan  satellite and other products 
these declines were partially offset by increases in revenue from our gps and ground station products 
base station revenues from the base station products  including point to point radios  increased approximately in as compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from digital radio products  partially offset by lower revenue from cdma products 
in  approximately of our base station revenue was derived from point to point radio products compared to approximately in our revenue from gsm gprs edge base station products declined approximately in  as compared to  and accounted for approximately of the base station revenue 
our cdma and wideband cdma base station product revenue declined approximately in as compared to and accounted for approximately of the base station revenue in the decline for cdma was due to cdma build out softness as evdo build outs in korea  japan and the us have predominantly been completed combined with a the delay of g licensing in china which postponed both cdma and wcdma build outs in that region 
military revenues from our military related products decreased approximately in as compared to the decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue from if filters  hpas high power amplifiers and other products 
these decreases were mostly offset by increases in revenue from research and development and rf filters 
the increase in research and development revenue was primarily due to the execution of a darpa contract in the first quarter of for the development of a gallium nitride process and products  in which we are the prime contractor 
domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were million in  compared to million in revenues from international customers were million in compared to million in our revenues from international customers continued to grow due to the increasing demand for wireless phones and infrastructure products from countries in asia  india and other developing countries where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us revenues from china was the only foreign region which represented or more of revenues in with approximately million 
in  china and korea were the only foreign regions which represented or more of revenues with approximately million and million  respectively 
revenues generated from our us operations were million in and million in  respectively 
revenues generated from our international operations were million in and million in  respectively 
transfers between these operations were million in and million in  respectively 
our us operations accounted for million of our long lived 
table of contents assets in and million in our international operations accounted for million of our long lived assets in and million in gross profit gross profit is defined as revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes direct material  labor and overhead expenses and certain production costs related to non recurring engineering revenues 
in general  we derive a higher gross profit margin on lower volume products for the base station and broadband market  such as point to point radios and satellite systems  whereas products for wireless handsets are higher volume  more price sensitive and generally lower margin products 
our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to in  compared to in the decrease was primarily due to lower overall sales in  resulting in less absorption of fixed overhead costs  combined with lower asps on products such as saw filters and duplexers and lower yields from some of our new products 
the effect was most evident in the in the fourth quarter of as we reported a gross profit margin of during the quarter  compared to in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of however  we are taking the corrective action required to improve our yields and expect improvements in research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses include the costs incurred in the design of new products  as well as ongoing product research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses in decreased million to million in  as compared to million in as a percentage of revenue our research  development and engineering increased to in as compared to in the decrease in overall spending was primarily a result of the timing of our design cycles 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include commissions  labor expenses for marketing and administrative personnel  and other corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily due increased marketing expenses and labor costs and increased costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of as a percentage of revenue our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in as compared to in reduction in workforce in  we recorded a charge of million associated with a reduction in force of approximately employees assigned to our operations in apopka  florida and san jose  costa rica 
the charge was a result of our ongoing efforts to align costs and capacity with the reduced levels of production and revenues at these facilities 
in  we recorded net severance costs of million related to reductions in our workforce of approximately employees assigned to our texas operations 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in  we recorded impairments to long lived assets of million 
the impairments recorded in include impairments of excess six inch wafer fabrication equipment million  and a charge associated with the closing of our tianjin  china facility million 
the six inch wafer fabrication equipment was in excess of our needs and had been classified as held for sale 
the tianjin  china facility was closed as our primary customer in the region no longer required a manufacturing presence in the region 
impairments in were less than million and were associated with the write down of certain fabrication equipment held for sale to its fair market value 

table of contents gain on disposal of equipment in  we recorded a million gain on the disposal of equipment  primarily related to the sale of equipment at our oregon facility 
gains recorded on the disposal of equipment in were less than million 
acquisition related charges in  we recorded a million of charges related to the tfr anticipated earn out payment and retention bonuses  payable in there were no similar charges in interest income expense  net net interest income increased million in to a net interest income of million  compared to a net interest expense of million in this change was attributable to higher interest rates earned on our short and long term investments as interest rates on these investments rose in as compared to for example  in the average commercial paper interest rate was compared to in we repurchased million of our subordinated debt in the second quarter of and million in the second quarter of  both of which reduced our interest expense in foreign currency gain loss in  we recorded a foreign currency gain of million 
the gain was primarily attributable to foreign currency receivables of million approximately million at the exchange rate in effect at the time of the transactions that were reclassified as short term monetary asset in the third quarter of as a result of the reclassification  we recorded a foreign currency gain of million on the remeasurement of the receivables as the euro strengthened relative to the us dollar 
in november  we received payment on the receivable 
foreign currency gains in were less than million 
impairment charge investment in other companies in  we reduced the value of three investments by a total of million  net

the results of the discontinued operations in reflected only four months of full operations as we completed the sale on april  years ended december  and revenues from continuing operations our revenues increased million to million in compared to million in this increase in revenues was primarily due to increased shipments of products for the base station  wireless handset and broadband markets  specifically for applications for base stations for wireless communications  wlan  point to point radios  and satellite  and increased revenue for products for wireless phones 
the increase in revenues more than offsets declines in military related products

military revenues from our military related market decreased by approximately in compared to  due to the timing and roll out of large scale military programs and the negative impact that the war in iraq had on military related spending for fighter jets and research and development 
domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were million in  compared to million in revenues from international customers were million in compared to million in revenues from international customers continued to grow due to the increasing demand for wireless phones and infrastructure products from countries in asia  south america  and eastern europe where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us and western europe 
revenue from china were approximately million in and million in  respectively

the principal risks to these sources of liquidity are capital expenditures or investment needs in excess of our expectations  in which case we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity offerings  debt financings or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms

recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flow 
currently  we use the black scholes model for option expense calculation and presents pro forma disclosure of the statements of operations effect in financial statement footnotes only under apb no 
however  under sfas no 
r  pro forma disclosure of the statements of operations effects of share based payments will no longer be an alternative and all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  will be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas r was effective for us for the period commencing january  in response to the new accounting guidance under sfas r and sab no 
 we have begun to reevaluate our assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee options granted 
in addition  we will begin to analyze the holding patterns of employees based upon rank to better access the expected term of the options 
these revised assumptions will be incorporated in the first quarter of also in anticipation of the 
table of contents effective date  we accelerated the vesting of options  excluding option grants to our board members and chief executive officer  with an option price equal or greater to per share 
the acceleration was done in two phases  with the first acceleration in the fourth quarter of for all options with an option price equal to or greater than per share 
the second acceleration was done in the fourth quarter of for all options with an option price equal to or greater than per share 
both of the accelerations were done as part of a comprehensive review of our entire benefits program and the decision to accelerate some of our options was made after review of the our current stock price  the competitive benefits and costs from the options  the benefit of the options to the employees and the potential effects of sfas no 
r 
the closing price of our stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market  on the date of the first option acceleration was per share and per share on the date of the second option acceleration 
currently  we are forecasting the effect of sfas r and sab no 
see below to be approximately million unaudited in the first quarter of and between million and million unaudited for the full year 
in march  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 to provide guidance on sfas no 
r 
sab no 
provides the staff s view regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  this sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with non employees  the transition from non public to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas no 
r  the modification of employee share options prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r and disclosure in management s discussion and analysis subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
r 
sab no 
was effective march  currently  we are forecasting the effect of sfas r and sab no 
to be approximately million unaudited in the first quarter of and between million and million unaudited for the full year 
however the forecasted effect require significant estimates as the full effect is dependant upon future grant activity  future forfeiture and exercise rates  our stock price at grant date  our future stock price volatility  and other variables 
these factors could change substantially and have a material effect on our estimates 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 in an effort to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
fas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
fas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we believe our current accounting policy complies with the requirements of the new standard and as such the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb ratified a consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf with respect to eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations 
a number of issues have arisen in practice in applying the criteria in paragraph  and the following broad categories of issues related to the application of both criteria in that paragraph have been identified a whether the intent of the paragraph is that all operations and cash flows of the disposal component be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity or whether some minor level of operations or cash flow may remain  b if some insignificant level of operations or cash flows of the disposal component can continue without precluding discontinued operations reporting  the level at which significance should be measured  and c in applying the paragraph  the factors to consider in determining whether the selling entity has retained significant continuing involvement in the disposed component 
in the first quarter of  we identified the optoelectronics operations as a discontinued operation pursuant to eitf no 
and have presented the consolidated financial statements accordingly for all periods presented 

table of contents in addition  the eitf is currently discussing issue no 
c  accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences 
statement no 
provides guidance for accounting for compensated absences and states that an employer shall accrue a liability for employees compensation for future absences if certain conditions are met 
however  since certain compensated absences such as sabbatical leave do not typically vest  there is uncertainty whether employee rights to the compensated absence accumulate and meet the conditions of statement no 
currently  we do not accrue for sabbatical leave until the employee vests  and do not believe the resolution of the issue will have a material impact on our financial statements 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on operating costs and expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cash equivalents  short term and long term investments our investments in cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are comprised of highly rated  short and long term investments  such as us government agencies  corporate debt securities  commercial paper and other such low risk investments  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of these investments are held at fair value 
although we manage investments under an investment policy  economic  market and other events may occur which we cannot control 
although the risks are minimal  fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted because of changes in interest rates and credit ratings 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer principal losses if we were to sell securities that have declined in value because of changes in interest rates or issuer credit ratings 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading speculative purposes 
we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially impacted by an immediate change in interest rates 
debt our convertible subordinated notes due in have a fixed interest rate of 
consequently  we do not have significant interest rate cash flow exposure on our long term debt 
however  the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes is subject to significant fluctuations due to their convertibility into shares of our stock and other market conditions 
the fair value of these convertible subordinated notes is also sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of the us interest rates 
the notes do not contain significant restrictive covenants 
we would also be exposed to interest rate risk  if we used additional financing to fund capital expenditures 
the interest rate that we may be able to obtain on financings will depend on market conditions at that time and may differ from the rates we have secured in the past 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments and convertible subordinated notes as of december  in thousands cost fair value cash and cash equivalents including unrealized gains of available for sale investments including unrealized losses of  convertible subordinated notes 
table of contents foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica and germany 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican operations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
we engage in limited foreign currency hedging transactions  principally to lock in the cost of purchase commitments and to hedge material cash flows that are not denominated in us dollars  in accordance with a foreign exchange risk management policy approved by our board of directors 
we primarily use currency forward contracts for this purpose 
this hedging activity will reduce  but may not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
as of december  and  the notional amounts of forward currency exchange contracts outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts of the contracts designated as cash flow hedges at december  and  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the contracts designated as balance sheet hedges at december   were approximately million 
we had no contracts designated as balance sheet hedges at december
