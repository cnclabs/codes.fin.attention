item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the starpoint acquisition received approval by the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york in an order issued on january  we also used a portion of the cash available under the capitalsource revolving credit facility  together with funds provided by a day million bridge loan the capitalsource bridge loan  to finance the coastal acquisition 
the remainder of the purchase price of the coastal acquisition was paid from cash on hand  including the proceeds which we received from the sale of our us virgin islands materials operations 
continuing with our operational focus on electronic security services  on november   we signed an agreement and plan of merger between us  devcon acquisition  inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours  and guardian in which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of guardian security services inc we completed the 
table of contents acquisition of guardian on march   for an estimated aggregate cash purchase consideration of approximately million 
this purchase consideration consisted of i approximately million paid to the holders of the common stock of guardian  ii approximately million paid to redeem two series of guardian s preferred stock  iii approximately million used to assume and pay specified guardian debt obligations and expenses and iv approximately million used to satisfy specified expenses incurred by guardian in connection with the merger 
the balance of the purchase consideration  approximately million  has been placed in escrow 
subject to reconciliation based upon rmr and net working capital levels as of closing and subject to other possible adjustments  guardian common shareholders are expected to receive a pro rata distribution from the escrowed amount approximately six months after the closing 
the merger was approved by shareholders of guardian on february  to finance the guardian acquisition  we issued to certain investors under the terms of a securities purchase agreement  dated as of february   an aggregate principal amount of million of notes along with warrants to acquire an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire on the third anniversary of their issuance on march  and will be valued using a discounted cash flow model which takes into account the exercise price  volatility of the company s stock and the company s stock price at issuance 
the notes bear interest at a rate equal to per annum which rate increases to per annum in the event we fail to make payments required under the notes when due 
we also increased the amount of cash available under the capitalsource revolving credit facility from million to million and used million under this facility to finance the remaining purchase consideration of the guardian acquisition  repay the million capitalsource bridge loan and to increase working capital 
for further information on our indebtedness  see item a risk factors 
we anticipate that under the terms of the securities purchase agreement  the private placement investors will subsequently receive an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share  to be issued by us with a liquidation preference equal to  convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to per share for each share of series a convertible preferred stock 
the conversion price of the series a convertible preferred stock and the exercise price of the warrants issued with the notes will be subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
the issuance of the new series a convertible preferred stock and of the warrants could also cause the issuance of greater than of our outstanding shares of common stock upon the conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants 
our board has approved the creation of a new class of preferred stock and the creation of the series a convertible preferred stock  as well as the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock and the warrants 
the creation of a new class of preferred stock is subject to shareholder approval under florida law  while  for various reasons related to the potential issuance of greater than of our outstanding shares of common stock  the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock requires shareholder approval under the rules of nasdaq 
on february   holders of more than of our common stock approved the amendment to our articles of incorporation creating a new class of preferred stock and the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock  however  this approval will not be effective until the securities exchange commission rules and regulations relating to the delivery of an information statement on schedule c to our shareholders have been fully satisfied 
we anticipate that the sale of the shares of series a convertible preferred stock will take place on or before july  but not later than january  financial information about segments the following table sets forth financial highlights of our electronic security services  construction and materials divisions

electronic security services general 
unless otherwise noted  the financial results of our electronic security services division are as of december   and do not give effect to our acquisition of guardian  which is a material transaction 
in addition  our historical results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  include the operations of starpoint and coastal only from february  and november   the respective dates of acquisition for both companies 
as a result  our results of operations for the years ended december   and are not comparable in various material respects and are not indicative of the results which would have occurred had the acquisitions been completed at the beginning of the applicable period 
our revenue from electronic security services in was derived from contractual recurring revenue  service revenue and installation revenue  as set forth below 
contractual recurring revenue is the amount of service revenue quantified in our 
table of contents monitoring or service contract which is billed on a periodic recurring basis from service contract start date to completion 
throughout this annual report  we use the term rmr which means recurring monthly revenues indicating that a defined dollar amount is billed each month and revenue is recognized upon delivery of service and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
dollars in thousands year ended december  contractually recurring revenue service revenue installation revenue total business strategy 
the electronic security services industry is highly competitive and consists of regional and national providers 
our business strategy is based on building a leading regional presence 
specifically  we believe that the most effective way to build brand recognition  maximize market share  and boost operating efficiencies is to become a market leader in targeted regions that have favorable demographics and characteristics 
we believe that developing a familiar  community oriented brand is more effective than developing a national brand and will allow us to reach a top market share position in the areas we choose to operate 
we seek to develop a leading regional presence in growth markets in regions that have favorable demographic and population growth trends  as well as customer density opportunities that can be leveraged 
our first target region is in the southeast  with a primary focus on the state of florida 
our acquisition of starpoint provided an attractive  scalable platform for south florida 
our acquisition of sec delivered a strong customer base in the florida panhandle 
we believe our acquisition of coastal and our recent acquisition of guardian delivered the critical mass necessary to be able to leverage revenue and net earnings synergy opportunities which we believe will be significant 
our immediate focus will be on the successful integration of coastal and guardian leveraging the technology and back office platforms to ensure a timely integration 
however  we will continue to evaluate additional regional acquisition opportunities if and as they arise 
integration 
an important aspect of our acquisition program is the integration of subscriber accounts into our operations after the purchase 
depending on the size  frequency and location of acquisitions  the integration of subscribers may adversely affect the provision of field repair services to existing subscribers  which may cause subscriber attrition to increase 
in addition  if our corporate or branch operations fail to integrate a substantial portion of  or do not adequately service  acquired subscriber accounts  we may experience higher attrition in the future 
acquisitions of portfolios of subscriber accounts involve a number of risks  including the possibility of unanticipated problems not discovered prior to the acquisition  higher than expected account attrition and the diversion of management s attention from other business activities in order to focus on the integration of accounts 
for acquisitions that are structured as stock purchases of other companies  we may assume unexpected liabilities and must dispose of unnecessary or undesirable assets of the acquired companies 
for additional considerations and risks arising during the integration process see item a risk factors our inability to continue to acquire businesses in the security services business or successfully integrate these businesses could have adverse consequences on our business 
customer concentration 
the electronic security services division is not dependent upon any single customer  as no customer was responsible for more than of the division s total net revenues in our electronic security services division is concentrated in florida and the new york geographic markets 
recurring monthly revenue 
we believe the electronic security systems monitoring industry presents an attractive opportunity for predictable recurring revenues 
our relationship with our customers begins with an initial consultation to determine the potential customers needs and is followed by an equipment and service proposal 
our customers then sign contracts with us that allow us to provide ongoing electronic security systems monitoring services after the installation as needed of an electronic security system 
our contracts range from to years in length  and the length of the customer relationship often tends to exceed these terms 

table of contents monitoring commercial and residential 
the electronic security services division provides electronic security services and products to financial institutions  industrial and commercial businesses and complexes  warehouses  facilities of government departments and health care and educational facilities  as well as residential customers 
the division sells  installs  monitors and maintains electronic security systems and products located at its customers premises 
these systems and products include electronic monitoring services that provide intrusion and fire detection and  in the case of commercial monitoring  also include access control systems and closed circuit television  which is tailored to the customer s specific needs 
as of december   we had approximately  retail  commercial and residential customers under contract  some of which commercial customers have multiple locations 
installation  service and maintenance 
as part of its effort to provide high quality service to its commercial and residential customers  our electronic security services division maintains a trained installation  service and maintenance force 
these employees are trained to install and service the various types of commercial and residential security systems marketed by us 
subcontracted personnel are utilized where appropriate 
product sourcing 
we do not manufacture any of the components used in our electronic security services businesses 
due to the general availability of the components used in our electronic security services business  we are able to obtain the components of our systems from a number of different sources and to supply our customers with the latest technology generally available in the industry 
we are not dependent on any single source for our supplies and components and have not experienced any material shortages of components 
monitored electronic security systems 
our electronically monitored security systems involve the use  on a customer s premise  of devices designed to detect or react to various occurrences or conditions  such as intrusions  movement  fire  smoke  flooding  environmental conditions including temperature or humidity variations  industrial operations such as water  gas or steam pressure and process flow controls and other hazards 
in most systems  these detection devices are connected to a microprocessor based control panel which communicates through telephone lines to a monitoring center where alarm and supervisory signals are received and recorded 
systems may also incorporate an emergency panic button  which when pushed causes the control panel to transmit an alarm signal that takes priority over other alarm signals 
in most systems  control panels can identify the nature of the alarm and the areas within a building where the sensor was activated and transmit the information to a monitoring center 
depending upon the type of service for which the subscriber has contracted  monitoring center personnel respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to the local fire or police departments  notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action  such as dispatching employees to the customer s premises 
security systems utilize a digital communicator which responds to an event by dialing the monitoring center through the customer s regular telephone line 
if a control panel or the telephone line is not functioning properly  the monitoring center may not be alerted 
in most markets  systems transmission capabilities can be backed up through radio frequency transmission or the local cellular telephone network 
regulation 
our electronic security services division s operations are subject to a variety of federal  state  county and municipal laws  regulations and licensing requirements 
many local authorities require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct a security services business 
certain governmental entities also require persons engaged in the electronic security systems business to be licensed and to meet certain standards in the selection and training of employees and in the conduct of business 
we believe that we are in compliance with all such licensing and regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
in addition  municipalities and other localities are attempting to reduce the level of false alarms through various measures  such as the licensing of individual electronic security systems and the imposition of fines for false alarms  revocation of licenses and refusing to respond to alarms after a certain number of false alarms 
while such laws  regulations and licensing requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our business to date  we are unable to predict whether such statutes or ordinances  or any similar statutes or ordinances enacted by other jurisdictions  will adversely affect future business and operations 
the electronic security services industry is also subject to the oversight and requirements of various insurance  approval  listing and standards organizations 
adherence to the standards and requirements of such organizations may be mandatory or voluntary depending upon the type of customer served  the nature of the security service provided and the requirements of the local governmental jurisdiction 
we have not had any material difficulties in complying with such standards and requirements in the past 

table of contents our electronic security services business relies upon the use of telephone lines to transmit signals  and the cost of such lines and the type of equipment which may be utilized are currently regulated by both the federal and state governments 
competition 
the electronic security services business is highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price in relation to the quality of service provided 
sources of competition in the security services business are other providers of central monitoring services  systems directly connected to police and fire departments  local electronic security systems and other methods of protection 
the central monitoring sector of the electronic security services business is characterized by high fixed costs  but has low marginal costs associated with monitoring additional customers 
despite the opportunity for economies of scale by consolidation of monitoring and administrative functions  the industry is highly fragmented 
our electronic security services division competes with other major firms which have substantial resources  including adt security services  inc a subsidiary of tyco international limited  brinks home security  inc and protection one  inc  as well as many smaller regional and local companies 
many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater resources than we do and also may possess greater local market knowledge 
business development and facilities 
we entered the electronic security services business in with the acquisition of sec and its facility in panama city  florida  from which approximately  subscribers homes and businesses were serviced 
sec customers at the time of acquisition were monitored by coastal in accordance with the terms of a third party monitoring agreement 
during  we have significantly expanded this business with the starpoint acquisition in february  which added to our facilities a modern  full service monitoring center located in naples  florida  from which approximately  commercial and residential customers under contract were monitored  as well as additional sales and services offices in boca raton  bonita springs  miami  naples  orlando and tampa  florida 
the coastal acquisition  in november  added to our facilities a full service ul underwriter s laboratories certified monitoring center located in boca raton  florida  from which it monitored and serviced approximately  homes and businesses 
in january  the naples  florida monitoring center was closed and all customer monitoring was transferred to the boca raton monitoring center 
in addition  we completed the guardian acquisition in march  which expanded even more dramatically these operations and added two buildings to our facilities 
these buildings house a central monitoring station  offices and warehouse facilities  located in hollywood  florida and new york  new york from which it monitored and serviced approximately  homes and businesses  as well as additional sales and service offices in miami ft 
lauderdale  west palm beach  tampa and orlando  florida and in new york city and staten island 
we are continuing to search for opportunities to expand this business through both acquisition of accounts or businesses and internal growth 
our goal is to expand the electronic security services division s customer base in both the commercial and residential sectors  while simultaneously retaining a high percentage of the division s existing commercial and residential customers by providing high quality service 
industry overview 
according to the sdm magazine industry forecast study  the security systems services industry in the united states generates total annual revenue of approximately billion 
the largest participants in this industry are adt security services  inc a subsidiary of tyco international limited  brinks home security  inc  protection one  inc 
and honeywell 
these firms are larger and have significantly greater resources than we do and also may possess greater local market knowledge 
demand is driven partly by home sales  new home construction  and new commercial and office construction 
the central monitoring sector of the electronic security services business is characterized by high fixed costs  but has low marginal costs associated with monitoring additional customers 
despite the opportunity for economies of scale by consolidation of monitoring and administrative functions  the industry is highly fragmented 
large companies have advantages of scale in operating monitoring centers and in national advertising and brand recognition 
small companies often compete by selling customer contracts to the large monitoring companies  or reselling the monitoring companies services  which they buy wholesale 
major products are the manufacture  sale  installation and monitoring of electronic security systems 
the industry consists of commercial and residential segments  each of which uses different types of equipment and monitoring 
many companies operate in only one segment 
the commercial segment accounts for about percent of industry revenue 
the main components of a security system are door  window and motion sensors  control keypads  alarms  and communications modules 

table of contents construction general 
historically  we have completed construction projects  including interstate highways  airport sites and runways  deep water piers and marinas  waterway dredging  golf courses  and industrial  residential and commercial site development  primarily in the caribbean 
the revenue related to the work performed by our construction division is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
currently  the majority of our contracts are completed in less than one year 
the work is bid or negotiated at a fixed price or at a unit price where our fee is based upon the quantity of work performed and is often measured in yards  meters or tons rather than time or a time and materials basis 
changes in the scope of the work that are requested by the customer are included in the contract value when duly authorized and agreed upon 
we perform the majority of our work utilizing our internal labor and equipment resources 
operations 
we obtain leads for new projects from customers  engineering firms and architectural firms with whom we have established relationships 
first  we decide whether to submit a bid or negotiate to undertake a particular project 
we prepare and submit timely proposals detailing what we believe will best meet the customers objectives 
we have also provided long term or short term financing from time to time to certain customers to obtain construction contracts 
during  we financed  of construction projects and  as of the end of  there were outstanding balances totaling million  including principal and interest 
the amount of customer financing is projected to increase over the next year 
the company s president of the construction division reviews all project proposals and bids 
after a customer accepts our proposal  a formal contract is prepared and negotiated between the parties 
we assign one of our project managers to maintain close contact with the customer and their project engineers 
other staff is assigned to supervise personnel and the relocation  purchase  lease and maintenance of equipment 
construction management is responsible for the scheduling and monitoring of our operations 
backlog 
our backlog of unfulfilled portions of construction contracts at december  was approximately million  involving projects 
this compares to million  involving projects at december  one contract represents while another represents of the total backlog 
a us virgin island contract represents million and a bahamian project represents million of the balance 
the bahamian project is a related party transaction as noted in note  related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements 
between december  and march   we entered into new construction contracts in the caribbean 
we presently expect the operation to have increased revenue in and anticipate  although there is no assurance that this will occur  most of the million backlog will be completed in bonding 
we are required by the customer to obtain a performance bond to bid on certain construction contracts 
customers 
our primary customers are principally large private and government entities located throughout the caribbean 
during  we provided services to customers which generated contract revenue of million in the year 
three customers represent a concentration of more than of construction revenue 
those three customers represent  and individually or of total construction division revenue in the company and a member of our board of directors are minority shareholders in the customer representing of construction revenue 
related party transactions are further described in note  related party transactions  to our consolidated financial statements 
competition 
land development construction is extremely competitive 
we compete with smaller local contractors as well as larger us and european based contractors in all our markets 
primary competitive factors include price  prior experience  and relationships  the equipment available to complete the job  innovation  the available engineering staff to assist an owner in minimizing costs  how quickly a company can complete a contract  and the ability to obtain bonding which guarantees contract completion 
business development 
the construction division is experiencing growth attributable to the development of a tourism based economy and certain infrastructure redevelopment projects throughout the caribbean 
equipment 
our businesses require us to lease or purchase and maintain equipment 
as of december   our equipment included cranes  bulldozers  road graders  rollers  backhoes  earthmovers  hydraulic dredges and barges 
at certain times  a part of this equipment will be idle in between construction jobs until suitable construction contracts are found 
materials general 
the description below of our materials division  as of december   gives effect to the divestiture of our operations in the us virgin islands but does include the operating results of antigua  since the antigua operations were 
table of contents sold on march  subsequent to our december  year end 
in addition  our historical results of operations for the years ended december  and have been revised to exclude results of operations of the us virgin islands operations so as to provide comparability of results 
in  we manufactured and distributed ready mix concrete  block and crushed aggregate 
we also distributed bagged cement 
our sales can be segregated into the following groups dollars in thousands december  revenue net of intersegment sales ready mix concrete aggregates concrete block cement other the different activities on the islands are shown below ready mix concrete quarry and aggregates production concrete block production aggregates block sales cement sales puerto rico x x sint maarten x x x st 
martin x x x x antigua x x x x x our materials division employed assets in such as quarry related equipment aggregates processing plants concrete block plants concrete batch plants concrete mixer and pump trucks asphalt plants on march   the company sold our quarry operations in antigua see note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements 
ready mix concrete and concrete block 
our concrete batch plants mix cement  sand  crushed stone  water and chemical additives to produce ready mix concrete for use in local construction 
on most islands  concrete mixer trucks owned and operated by various third parties deliver the concrete to the customer s job site 
at our concrete block plant in antigua  a low moisture concrete mixture is machine formed  then dried and stored for later sale 
we believe our ready mix concrete operations and concrete block plants are among the largest in the caribbean islands on which we trade 
quarry operations  crushed stone and aggregate production 
we own or lease quarry sites at which we blast rock from exposed mineral formations 
this rock is sold as boulders or crushed to sizes ranging from inch stones down to manufactured sand 
the resulting aggregate is then sorted  cleaned and stored 
the aggregate is sold to customers and used in our operations to make concrete products 
we believe our quarries  except for puerto rico  are the largest on the caribbean islands in which we trade 
we believe that it is less expensive to manufacture aggregate at our quarries than to import from off island sources 

table of contents bagged cement 
we purchase bulk and bagged cement from local cement terminals on the islands for use in our concrete batch plant  block plants and on some islands for resale in the form of bagged cement 
supplies 
we presently obtain all of the crushed rock and a majority of the sand necessary for our production of ready mix concrete from our own quarries 
we believe our ability to produce our own sand and stone gives us a competitive advantage because of the substantial investment required to produce aggregates  the difficulty in obtaining the necessary environmental permits to establish quarries and the moratorium on mining beach sand imposed by most caribbean countries 
we purchase cement from cement terminals located on the islands where our operations are established 
leasing of concrete trucks and other equipment 
in st 
martin  sint maarten  and antigua  substantially all of our concrete trucks and concrete pump trucks have been sold or are leased to former employees that are now in the concrete delivery and pumping business 
in some of our quarries we have outsourced the drilling for blasting holes and some of the loading and movement of rock material 
also  we have in some instances sold or leased equipment to former employees or third parties for them to perform work for us 
the overall effect of these decisions has been a reduction of fixed costs  resulting in a larger percentage of costs being variable with revenue 
customers 
our primary customers are building contractors  governments  asphalt pavers and individual homeowners 
customers generally pick up quarry products  concrete block and bagged cement at our facilities  and we generally deliver ready mix concrete to the customers job sites 
no customer was responsible for more than of materials revenue at december  competition 
we have competitors in the materials business in the locations where we conduct business 
the competition includes local ready mix concrete and concrete block plants  and importers of aggregates and concrete blocks 
we also encounter competition from the producers of asphalt  which is an alternative material to concrete for road construction 
most competitors  such as ready mix and concrete block producers  have a disadvantage compared to our material costs  but have an advantage over us in respect to lower overhead costs 
business development 
we obtain our leads and proposed project information from architects  engineers  customers  local departments of transportation and local ministries of works with whom we have established relationships 
divestiture of us virgin islands and antigua operations 
as a part of our revised strategic focus on businesses with more predictable recurring revenue  on september   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  vi cement building products  inc  a delaware corporation  sold certain assets of ours constituting our us virgin islands ready mix concrete  aggregates  concrete block and cement materials and supplies business to heavy materials  llc  a us virgin islands limited liability company and private investor group 
the purchase price for this sale was million in cash plus an additional amount equal to the net realizable value of accounts receivable and certain assets associated with these operations as of the closing date  september  the net realizable value was paid by the purchaser on the closing date by issuance of a promissory note to us in an aggregate principal amount of million with a term of three years bearing interest at per annum with only interest being paid quarterly in arrears during the first months and principal and accrued interest being paid quarterly principal being paid in equal quarterly installments for the remainder of the term of the note until the maturity date 
in addition  on march   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with a 
hadeed or his nominee and gary o rourke  under which we completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of antigua masonry products  ltd  a subsidiary of ours  the business of which constituted all of our materials operations in antigua amp 
in connection with this sale  the purchasers acknowledged that preferred shares of amp with a face value equal to european currency ec  us  as of the date of the sale collectively  the preferred shares are outstanding and owned beneficially and of record by certain third parties and that such preferred shares are reflected as debt on amp s books and records 
the purchasers further acknowledged that their acquisition of amp was subject to the preferred shares and that the purchasers have sole responsibility of satisfying and discharging all obligations represented by such preferred shares  which represents an aggregate amount slightly in excess of  under the terms of this stock purchase agreement  the purchasers acquired  common shares of amp for a purchase price equal to million  subject to certain adjustments 
this purchase price was paid entirely in cash 
in addition  the transaction included transfers of certain assets from the antigua operations to us  as well as pre closing transfers to amp of certain preferred shares in amp that were owned by us 
the purchasers have agreed to pay all taxes incurred as a result of the sale

table of contents tax exemptions and benefits some of our offshore earnings are not taxed or are taxed at rates lower than us statutory federal income tax rates due to tax exemptions and tax incentives 
the us virgin islands economic development commission edc granted us tax exemptions on most of our us virgin islands earnings through march we have applied for an extension of this tax exemption  however  there is no guarantee that it will be granted 
the edc completed a compliance review on our subsidiary in the us virgin islands on february  the compliance review covered the period from april through march  and resulted from our application to request an extension of tax exemptions from the edc 
the edc s compliance report cited our failure to make gross receipts tax payments of  and income tax payments of million  not including interest and penalties 
this was the first time that a position contrary to our or any position on this specific issue had been raised by the edc 
in light of these events  and based on discussions with legal counsel  we established a tax accrual at december  for such exposure which approximated the amounts set forth in the edc review report 
in september and  the statute of limitations with respect to the income tax return filed by us for the year ended december  and  respectively  expired 
accordingly  in the third quarter of and  we reversed  and million respectively of the tax accrual established at december  we have not had recent communication with the edc regarding this matter and if challenged by the us virgin islands taxing authority would vigorously contest its position 
these tax accrual matters have been included in the results of discontinued operations 
for periods after december   we have accrued but on the advice of virgin islands counsel  not remitted  gross receipts taxes  which would be due should our application for an extension of benefit be withdrawn or denied 
we have been further advised by virgin islands counsel that  should the application of benefits be denied  the us virgin islands internal revenue bureau would  most likely  waive any penalties for late payment of gross receipts taxes through the date of denial  although no assurance can be given that such waiver would be granted 
following the sale of the us virgin islands ready mix concrete  aggregates  concrete block and concrete materials business in september   the company will not be generating any additional revenue which is covered under the applications for extension benefits 
accordingly  the accrual for this gross receipts tax exposure at december  was million and will remain unchanged in the future pending resolution of the application for extension 
us tax laws provide that certain of our offshore earnings are not taxable for us federal income tax purposes  and most post april earnings from our materials business in the us virgin islands can be distributed to us free of us income tax

in december  we distributed million of the earnings from one of our subsidiaries in antigua 
the distribution was made under the benefit of a deemed payment provision of a settlement agreement between the company and the government of antigua and barbuda 
the settlement agreement with the government of antigua and barbuda provided for withholding tax credits of million for dividend distributions made by the company from antigua through the years to at december   million of accumulated earnings had not been distributed to the parent company 
during  we distributed million of dividends from antigua using million of the withholding tax credits 
the company distributed an additional million of earnings before the sale of the materials division subsidiaries in antigua using another million of the withholding tax credits 
the company intends to use the remaining million of withholding tax credit to the extent it generates profits in its construction operations or distributes dividends from it remaining antigua operations

table of contents subsequent events acquisition of guardian private placement of notes and warrants 
on march   we completed the acquisition of guardian international  inc under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of november   between us  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours  and guardian in which we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of guardian for an estimated aggregate cash purchase consideration of approximately million 
this purchase consideration consisted of i approximately million paid to the holders of the common stock of guardian  ii approximately million paid to redeem two series of guardian s preferred stock  iii approximately million used to assume and pay specified guardian debt obligations and expenses and iv approximately million used to satisfy specified expenses incurred by guardian in connection with the merger 
the balance of the purchase price  approximately million  has been placed in escrow 
subject to reconciliation based upon recurring monthly revenue and net working capital levels as of closing and subject to other possible adjustments  guardian s common shareholders are expected to receive a pro rata distribution from the escrowed amount approximately six months after the closing 
the merger was approved by shareholders of guardian on february  in addition  in order to finance the acquisition of guardian  on march   we issued to certain investors under the terms of a securities purchase agreement  dated as of february   an aggregate principal amount of million of notes along with warrants to acquire an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we also increased the amount of cash available under the capitalsource revolving credit facility from million to million and used million under this facility together with the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and warrants to purchase guardian and repay the million capitalsource bridge loan 
the notes accrue interest at per annum and mature the earlier of july  or the date we obtain shareholder approval for issuance of the preferred shares discussed below 
additionally  the interest is payable at maturity which is expected to be on or before july   but not later than january  the allowable circumstances for the maturity date to extend beyond july  to a date prior to january  must arise from the time possibly needed for the securities and exchange commission to complete its review  if any  of an information statement to be filed with the securities and exchange commission and ultimately delivered by us to our shareholders in connection with the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock 
we anticipate that under the terms of the securities purchase agreement  the private placement investors will subsequently receive an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share  to be issued by us with a liquidation preference presently equal to  per share the original purchase price per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends per share  and convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to per share of common stock into which converted 
this conversion price and the exercise price of the warrants issued with the notes are and will be subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
the issuance of the new series a convertible preferred stock and of the warrants could also cause the issuance of greater than of our outstanding shares of common stock upon the conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants 
our board has approved the creation of a new class of preferred stock and the creation of the series a convertible preferred stock  as well as the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock and the warrants 
the creation of a new class of preferred stock is subject to shareholder approval under florida law  while  for various reasons related to the potential issuance of greater than of our outstanding shares of common stock  the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock requires shareholder approval under the rules of nasdaq 
on february   holders of more than of the company s common stock approved the amendment to our articles of incorporation creating a new class of preferred stock and the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock  however  this approval will not be effective and the series a convertible preferred stock will not be issued until the securities and exchange commission rules and regulations relating to the delivery of an information statement on schedule c to our shareholders have been satisfied 
the company anticipates that the sale of the shares of the series a convertible preferred stock will take place on or before july   but not later than january  resignation and replacement of independent director 
on january   mr 
james r 
cast resigned from the board of directors 
mr 
cast was an independent director  as defined by nasdaq national market nasdaq 
in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule c  requiring a majority of our board of directors to be independent  nasdaq notified us it had until the earlier of the next annual shareholders meeting or january  to replace the independent director position or face delisting 
on february   mr 
p 
rodney cunningham was appointed to our board of directors 
nasdaq has determined that we are in compliance with the rule and the matter is now closed 
divestiture of antigua operations 
on march   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with a 
hadeed or his nominee and gary o rourke  under which we completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of amp 
in connection with this sale  the purchasers acknowledged that preferred shares of amp with a face value equal to ec  us  as of the date of the sale are outstanding and owned beneficially and of record by certain third parties and that such preferred shares are reflected as debt on amp s books and records 
the purchasers further acknowledged that their acquisition of amp was subject to the preferred shares and that the purchasers have sole responsibility of satisfying and discharging all obligations represented by such preferred shares  which represents an aggregate amount slightly in excess of  under the terms of this stock purchase agreement  the purchasers acquired  common shares of amp for a purchase price equal to million  subject to certain adjustments 
this purchase 
table of contents price was paid entirely in cash 
in addition  the transaction included transfers of certain assets from the antigua operations to us  as well as pre closing transfers to amp of certain preferred shares in amp that were owned by us 
the purchasers have agreed to pay all taxes incurred as a result of the sale 
divestiture of joint venture assets of puerto rico crushing company prcc  on march   we reached a verbal agreement in principal whereby mr 
jose criado  through a company controlled by him  would purchase the fixed assets and substantially all of the inventory of prcc  our wholly owned subsidiary  as well as assume substantially all employee related severance costs and liabilities arising from the lease agreement including reclamation and leveling for the quarry land for a purchase price of  in cash and a two year note in an amount equal to the value of inventory as of the closing date 
if the negotiations are successful  we expect to complete the divestiture before the end of april the anticipated net proceeds from the sale will approximate the net book value of the related assets after giving effect to an impairment charge of approximately million recorded by the us during with respect to the long lived assets of prcc at december  independent to and prior to our reaching material agreement on the terms of the sale of prcc s assets to mr 
criado  we had performed an analysis of prcc s long lived assets for possible impairment in accordance with our accounting policies and statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  impairment of long lived assets 
the events which caused us to prepare the impairment analysis were the change of control of a major customer of prcc  causing reduced revenue in the second half of  the inability to obtain sufficient new revenue by december  to generate positive cash flows  and the january  termination of a november  letter of intent to sell materially all the assets of our remaining construction division  the remaining assets of our materials division and devmat assets 
more detailed information on the impairment analysis is included in note  impairment of long lived assets  to our consolidated financial statements 
the resulting impairment charge related to prcc s assets was million 
item a 
risk factors you should read and consider carefully each of the following factors  as well as the other information contained in  attached to or incorporated by reference in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the value of our stock could decline 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business operations 
risk factors relating to our business generally our officers and directors have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders 
our officers and directors beneficially own  directly or indirectly and  in the aggregate  a significant percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock and have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders 
we are subject to significant debt and debt service and will be subject to significant dividend service and redemption obligations which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
on november   our subsidiaries which comprise our electronic security services division entered into the million capitalsource revolving facility  the proceeds of which were used in part to pay down and cancel the million revolving credit facility provided by cit financial usa  inc  or the cit facility  and pay the purchase price of the coastal acquisition 
the capitalsource revolving credit facility was increased in march to contribute to the funding of the guardian acquisition and  as of december  and march   we had million and million  respectively  of borrowings outstanding 
in addition  in order to fund the remainder of the purchase price of the guardian acquisition  on march   we issued to certain investors an aggregate principal amount of million of notes  which notes we anticipate will subsequently be exchanged for an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of  these notes and shares of series a convertible preferred stock will be subject to regular interest  principal payment or dividend payment and redemption obligations 
as a result of the foregoing transactions  we are now incurring significant interest expense 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have significant consequences  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for capital expenditures  potential acquisitions  and other purposes may be limited or financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all  
table of contents a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and repay our senior debt and notes and dividend and redemption obligations under the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock  which reduces the funds that would otherwise be available to us for our operations and future business opportunities  and fluctuations in market interest rates will affect the cost of our borrowings to the extent not covered by interest rate hedge agreements because our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
a default could result in acceleration of the indebtedness evidenced by the senior debt or the notes and permit our senior lenders to foreclose on our electronic security services assets 
in addition  our failure to comply with the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could permit holders of the series a convertible preferred stock to require us to redeem all  or a portion of  the outstanding principal amount of the series a convertible preferred stock and pay all accrued but unpaid dividends 
the capitalsource revolving facility contains a number of covenants imposing restrictions on our electronic security services division s ability to  among other things incur more debt  pay dividends  redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions or impair the ability of any subsidiary to make such payments to the borrower  make acquisitions or investments  revise existing capital structure or principal line of business  use assets as security in other transactions  enter into transactions with affiliates including extending loans to employees  engage in any sale leaseback or synthetic lease transaction  impair the terms of any material contract  merge or consolidate with others  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  guarantee obligations of another  create liens on our assets  and extend credit 
also  the notes contain a number of covenants imposing restrictions on our ability to incur more debt  create liens on our assets or make payments with respect to existing debt 
the capitalsource revolving facility contains financial covenants that require our subsidiaries which comprise our electronic security services division to meet a number of financial ratios and tests 
failure to comply with the obligations in the capitalsource revolving facility or the notes could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of this indebtedness or of other indebtedness  allowing our senior lenders to foreclose on our electronic security services assets 

table of contents we will be subject to a financial covenant under the series a convertible preferred stock which will restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
upon effectiveness of approval of the shareholders of the private placement and exchange of the million in notes for the series a convertible preferred stock  we will be subject to a financial covenant under the series a convertible preferred stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock contains a financial covenant imposing a restriction on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
as a result  so long as any shares of series a convertible preferred stock remain outstanding  we will not be able to allow our indebtedness ratio to exceed a specified maximum leverage amount 
our failure to comply with this indebtedness ratio covenant could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could permit holders of the series a convertible preferred stock to require us to redeem all  or a portion of  the outstanding principal amount of the series a convertible preferred stock and pay all accrued but unpaid dividends 
if we do not successfully implement our business strategy  we may not be able to repay or refinance our senior debt or the notes or comply with the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy or realize our anticipated financial results 
accordingly  our cash flows and capital resources may not be sufficient to pay the interest charges on and principal payments of our senior debt or notes or comply with the dividend payment and redemption provisions of the series a convertible preferred stock 
failure to pay our interest expense  make our principal payments  pay dividends or effect a redemption would result in a default 
a default relating to the senior debt  the notes or the series a convertible preferred stock  if not waived  could result in acceleration of the indebtedness evidenced by our senior debt and the notes  in which case the indebtedness would become immediately due and payable  or could permit holders of the series a convertible preferred stock to require us to redeem all  or a portion of  the outstanding principal amount of the series a convertible preferred stock and pay all accrued but unpaid dividends 
if this occurs  our substantial indebtedness and the redemption amount for the series a convertible preferred stock could have important consequences to us and may  among other things limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividend service requirements or other purposes  limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal payments and fund debt and dividend service and redemption requirements  cause us to be unable to satisfy our obligations under our existing or new debt agreements  the notes or the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock  make us more vulnerable to adverse general economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to compete with others who are not as highly leveraged as we are  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  industry and market conditions  cause us to sell assets  and cause us to obtain additional equity capital or refinance or restructure all or a portion of our outstanding senior debt or the notes 
in the event that we are unable to do so  we may be left without sufficient liquidity and may not be able to repay our senior debt or the notes 
in that case  the senior lenders would be able to foreclose on our assets 
even if new financing is available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
in the case of default relating to dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock  if not cured or waived  it could permit the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock to require us to redeem all  or a portion of  the outstanding principal amount of the series a convertible preferred stock and pay all accrued but unpaid dividends similarly  if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy or realize our anticipated financial results  we may not be able to comply with the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock concerning the payment of dividends or requiring us to redeem  for cash  all outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock  in equal installments  on the fourth  fifth and sixth anniversary of completion of the private placement 
if we fail to effect any required 
table of contents redemption of the series a convertible preferred stock  the applicable redemption amount per unredeemed share of series a convertible preferred stock will bear interest at the rate of per month until paid in full and the investors will have the option to require us to convert any of those unredeemed shares into shares of our common stock substituting market prices for the conversion price  which market prices may be lower than the conversion price resulting in a larger number of shares of our common stock being issued  resulting in greater dilution to our existing shareholders 
our stock is thinly traded 
while our stock trades on the nasdaq  our stock is thinly traded and you may have difficulty in reselling your shares quickly 
the low trading volume of our common stock is outside of our control  and we cannot guarantee that the trading volume will increase in the near future or that  even if it does increase in the future  it will be maintained 
without a large float  our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and  as a result  the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile 
in addition  in the absence of an active public trading market  an investor may be unable to liquidate his investment in us 
trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger 
we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future 
we do not currently pay any dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock in the last years 
we anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will continue to retain any earnings for use in the operation of our business  except as required to pay dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock to be issued following shareholder approval following the acquisition of guardian in march  any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors  after consideration of any restrictions on cash dividends as defined by our credit and debt agreements  and will depend on our earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
risk factors relating to our electronic security services division we intend to continue our strategy of developing a strong regional presence and  as a result  experience significant growth  some of which may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and existing business 
to date  we have acquired sec  starpoint  coastal and guardian and plan to continue to acquire additional electronic security service companies 
acquisitions can divert management s attention and result in greater administrative burdens and operating costs and  to the extent financed with debt  additional interest costs 
we may not be able to manage or integrate acquired companies or businesses successfully 
the success of our acquisition strategy will depend on  among other things the availability of suitable candidates  purchase price multiples which may escalate as a result of increased competition from other electronic security services companies for the purchase of available candidates  our ability to value those candidates accurately and negotiate favorable terms for those acquisitions  the availability of funds to finance acquisitions  and the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses 
financing for the acquisitions may come from several sources  including our existing cash on hand  the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants  the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of additional common stock  preferred stock  debt whether convertible or not or other securities 
the issuance of any additional securities could  among other things result in substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders at the time of issuance  result in the substantial dilution of our earnings per share  adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock  and result in increased indebtedness  which could negatively affect our liquidity and operating flexibility 

table of contents our inability to continue to acquire businesses in the electronic security services business could have adverse consequences on our results of operations 
due to the continuing consolidation of the electronic security systems industry and the acquisition by us and other electronic security systems companies of a number of large portfolios of subscriber accounts  there may in the future be fewer large portfolios of subscriber accounts available for acquisition 
we face competition for the acquisition of portfolios of subscriber accounts  and we may be required to offer higher prices for subscriber accounts we acquire in the future than we have offered in the past 
a core component of our regional strategy is the acquisition of electronic security services businesses which will enable us to develop a leading regional presence in certain targeted markets and benefit from the increased brand recognition  maximization of market share and improved operating efficiencies that we believe will accompany this position 
if we are unable to continue our acquisition program  we may be unable to achieve this regional presence in some or all of the markets we have targeted  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
integrating our acquired businesses may be disruptive to or cause an interruption of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the process of integrating our acquired businesses may be disruptive to our business and may cause an interruption or a loss of momentum in our business as a result of the following factors  among others loss of key employees or customers  higher than expected account attrition  possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information and other systems  failure to maintain the quality of services that the companies have historically provided  and the need to coordinate geographically diverse organizations 
these disruptions and difficulties  if they occur  may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings  revenue enhancements and other benefits from that integration and may cause material adverse short and long term effects on our operating results and financial condition 
inherent uncertainties associated with the acquisition of past or future acquisition candidates may cause us or the acquisition candidates to lose key employees 
employees of a past or future acquisition candidate may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the surviving corporation 
this uncertainty may adversely affect the surviving corporation s ability to retain key management  sales and marketing personnel 
many of these employees may be critical to the business and operations of the surviving corporation 
the loss of key personnel may imperil the acquisition of any such acquisition candidate or lead to disruptions of our operations 
the loss of key personnel also could result in a loss of key information  expertise and know how  which could result in future replacement costs associated with recruitment and training 
we may encounter difficulties implementing our business plan 
we expect that we will encounter challenges and difficulties in implementing our business plan 
these challenges and difficulties relate to our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers  generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through additional debt or equity financings to support our regional growth strategy  hire  train and retain sufficient additional financial reporting management  operational and technical employees  and install and implement new financial and other systems  procedures and controls to support our regional growth strategy with minimal delays 

table of contents if we encounter greater than anticipated difficulties in integrating our electronic security services division into our general corporate structure  it may be necessary to take additional actions  which could divert management s attention and strain our operational and financial resources 
we may not successfully address any or all of these challenges  and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business plan and results of operations  our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to achieve enhanced profitability 
each of sec  starpoint  coastal  and guardian operated on different technology platforms that will have to be integrated 
we plan to fully integrate the back office software platforms for each of our acquired operations for standard processes  including accounts payable receivable  human resources management  inventory management  customer service and other platforms to a single  unified platform 
each of sec  starpoint  coastal and guardian currently use a combination of different technology platforms for back office support and security systems monitoring that will have to be integrated to achieve our objectives of growth and profitability 
as with any technology switchover  we run the risk of potential operational challenges and service disruptions that could negatively impact our operations 
the development and recognition of our regional brand may not advance as quickly or as effectively as we anticipate 
our regional growth strategy requires a recognized brand in the geographic areas in which we operate 
in order to attract and retain the high quality customers we seek  we will have to develop and cultivate our brand 
there is no guarantee that our brand will be adopted or recognized as a market leader in security systems monitoring services or as a regional brand 
even if the brand is cultivated effectively  it may require more time than we anticipate and may affect our further implementation of our growth strategy 
our electronic security services operations are geographically concentrated making us vulnerable to economic and environmental risks inherent to those locations 
our existing subscriber base is geographically concentrated predominantly in florida and new york 
accordingly  our performance may be adversely affected by regional or local economic and environmental conditions  including weather conditions 
florida in particular is highly susceptible to the impact of hurricanes 
similarly  other unforeseen events  including war or terrorist activities could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may from time to time make acquisitions in regions outside of our current operating area as part of our regional focus 
the acquisition of companies in other regions  or in metropolitan areas in which we do not currently have subscribers  requires an investment by us 
in order for us to expand successfully into a new area  we must acquire companies with a sufficient number and density of subscriber accounts in that area to support the investment 
we may not be able to locate these opportunities or  even if we locate these opportunities  an expansion into these new geographic areas may not generate operating profits 
our electronic security services division operates in a highly competitive environment and we may not be able to compete effectively for customers  causing us to lose all or a portion of our market share 
the electronic security services business in the united states is highly competitive 
new competitors are continually entering the field 
competition is based primarily on price in relation to quality of service 
sources of competition in the electronic security services business are other providers of central monitoring services  local electronic security systems and other methods of protection  such as manned guarding 
our electronic security services division competes with other major firms which have substantial resources  including adt security services  inc a subsidiary of tyco international limited  brinks home security  a division of the brinks company  protection one  and honeywell protection services  a division of honeywell  inc  as well as many smaller regional and local companies 
many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater resources than we do and may possess greater local market knowledge as well 
we may not be able to continue to compete effectively for existing or potential customers  causing us to lose all or a portion of our market share 

table of contents our electronic security services division is subject to significant government regulation and the failure to substantially comply with one or more of these regulations could adversely affect our electronic security services division s business and results of operations 
our electronic security services division s operations are subject to a variety of federal  state  county and municipal laws  regulations and licensing requirements 
the states in which we operate  as well as some local authorities  require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our electronic security service business 
in addition  there has been a recent trend on the part of municipalities and other localities to attempt to reduce the level of false alarms through various measures  such as licensing of individual electronic security systems and the imposition of fines upon customers  revocation of licenses or non response to alarms after a certain number of false alarms 
while these statutes and ordinances have not had a material effect on our business operations to date  we are not able to predict whether these statutes or ordinances  or similar statutes or ordinances enacted by other jurisdictions  will adversely affect our business in the future 
the electronic security services industry also is subject to the oversight and requirements of various insurance  approval  listing and standards organizations 
adherence to the standards and requirements of these organizations may be mandatory or voluntary depending upon the type of customer served  the nature of the electronic security services provided and the requirements of governmental jurisdiction 
the nature of the services provided by our electronic security services division potentially exposes us to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or product liability than may be inherent in many other service businesses 
cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our electronic security services division 
the operating results of our electronic security services division may be adversely affected by the general cyclical pattern of the electronic security services industry 
demand for electronic security services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending  which attrition would adversely affect our results of operations 
our electronic security services division s business is subject to attrition of subscriber accounts 
our electronic security services division experiences attrition of subscriber accounts as a result of  among other factors  relocation of subscribers  adverse financial and economic conditions  and competition from other electronic security system companies 
in addition  our electronic security services division experiences attrition of newly acquired accounts to the extent that we do not integrate these accounts or do not adequately service those accounts or because of dissatisfaction with prior service 
attrition and an increase in attrition rates could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
when acquiring accounts  we seek to withhold a portion of the purchase price as a partial reserve against subscriber attrition 
if the actual attrition rate for the accounts acquired is greater than the rate assumed by us at the time of the acquisition  and we are unable to recoup our damages from the portion of the purchase price held back from the seller  such attrition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain purchase price holdbacks in future acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of large portfolios 
also  actual account attrition for acquired accounts may be greater than the attrition rate assumed or historically incurred by our electronic security services division 
the effects of gross subscriber attrition have historically been offset by adding new accounts from subscribers who move into premises previously occupied by prior subscribers and in which electronic security systems are installed  conversions of accounts that were previously monitored by other electronic security services companies to our monitoring services and accounts for which we obtain a guarantee from the seller that provides for us to put back to the seller canceled accounts 
the resulting figure is used as a guideline to determine the estimated life of subscriber revenues 
it is our policy to review periodically actual account attrition and  when necessary  adjust the remaining estimated lives of our purchased accounts to reflect assumed future attrition 
if actual account attrition significantly exceeds assumed attrition and we have to shorten the period over which we amortize the cost of purchased subscriber accounts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our future success is dependent  in part  on key personnel and failure to retain these key personnel would adversely affect our operation 
the future success or our electronic security services division depends significantly upon the efforts of certain key management personnel  such as stephen j 
ruzika  our chief executive officer and president  and a small group of other 
table of contents significant employees who we employed in connection with our recent acquisitions of electronic security services businesses 
the loss of the services of any of these officers or other key employees could materially and adversely affect our business as we would no longer be able to benefit from their knowledge  experience and guidance 
declines in new construction may affect our sales 
demand for electronic security monitoring services to detect intrusion and fire is tied  in part  to new construction 
the market for new construction and the real estate market in general are cyclical and  in the event of a decline in the market for new developments  it is likely that demand for our electronic security monitoring services to multi family dwellings would also decline  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
lower crime rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for the past several years crime rates have been dropping in the united states  particularly in the state of florida 
according to the florida department of law enforcement s annual uniform crime report  florida s index crime rate has reached a year low dropping by percent in  compared to particularly relevant to our business is the decrease in the number of burglaries 
while the number of homes and businesses with installed electronic security systems has continued to increase even as crime rates have decreased  this may not continue to be the case 
any significant decrease in the number of homes and businesses installing new electronic security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risk factors relating to our materials division and construction division we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may prevent us from being able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which could harm our business and operating results  the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 
in connection with the completion of its audit of  and the issuance of an unqualified report on  our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   our independent registered public accounting firm  kpmg  llp  communicated to our management and audit committee that certain matters involving our internal controls were considered to be material weaknesses  as defined under the standards established by the public company accounting oversight board 
see item a controls and procedures 
our independent registered public accounting firm informed our management and our audit committee that these material weaknesses related to their belief that we did not have sufficient controls pertaining to the review and oversight of financial results constituting material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and assess on an on going basis the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we are committed to continuously improving our internal controls and financial reporting 
we are working with consultants with experience in internal controls to assist management and the audit committee in reviewing our current internal controls structure with a view towards meeting the formalized requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
however  to the extent our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls  even if we are able to take remedial actions to correct the identified material weaknesses described above and any other material weaknesses identified as the evaluation and testing process is completed  there may be insufficient time for the remediated controls to be in operation to permit our independent registered public accounting firm to conclude that the remediated controls are effective 
thus  our independent registered public accounting firm would possibly provide an adverse opinion to the effect that our internal controls are ineffective as of the date of such evaluation  or may decline to issue an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
under current regulations  the company must be able to comply with the provision of section of the sarbanes oxley act of by our reporting period ending december  if we are unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective at such time that we will be required to attest to them  or if our independent registered public accounting firm concludes that our internal controls are ineffective at such time  or is unable to conclude that our assessment is fairly stated or is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms could be materially and 
table of contents adversely affected  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  our financial condition and the market value of our securities 
in addition  if we are unable to conclude our internal controls or disclosure controls are effective at such time that we will be required to attest to them  current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price could be negatively impacted 
we have agreed to settlement terms with respect to a dispute with a vendor of ours in st 
martin  however  the terms of the settlement have not yet been fulfilled and it is possible that the vendor could still pursue a claim against us 
on july   our subsidiary  societe des carrieres de grande case  or scgc  entered into an agreement with mr 
fernand hubert petit  mr 
francois laurent petit and mr 
michel andre lucien petit  collectively referred to as  petit  to lease a quarry located in the french side of st 
martin 
another lease was entered into by scgc on october  for the same and additional property 
another subsidiary of ours  bouwbedrijf boven winden  na  or bbw  entered into a material supply agreement with petit on july  this agreement was amended on october  under the terms of this amendment  we became a party to the materials supply agreement 
in may  we advised petit that we would possibly be removing our equipment within the timeframes provided in its agreements and made a partial quarterly payment under the materials supply agreement 
on june   petit advised us in writing that petit was terminating the materials supply agreement immediately because petit had not received the full quarterly payment and also advised that it would not renew the lease when it expired on october  petit refused to accept the remainder of the quarterly payment from us in the amount of  without prior notice to bbw  petit obtained orders to impound bbw assets on st 
martin the french side and sint maarten the dutch side 
the assets sought to be impounded include bank accounts and receivables 
bbw has no assets on st 
martin  but approximately  of its assets were impounded on sint maarten 
in obtaining the orders  petit claimed that million is due on the supply agreement the full payment that would be due by us if the contract continued for the entire potential term and we continued to mine the quarry  million is due for quarry restoration and million is due for pain and suffering 
the materials supply agreement provided that it could be terminated by us on july  in february  scgc  bbw and devcon entered into agreements with petit  which provided for the following the purchase by scgc of three hectares of partially mined land located within the quarry property previously leased from petit for approximately million  a two year lease of approximately hectares of land  or the hectare lease  on which scgc operates a crusher  ready mix concrete plant and aggregates storage at a cost of  the granting of an option to scgc to purchase two hectares of unmined property prior to december  for million  payable million on december  and million on december   subject to the terms below in the event that scgc exercises this option  petit agrees to withdraw all legal actions against us and our subsidiaries  in the event that scgc does not exercise the option to purchase and petit is subsequently awarded a judgment  scgc has the option to offset approximately million against the judgment amount and transfer ownership of the three hectare parcel purchased by scgc as stated above back to petit  the granting of an option to scgc to purchase five hectares of unmined land prior to june  for million  payable million on june  and million on june   and the granting of an option to scgc to extend the hectare lease through december  with annual rent of  if the two hectares are purchased and subsequent extensions of the lease with annual rent of  equal to the terms of mining authorizations obtained from the french government agencies 
after conferring with our french counsel and upon review by management  we believe that we have valid defenses and offsets to petit s claims  including  among others  those relating to our termination rights and the benefit to petit from us not mining the property 
based on the foregoing agreements and our review  management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
at the time we exercise the options discussed above  we will obtain independent appraisals to determine the fair value of any non cash consideration  including the exercise of the options discussed above  used in settlement of a judgment received by petit  if any 

table of contents we have entered into transactions with our affiliates which result in conflicts of interests 
we have entered into a number of transactions with our affiliates  including an investment in the caribbean involving companies in which certain of our current and former officers and directors have an interest 
material transactions are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements and the periodic reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
these transactions result in conflicts of interests 
our audit committee reviews and approves transactions between us and our affiliates  including our officers and directors 
our policy is that all of these transactions be reviewed and approved by the audit committee prior to completion 
in addition  our articles of incorporation provide that no contract or other transaction between us and any other corporation shall in any way be invalidated by the fact that any of our directors are interested in or are directors or officers of the other party to the transaction 
we are subject to some risks due to the nature of our foreign operations 
the majority of our continuing operations in were conducted in foreign countries located in the caribbean  primarily antigua and barbuda  sint maarten  st 
martin and the bahamas 
for the fiscal year ended december   of our revenue were derived from foreign geographic areas 
the risks of doing business in foreign areas include potential adverse changes in us diplomatic relations with foreign countries  changes in the relative purchasing power of the us dollar  hostility from local populations  adverse effects of exchange controls  changes in either import or export tariffs  nationalization  interest rate fluctuations  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings  government policies against businesses owned by non nationals  expropriations of property  the instability of foreign governments  any civil unrest or insurrection that could result in uninsured losses and other political  economic and regulatory conditions  risks or difficulties 
adverse changes in currency exchange rates or raw material commodity prices  both in absolute terms and relative to competitors risk profiles  could adversely impact our operations 
we are not subject to these risks in puerto rico or the us virgin islands  since these are united states territories 
we believe our most significant foreign currency exposure is the euro 
we are also subject to us federal income tax upon the distribution of certain offshore earnings 
although we have not encountered significant difficulties in our foreign operations  we could encounter difficulties in the future 
some of the contracts involved in contracting business have fixed price terms which do not take into account unanticipated changes in production costs  which we would not be able to pass on to the customer 
we generally enter into either fixed price contracts that provide for an established price that does not vary during the term of the contract or unit price contracts under which our fee is based on the quantity of work performed 
fixed price and unit price contracts  involve inherent risks  such as unanticipated increases in the cost of labor and or materials  subcontracts that were unexpected at the time of bidding  bidding errors  unexpected field conditions  adverse weather conditions  the inability of subcontractors to perform  work stoppages and other events beyond our control 
although our attempts to minimize the risks inherent in our contracts by  among other things  obtaining subcontracts from reliable subcontractors  anticipating labor and material cost increases  anticipating contingencies  utilizing our cost control system and obtaining certain cost escalation clauses  we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete our current or future contracts at a profit 
in addition  the longer the term of fixed price and unit price contracts  the greater the risks associated with that contract 
we may incur specified penalties or losses under some of the clauses in the contracts governing our projects 
some of our contracts call for project completion by a specified date and may contain a penalty clause for our failure to complete a project by this date 
during the year ended december   our construction division reported an operating loss of million compared to million of operating income for the corresponding period of this decrease was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in the estimated costs to complete a current marina project in the us virgin islands due to operational difficulties encountered during the year 
as a result  the anticipated gross margin on this project was reduced by more than million during the year  resulting in a loss on the project in of million 
in addition  under the terms of some of our contracts  we make warranties that extend for a period of time beyond the completion of these contracts 

table of contents our failure to enter into new contracts to replace completed contracts could have an adverse impact on our operations 
we endeavor to ensure that our contracting resources are effectively utilized and to that end pursue new contracts as the completion time for existing contracts approaches 
to the extent we have entered into contracts to which a significant part of our resources are committed  the failure to obtain new contracts upon the completion of these contracts could adversely affect our results of operations 
general economic conditions in the markets in which we conduct business could have a material impact upon our operations 
our construction division and our materials division are materially dependent upon economic conditions in general  including recession  inflation  deflation  general weakness in construction and housing markets  changes in infrastructure requirements and  in particular  upon the level of development and construction activities in the caribbean 
a general downturn in the economy in this region would adversely affect the housing and construction industry and  therefore  would adversely affect our contracting and concrete and related products businesses 
our materials and construction divisions operate in a highly competitive environment and we may not be able to compete effectively for customers  causing us to lose all or a portion of our market share 
we have competitors in the materials business in the locations where we conduct business 
the competition includes local ready mix concrete and local concrete block plants  and importers of aggregates and concrete blocks 
we also encounter competition from the producers of asphalt  which is an alternative material to concrete for road construction 
most competitors  such as ready mix and local concrete block producers  have a disadvantage compared to our material costs  but have an advantage over us in respect to lower overhead costs 
with respect to our construction division  land development construction is extremely competitive 
we compete with smaller local contractors as well as larger us and european based contractors in all our markets 
primary competitive factors include price  prior experience and relationships  the equipment available to complete the job  innovation  the available engineering staff to assist an owner in minimizing costs  how quickly a company can complete a contract  and the ability to obtain bonding which guarantees contract completion 
we are highly dependent on supplies of cement and barbuda sand and a failure to maintain adequate supplies would adversely affect our operations 
our operations are highly dependent upon our ability to acquire adequate supplies of cement  concrete block and barbuda sand 
we have experienced  in the past  and could experience in the future short term shortages of both cement and barbuda sand which  temporarily  adversely affected our operations 
some of our significant customers are governmental agencies of islands in the caribbean which may constitute a credit risk 
we operate on several islands in the caribbean 
the governmental agencies of these islands are significant customers 
many of the island governments  with which we conduct business  have high levels of public debt relative to their revenue base 
accordingly  we may experience difficulty in collecting amounts due from these governmental agencies 
we are highly dependent on the availability of barging and towing services in the caribbean 
our construction division is highly dependent upon the availability of barging and towing services to move construction materials and equipment from the united states to various caribbean islands and between caribbean islands 
our materials division is highly dependent upon the availability of barging services to import sand  cement and block 
we have experienced  in the past  and could experience in the future  a short term shortage of barging capacity which would have an adverse affect on our operations 
we are highly dependent upon having the ability to secure bid  payment  and performance bonds 
our construction division s ability to secure new contracts is dependent upon being able to obtain bid  payment and performance bonds 
we have no definitive bonding line 
one of the underwriting criteria of the bonding company  which we utilize  is tangible net worth 
our tangible net worth decreased significantly during due to our net loss and the increase in intangible assets and goodwill associated with the acquisitions of businesses in the electronic security division 
this reduced our tangible net worth which could negatively affect our ability to secure new construction contracts 

table of contents we are highly dependent upon the ability to secure work permits for employees 
our construction division is dependent upon being able to secure work permits from the various caribbean island governments for employees domiciled in other jurisdictions 
we could  in the future  experience delays in securing these work permits  which could adversely affect its ability to perform under its contracts 
we are highly dependent upon the ability to secure business licenses to operate in foreign jurisdictions  particularly in the bahamas 
our construction division competes for business  in some jurisdictions  with local contractors 
the governments in some of these foreign jurisdictions  particularly the bahamas  encourage the awarding of contracts to local contractors 
we may not  in the future  be able to secure all prerequisite business licenses to enter into or perform under construction contracts

item legal proceedings we are involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business  primarily in connection with our construction division 
in the fall of  virgin islands cement and building products  inc vicbp  a subsidiary of ours  was under contract with the virgin islands port authority vipa for the construction of the expansion of the st 
croix airport 
during the project  homeowners and residents of the yellow cedar housing community  located next to the end of the expansion project  claimed to have experienced several days of excessive dust in their area as a result of the ongoing construction work 
the homeowners of yellow cedar have filed two separate lawsuits for unspecified damages against vipa and vicbp as co defendants 
one suit  filed in the us district court for the district of the virgin islands by mariepaul antoine  benjamin ashe  et 
al  vs 
vipa et 
al  case  r f  seeks equitable relief from nuisance  specific performance and damages 
the second suit  louisa williams et 
al vs 
vipa et 
al filed in the territorial court of the usvi case seeks equitable relief from nuisance  specific performance and damages 
in both cases  vicbp  as defendant  has agreed to indemnify vipa for any civil action as a result of the construction work 
reliance insurance company reliance  the general liability carrier for vicbp during that period  has taken the legal position that dust is a pollutant and  therefore  the pollution exclusion clause applies and as a result denies liability insurance coverage to vicbp 
corporate counsel in florida  as well as in the us virgin islands  have advised us that laws now in place should enable us to enforce the duty to defend clause contained in the liability policy  thus affording usa defense for both legal actions 
the pennsylvania insurance commissioner placed reliance in rehabilitation in october  and subsequently into liquidation 
we have also presented claims under the policy to the florida insurance guaranty association  the vi insurance guaranty association  the pennsylvania insurance commissioner  and to our excess liability insurance carrier  zurich insurance company 
it is too early to predict the final outcome of this matter or to estimate our potential  if any  risk of loss

in the early s  the buildings 
table of contents began to develop exterior cracking and pop outs 
in november  bbw was named one of several defendants  including the building s insurer  in a suit filed by syndicat des copropri taires la r sidence le flamboyant condominium owners association of le flamboyant in the french court tribunal de grande instance de paris  case no 
a french court assigned an expert to examine the cause of the cracking and pop outs and to determine if the cracking pop outs are caused by a phenomenon known as alkali reaction ars 
the expert found  in his report dated december   that bbw was responsible for the ars 
the plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages  including demolition and replacement of the apartments 
based on the advice of legal counsel  a judgment assessed in a french court would not be enforceable against a netherlands antilles company 
thus  in order to obtain an enforceable judgment  the plaintiff would have to file a successful claim in an antillean court 
it is too early to predict the final outcome of this matter or to estimate the potential risk of loss  if any  to the company 
due to the lack of enforceability  the company decided not to continue the defense in the french court 
therefore  the company may not be aware of recent developments in the proceedings 
management believes our defenses to be meritorious and does not believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company

comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  summary during we continued to redeploy certain of our assets and make new investments into more predictable recurring revenue businesses by completing the following transactions within our electronic security services division in february  we purchased the electronic security services operations of starpoint limited starpoint from adelphia communications  in november  we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of boca raton  florida based coastal security company coastal  and in november  we entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired in march all of the outstanding capital stock of hollywood  florida based guardian international  inc guardian 
these acquisitions were accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
the results of these operations are included in the financial statements only from the respective acquisition dates  accordingly  the results of guardian have not been included in our financial results for any years presented 
the acquisitions were funded through cash on hand  proceeds from our million credit facility  and the issuance of million in new debt 
the new debt was issued 
table of contents contemporaneously with the closing of the guardian merger in march and  pending shareholder approval  will be repaid and replaced by convertible preferred stock with a liquidation preference equal to the  outstanding principal under the notes 
also  in september  we sold our us virgin island materials operation for million 
accordingly  the net operating results of this business are reported as discontinued operations for all years presented in our consolidated financial statements 
as presented in note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements  on march   we divested our antigua quarry  concrete and aggregate businesses for million 
in december we entered into a letter of intent to sell our construction division and our then remaining materials operation to a private investor group for million in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
in january  the private investor group notified us that it was no longer in a position to complete the transaction as set forth in the letter 
accordingly  negotiations regarding the transaction ceased 
concurrently with the private investor group negotiations  we performed a strategic review of our construction and materials operations to determine how we could improve the divisions performance and whether  in accordance with our accounting policies  our long lived assets employed in our construction and materials divisions required a charge for impairment in value 
as presented in note  impairment of long lived assets  to our consolidated financial statements  that review resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the combined effect of the acquisitions of the electronic security services business and the divestiture of the us virgin island and antiguan materials businesses is that our revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million of which million  or of total revenue  resulted from the electronic security services business 
since the results of the electronic security services operations were only included for the portions of the year subsequent to acquisition  revenues from the electronic security services in and beyond are expected to represent more than of our revenues 
in  our consolidated revenue from continuing operations amounted to million  an increase of million  or approximately a increase  compared to s revenue from continuing operations of million 
this revenue increase was principally due to a million and million increases recorded by our construction and electronic security services divisions  respectively 
our operating loss from continuing operations in increased million to million when compared to of million 
this significant decline was principally a result of our construction and materials divisions recording a combined decrease in gross profit of million  an increase of million in consolidated administration expenses and an impairment of assets charge of million  associated with our construction and materials divisions 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in gross margin recorded by our electonic security services division 
other income decreased million to an million expense in compared to million income in this decrease in other income was principally due to an million one time gain recorded in december for the settlement of an outstanding note receivable and pending claims with the government of antigua and barbuda combined with an increase in net interest expense of million from interest expense of million in compared to interest income of million in the interest expense increase is principally due to new borrowings incurred to acquire the electronic security services operations of adelphia communications as well as all the outstanding share capital of coastal security and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
net loss from continuing operations for was million compared to a net income from continuing operations in of million  or a decrease of million 
revenue in  our consolidated revenue amounted to million  an increase of million  or  approximately  a increase  when compared to s revenue of million 
this revenue increase was principally due to an increase in revenue recorded by our electronic security services and construction divisions of million and million  respectively 
revenue from electronic security services division increased by million to million in from million in revenue from the electronic security services division is comprised of the monitoring and maintenance of security systems at subscribers premises  billable services performed on a time and materials basis service revenue and net installation revenue after taking into effect the requirements of sab  which requires the deferral of certain revenue and related costs until services have been fulfilled 
the electronic security services division increase in revenue was primarily a result of the acquisition of the electronic security services operations of starpoint and coastal 
starpoint and coastal were acquired on february  and november   respectively 
these acquisitions were accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
the results of these operations are included in the financial statements only from the respective acquisition dates 

table of contents our construction division increased by million to million when compared to million in  or a increase 
this increase resulted primarily from increased activity in the bahamas and the us virgin islands 
our backlog of unfilled portions of construction contracts at december  was approximately million  involving projects  as compared to approximately million  involving projects  at december  from december  through march   we entered into new construction contracts in the caribbean  which revenue we anticipate when recognized will amount to approximately million 
the materials division continuing operations revenue decreased to million in compared to million in this was principally attributable to a decrease recorded by our combined operations on sint maarten st 
martin of  or million  a decrease recorded by our puerto rican operations of  or million  offset by or a million increase recorded by our antigua operation 
the decrease on sint maarten st 
martin was due to shortages of cement supply which were experienced in and have continued in and which have added to operational inefficiencies as well as declining sales 
during  management has implemented an alternative sourcing strategy for cement  which it believes should help in minimizing potential outages in the future 
given the current worldwide demand for cement and the pressures on supply  there can be no assurances that cement outages will not happen from time to time in the future 
the decline in puerto rico was due to a change of control transaction with respect to our largest customer and  as a consequence of this transaction we experienced a significant reduction in the volume of sand being purchased from us by this customer 
the increase in antigua was due to increased demand for aggregate and ready mix on the island due to an increase in local construction activity  as well as price increases which we implemented during the course of cost of electronic security services cost of electronic security services amounted to million or of revenue 
included in this cost are the direct costs incurred to monitor and service security systems installed at subscriber premises  as well as the net direct costs incurred with the installation of new security systems after taking into consideration the effects of sab these costs arose as a result of our aforementioned acquisitions of sec  starpoint and coastal 
cost of construction cost of construction as a percentage of construction revenue increased to during from during  or an increase of 
the increase is principally attributable to a substantial increase in the estimated costs to complete a marina project in the us virgin islands as a result of operational difficulties 
as a result of this project  the gross margin from construction operations was reduced by approximately million during the year 
the division also had overruns of approximately million on certain projects in the bahamas 
in addition  the construction division continued to experience declining margins due to the completion of high margin projects that are being replaced by lower margin projects 
we are closely monitoring our ongoing bidding  contracting and project management procedures with the objective of improving our gross margin on construction jobs in the future 
cost of materials cost of materials for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased to during from during continued delays and shortages in cement had a negative effect on our combined operation on sint maarten st 
martin as well as antigua 
the cement supply shortage experienced in continued in and  as a consequence  our ready mix plants were not able to produce finished products on many days throughout in addition we also experienced capacity problems in our ability to manufacture sand at our st 
martin quarry which resulted in the need for us to import more sand from third party producers  and higher raw material  shipping and production costs 
the imported sand has certain characteristics that require an increase in the volume of sand used in our ready mix operations to meet our quality control standards 
management has implemented an alternative sourcing strategy for cement  which it believes should help in minimizing potential outages in the future and has recently significantly curtailed selling our internally manufactured sand to third parties  which will provide higher quality  lower cost sand to our ready mix batch plant operations 
given the current worldwide demand for cement and the pressures on supply there can be no assurances that cement outages will not happen from time to time in the future 
in addition  our puerto rico operation incurred increased production costs due to higher equipment rental  fuel and maintenance expenses

the million increase in the construction division sg a expenses is primarily a result of increased travel expenses  wages and employee benefit costs associated with managing the larger number of projects and increased revenues generated by this division in  compared to severance and retirement expense severance and retirement expense decreased in to million from million 
the million decrease is due to the non recurring charges associated with the separation of our former chief financial officer and executive vice president 
impairment of assets in accordance with sfas  we performed an analysis of various construction contracts  quarry and material aggregate sites as well as our joint venture operations  devmat 
based on this review we determined that impairment of certain of our long lived assets had occurred and  accordingly  we recorded the following impairment charges materials operations  on the island of st

cost of materials cost of materials decreased to of materials revenue from in this decrease was primarily the result of improved margins in on operations of the island of st 
martin 
notwithstanding increased revenues in all our continuing materials operations  margins were impacted during due to tight supplies of cement throughout our operations 
this supply condition resulted in higher than expected raw materials cost at all our ready mix operations 
in addition  severe weather conditions brought on by several hurricanes which moved through the caribbean during september resulted in supply delays and other inefficiencies in our materials business during the fourth quarter of margins were also affected by unfavorable inventory variances recorded in the fourth quarter of

the increase in operating expense is principally the result of approximately million of bad debt expense and million of retirement and severance expense incurred by our sint maarten and antigua operations 
our corporate and unallocated operating expense increased million to million in compared to million in this increase is attributable to a million non cash expense associated with the issuance of certain common stock warrants  and a million increase in salaries and related benefits associated with adding the personnel necessary to execute our entry into the electronic security services sector  as well as to address the expected growth in our construction division 
in addition  we incurred an increase of million in legal and audit fees in other income other income increased million to million when compared to million in this increase was principally due to the settlement of an outstanding note receivable and various pending claims with the government of antigua and barbuda  which resulted in a gain of million 
during and  the government of antigua did not meet all of its payment obligations to us 
however  on december   antigua masonry products  limited and antigua heavy constructors  limited collectively amp  direct and indirect subsidiaries of ours  entered into an agreement for satisfaction of indebtedness and amendment no

john s dredging and deep water pier construction the satisfaction agreement with the government of antigua and barbuda antigua 
pursuant to the terms of the satisfaction agreement  amp and antigua agreed to a settlement in which approximately million in debt owed by antigua to those companies was deemed satisfied in exchange for certain cash payments made to those companies by antigua  as well as the remittance of all outstanding tax assessments and other relief from current and future taxes and duties 
we  at the time of settlement  had a recorded book value of approximately million for the notes 
as a result of this satisfaction agreement and in exchange for the cancellation of the outstanding debt owed to amp by antigua  amp received million in cash  a commitment for an additional  cash which was received during the first quarter of  a million credit toward future withholding taxes incurred by amp or us  plus remittance of all taxes and duties incurred through december  we have only recognized million of the future withholding and income tax benefit based on the current plans for repatriation of foreign earnings 
the satisfaction agreement also settled the litigation over a million assessment issued with respect to our subsidiaries in antigua 
income tax expense income tax expense increased by million in when compared to an amount less than million in critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is an analysis of the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  consistently applied 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies and estimates most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for credit losses  inventories and loss reserve for inventories  cost to complete construction contracts  assets held for sale  intangible assets  income taxes  taxes on un repatriated earnings  warranty obligations  impairment charges  restructuring  business divestitures  pensions  deferral compensation and other employee benefit plans or arrangements  environmental matters  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical 
table of contents experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue in the security division for repair and installation services  for which no monitoring contract is connected  is recognized when the services are performed 
revenue in the security division for monitoring services is recognized monthly as services are provided pursuant to the terms of subscriber contracts  which have prices that are fixed and determinable 
we assess the subscriber s ability to meet the contract terms  including meeting payment obligations  before entering into the contract 
nonrefundable installation charges and a portion of related direct costs to acquire the monitoring contract  such as sales commissions  are deferred and recognized over the estimated life of a new subscriber relationship which we have estimated at years 
if the site being monitored is disconnected prior the original expected life is completed  the unamortized portion of the deferred installation and direct costs to acquire are expensed 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs  for which collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue relating to claims only when there exists a legal basis supported by objective and verifiable evidence and additional identifiable costs are incurred due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control 
change orders for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that they will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
revenue for the materials division is recognized when the products are delivered fob destination  invoiced at a fixed price and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
we estimate costs to complete our construction contracts based on experience from similar work in the past 
if the conditions of the work to be performed change or if the estimated costs are not accurately projected  the gross profit from construction contracts may vary significantly in the future 
the foregoing  as well as weather  stage of completion and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
notes receivable are recorded at cost  less a related allowance for impaired notes receivable 
management  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers ability to repay their obligations  considers a note to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note s effective interest rate 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from management s review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
we consider the age of specific accounts  a customer s payment history 
for our construction and materials divisions  specific collateral given by the customer to secure the receivable is obtained when we determine necessary 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability arising from the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assessments about current and future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
if the actual market demand surpasses the projected levels  inventory write downs are not reserved 
we maintain an accrual for retirement agreements with our executives and certain other employees 
this accrual is based on the life expectancy of these persons and an assumed weighted average discount rate of 
should the actual longevity vary significantly from the united states insurance norms  or should the discount rate used to establish the present value of the obligation vary  the accrual may have to be significantly increased or diminished at that time 

table of contents based on a written legal opinion from antiguan counsel  we did not record a contingent liability of million  excluding any interest or penalties  for taxes assessed by the government of antigua and barbuda for the years through in december  we entered into an agreement with antigua settling certain obligations 
pursuant to this agreement  these assessments were deemed paid 
see note  foreign subsidiaries  to our consolidated financial statements 
the edc completed a compliance review on one of our subsidiaries in the us virgin islands on february  the compliance review covered the period from april  through march  and resulted from our application to request an extension of tax exemptions from the edc 
we are working with the edc to resolve the issues 
one of those issues is whether certain items of income qualified for exemption benefits under our then existing tax exemption  including notice of failure to make gross receipts tax payments of  and income taxes of million  not including interest and penalties 
this is the first time that a position contrary to our or any position on this specific issue has been raised by the edc 
in light of these recent events  and based on discussions with legal counsel  we established a tax accrual at december  for such exposure which approximates the amounts set forth in the edc notice 
in september and  the statute of limitations with respect to the income tax return filed by us for the year ended december  and  respectively  expired 
accordingly  in the third quarter of and  we reversed  and million respectively of the tax accrual established at december  we will work with the edc regarding this matter and if challenged by the us virgin islands taxing authority would vigorously contest its position 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination 
we determine for our construction and materials division our fixed assets recoverability on a subsidiary level or group of asset level 
if we  as a result of our valuation in the future  assess the assets not to be recoverable  a negative adjustment to the book value of those assets may occur 
on the other hand  if we impair an asset  and the asset continues to produce income  we may record earnings higher than they should have been if no impairment had been recorded 
we determine the lives of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
some of these assets  such as goodwill  we determine to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb this testing is based on subjective analysis and may change from time to time 
we tested goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on june  and will test for impairment annually each june other identifiable intangible assets with estimated useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
the review of impairment and estimation of useful life is subjective and may change from time to time 
customer accounts are stated at fair value based on the discounted cash flows over the estimated life of the customer contracts and relationships 
the company uses independent appraisal firms to perform a valuation study at the time of acquisition to determine the value and estimated life of customer accounts purchased in order to assist management in determining an appropriate method in which to amortize the asset 
the amortization life is based on historic analysis of customer relationships combined with estimates of expected future revenues from customer accounts 
the company amortizes customer accounts on a straight line basis over the expected life of the customer which varies from to years and records an additional charge equal to the remaining unamortized value of the customer account for accounts which discontinued service before the expected life 
the additional charge for discontinued accounts is equal to the remaining net book value of the customer contract and relationship for the specific customer account canceled 
we are not presently considering changes to any of our critical accounting policies and we do not presently believe that any of our critical accounting policies are reasonably likely to change in the near future 
there have not been any material changes to the methodology used in calculating our estimates during the last three years 
our ceo and cfo have reviewed all of the foregoing critical accounting policies and estimates 
new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory pricing amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the effective date for this standard is for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas 
table of contents no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb sfas no 
r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amends the compliance date  and we are required to adopt sfas r effective january  sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  except that entities also are allowed to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
we have determined we will use the modified prospective method 
we currently utilize black scholes  a standard option pricing model  to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we will continue to use the black scholes model to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 
sfas 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july  the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of sfas  asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that the conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas includes a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset in which the timing and or method of settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated  even if conditional on a future event 
the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
this statement defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
this statement also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in nondiscretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the effective date for this standard is for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the electronic security services business  monitoring services are typically billed in advance on either a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
installations of new security systems for residential customers typically result in a net investment in the customer  whereas installations of new security systems for commercial projects typically have neutral to positive cash flow 
in the construction business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
in the construction division  our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our construction services 
during and  we financed  and  respectively of construction contracts 
repayment by customers are due at different times within the next three years 
accounts receivable for the materials operation are typically established with terms between and days 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs 
we believe our cash flow from operations  existing working capital and funds available from lines of credit are adequate to meet our needs during the next months 
historically  we have used a number of lenders to finance a portion of our machinery and equipment purchases 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding to these lenders 
we believe we have significant collateral and financial stability so that we are able to obtain financing  should it be required  though no assurances can be made 
as of december   our liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and available lines of credit of million 
total outstanding liabilities were million as of december   compared to million a year earlier

on june   petit advised us in writing that petit was terminating the materials supply agreement immediately because petit had not received the full quarterly payment and also advised that it would not renew the lease when it expired on october  petit has refused to accept the remainder of the quarterly payment from us in the amount of  without prior notice to bbw  petit obtained orders to impound bbw assets on st

the assets sought to be impounded include bank accounts and receivables 
bbw has no assets on st

in obtaining the orders  petit alleged that million is due on the supply agreement the full payment that would be due by us if the contract continued for the entire potential term and we continued to mine the quarry  million is due for quarry restoration and million is due for pain and suffering 
the materials supply agreement provided that it could be terminated by us on july  in february  scgc  bbw and devcon entered into agreements with petit  which provided for the following the purchase by scgc of three hectares of partially mined land located within the quarry property previously leased from petit the three hectare parcel for approximately million  the purchase of which was settled in february  a two year lease of approximately hectares of land the hectare lease on which scgc operates a crusher  ready mix concrete plant and aggregates storage at a cost of  which arrangement was entered into february  the granting of an option to scgc to purchase two hectares of un mined property prior to december  for million  with million on december  and million payable on december   subject to the below terms in the event that scgc exercises this option  petit agrees to withdraw all legal actions against us and our subsidiaries 

table of contents in the event that scgc does not exercise the option to purchase and petit is subsequently awarded a judgment  scgc has the option to offset approximately million against the judgment amount and transfer ownership of the three hectare parcel purchased by scgc back to petit

after conferring with its french counsel and upon review by management  we believe that we have valid defenses and offsets to petit s claims  including  among others  those relating to our termination rights and the benefit to petit from us not mining the property 
based on the foregoing agreements and its review  management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

we are subject to certain federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
management believes that we are in compliance with all such laws and regulations except for certain violations of regulations governing the exploitation of our quarry in saint martin 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a statement of observations resulting from a site examination on september  the site examination was conducted by drire  the saint martin agency charged with the responsibility of enforcing regulations governing the exploitation of quarries 
we are in the process of addressing the items identified in the statement of observations  none of which are anticipated to have a material adverse effect upon us

our senior loan provided by cit issued in february was refinanced in november accordingly  with its repayment  a non recourse performance guarantee secured by our stock in dsh was released 
in connection with the cit senior loan repayment  and financing the acquisition of coastal security services in november  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with capitalsource finance llc replacing in full the cit facility 
the specific terms of the capitalsource revolving credit facility are more specifically described in the liquidity section of this management discussion and analysis 
we have signed a non recourse performance guarantee with capitalsource and pledged  as collateral  our stock in dsh 
subsequently  in connection with the march acquisition of guardian  we increased the facility with capitalsource to million 
we have no other off balance sheet transactions where we are the obligors 
details regarding our s other contingent liabilities are described fully in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates  which it we manage primarily by managing the maturities of our financial instruments 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our financial instruments 
a change in interest rate may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates results from the variable rate of our senior secured revolving credit facility with capitalsource  as an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the interest rate on our senior secured revolving credit facility is payable at variable rates indexed to either libor or the base rate 
the effect of each increase in the libor rate and the base rate on our senior secured revolving credit facility would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately million 
based on the us yield curve as of december  and other available information  we project interest expense on our variable rate debt to increase approximately   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively we have operations overseas 
generally  all significant activities of the overseas affiliates are recorded in their functional currency  which is generally the currency of the country of domicile of the affiliate 
the foreign functional currencies that we deal with are netherlands antilles guilders  eastern caribbean units and euros 
the first two are pegged to the us dollar and have remained fixed for many years 
management does not believe a change in the euro exchange rate will materially affect our financial position or results of operations
