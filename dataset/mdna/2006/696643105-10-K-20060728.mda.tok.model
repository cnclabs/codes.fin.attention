critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in palm s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  these estimates and judgments are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheets and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for rebates  price protection  product returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty and technical service costs  royalty obligations  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  restructurings  inventory and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  including staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  as amended  and aicpa statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenues from sales of mobile computing devices under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title to the customer  net of estimated returns  provided the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
for one of our web sales distributors  we recognize revenue based on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distributor 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  revenue is reduced for our 
table of contents estimates of liability related to these rights at the time the related sale is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the channel and other related factors 
the estimates and reserves for rebates and price protection are based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue from software arrangements with end users of our devices is recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
deferred revenue is recorded for post contract support and any other future deliverables  and is recognized over the support period or as the elements of the agreement are delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements contained in software arrangements is based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately  but is expected to be sold in the marketplace within six months of the initial determination of the price by management 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international  political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a change in a major customer s creditworthiness or actual defaults differ from our historical experience  our actual results could differ from our estimates of recoverability 
we accrue for warranty costs based on historical rates of repair as a percentage of shipment levels and the expected repair cost per unit  service policies and our experience with products in production or distribution 
if we experience claims or significant changes in costs of services  such as third party vendor charges  materials or freight  which could be higher or lower than our historical experience  our cost of revenues could differ from our estimates 
palm accrues for royalty obligations to other technology and patent holders based on unit shipments of its smartphone and handheld computing devices  as a percentage of applicable revenue for the net sales of products using certain software technologies or as a fully paid up license fee  all as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreements 
where agreements are not finalized  accrued royalty obligations represent management s current best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections based on negotiations with third party licensors 
palm has accrued royalty obligations of million and million as of may  and  respectively  including estimated royalties of million and million  respectively  which are reported in other accrued liabilities 
fiscal year includes a benefit of approximately million as a result of negotiating more favorable licensing terms than were expected as of may  while the amounts ultimately agreed upon may be more or less than the current accrual  management does not believe that finalization of the agreements would have had a material impact on the amounts reported for its financial position as of may  or for the reported results for the year then ended  however  the effect of finalization in the future may be significant to the period in which recorded 
long lived assets such as land held for sale  and property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test at the reporting unit level within our single reporting segment 
a goodwill impairment loss would be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized for an intangible asset to the extent that the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is determined based upon the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition 
cash flow estimates used in evaluating for impairment represent management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 

table of contents effective for calendar year  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal activity 
prior to calendar year  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we accrued for restructuring costs when we made a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identified all significant actions to be taken 
we record initial restructuring charges based on assumptions and related estimates that we deem appropriate for the economic environment at the time these estimates are made 
we reassess restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities  and we record new restructuring accruals as liabilities are incurred 
inventory purchases and purchase commitments are based upon forecasts of future demand 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
if we believe that demand no longer allows us to sell our inventory above cost or at all  then we write down that inventory to market or write off excess inventory levels 
if customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts  requirements for inventory write offs could differ from our estimates 
our deferred tax assets represent the tax effects of net operating loss nol carryforwards  of tax credit carryforwards and of temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years if we have taxable income 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  based on estimates and certain tax planning strategies 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance based upon current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future years 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional provision benefit to income tax expense 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company determined  based on current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future periods  that it is more likely than not that its domestic deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and  accordingly  that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
in reaching this conclusion  the company weighed both negative and positive evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets and considered the extent to which the evidence could be objectively verified 
the primary factors considered by the company during the second quarter of fiscal year were that the company had cumulative profits before income taxes of million for the three year period ended with the second quarter of fiscal year  excluding the effects in fiscal year of discontinued operations and the write down of the land held for sale 
since the company spun off palmsource and acquired handspring in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company was profitable in eight of nine quarters and had experienced cumulative profits before income taxes of million 
in addition  the company also considered the following factors based upon the company s recent results of operations  as well as its internal projections  the company expects to utilize its nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration over approximately the next years 
the company has never had any expired operating loss carryovers in its history  and after utilization of net operating losses against the fiscal year federal taxable income  the first federal nol carryforward scheduled to expire is in the year 
table of contents although the company operates in an industry which is competitive and experiences rapid technological change  we have operated successfully in this environment 
during the previous eight quarters  we have expanded our product mix from solely handheld computing devices to include smartphones  which now comprise a majority of our revenues 
we have maintained profitability and achieved year over year revenue growth during this period 
the smartphone market is expected to continue to expand in the future and we expect to experience revenue and profit growth 
as a result  during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company released approximately million of valuation allowance of which million relating to previously exercised stock options was credited directly to additional paid in capital  million relating to net operating losses of handspring prior to its acquisition was credited to goodwill and million was recorded as a non cash income tax benefit resulting in an increase in earnings 
although the company has determined that a valuation allowance is no longer required with respect to its domestic net operating loss carryforwards  deferred expenses and tax credit carryforwards  recovery is dependent on achieving the forecast of future operating income over a protracted period of time 
as of may   the company would require approximately billion in cumulative future operating income to be generated at various times over approximately the next years to realize the net deferred tax assets 
based upon the company s results for the most recent fiscal years  it would take the company less than years to utilize its current nol and tax credit carryforwards 
through the end of fiscal year  the company has experienced ten consecutive quarters of double digit year over year revenue growth 
during this period the company s profits have also grown  which  if projected into the future  would result in utilization of current nol and tax credit carryforwards in an even shorter number of years 
the company will review its forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
the trends include the expected continued growth of the smartphone market 
failure by the company to achieve its future operating income targets or negative changes to expected trends may change the assessment regarding the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods 
our key critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended may  and revenues years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands revenues we derive our revenues from sales of our smartphone and handheld computing devices  add ons and accessories 
revenues for fiscal year increased approximately from fiscal year smartphone revenue was billion for fiscal year and increased from million for fiscal year handheld revenue was million for fiscal year and decreased from million for fiscal year during fiscal year  net device units shipped were approximately  units at an average selling price of per unit 
during fiscal year  net device units shipped were approximately  units at an average selling price of per unit 
of this increase in revenues  the increase in average selling prices contributed approximately percentage points and the increase in net unit shipments contributed approximately percentage points 
the increase in average selling price reflects a continued shift towards smartphones during fiscal year smartphones carry a higher average selling price than handheld computing devices 
the increase in net unit shipments is due to a higher volume of smartphone unit sales primarily in the united states to our carrier partners  partially offset by a decrease in handheld unit sales 
international revenues were approximately of worldwide revenues in fiscal year  compared with approximately in fiscal year of the increase in worldwide revenues from fiscal year  approximately percentage points resulted from an increase in united states revenues  partially offset by approximately a percentage point decrease in international revenues

table of contents depreciation  and allocated information technology and facilities costs 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the decrease is primarily the result of approximately percentage points of lower product costs due to a benefit of royalty obligations as a result of negotiating more favorable rates on certain radio technologies and a shift in our product mix towards smartphones which constituted of our revenues during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year in addition  we experienced reduced manufacturing division spending rates during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  contributing approximately percentage points  as a result of reduced depreciation costs as older equipment has become fully depreciated 
freight costs decreased by approximately percentage points primarily due to a reduction in expedited shipments to customers 
in addition  excess and obsolete inventory costs decreased by percentage point due to a reduction in our provision for end of life products in the current year as compared to the comparable period a year ago 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in warranty expenses of percentage points due to a shift in our product mix towards smartphones  which carry higher warranty costs than handheld computing devices as a percentage of their respective revenues 
in addition  the increase in warranty expenses was impacted by an increase in our estimates of return rates of our earlier model smartphone and higher per unit repair costs

table of contents sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   which is palm s fiscal year we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
we will recognize in our results of operations the compensation cost for stock based awards issued after may  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for stock based awards issued prior to june   we will amortize the related compensation costs using the graded vesting method 
management currently estimates a charge to earnings before income taxes between million to million in fiscal year as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we anticipate that we will grant additional options  restricted stock and performance shares  also known as restricted stock units  in fiscal year the fair value of these grants cannot be predicted with certainty at this time because the expense amount will depend on the timing of new grants  the number of new grants and changes in the market price or the volatility of our common stock 
in fiscal year  the contractual life of our stock options will be shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or after this date  and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees exercise behavior  it may change the expected term of an option going forward 
sfas no 
r will require us to include estimated forfeitures 
therefore  the required adoption of sfas no 
r could have a material impact on the timing of stock based compensation expense and  based on the accuracy of estimates of future actual forfeiters  the amount of stock based compensation expense 
any changes in these assumptions may significantly impact the stock based compensation expenses for the future

we utilize contract manufacturers to build our products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build products based on demand forecast information supplied by palm  which typically covers a rolling month period 
consistent with industry practice  we acquire inventories from such manufacturers through blanket purchase orders against which orders are applied based on projected demand information and availability of goods 
such purchase commitments typically cover our forecasted product and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and or adjust our requirements based on our business needs 
consequently  only a portion of our purchase commitments arising from these agreements may be non cancelable and unconditional commitments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we currently maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of cash equivalents and short term investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the objectives of our investment activities are to maintain the safety of principal  assure sufficient liquidity and achieve appropriate returns 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities and by limiting exposure to any one issuance or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial investments in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents are primarily money market funds and an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may  would 
table of contents cause an immaterial decline in the fair value of our cash equivalents 
as of may   we had short term investments of million 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months  and of marketable equity securities 
these available for sale investments  consisting primarily of auction rate securities  including government  domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and marketable equity securities  are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may  would cause a decline of less than  or million  in the fair market value of our short term investment portfolio 
we would expect our operating results or cash flows to be similarly affected by such a change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we denominate our sales to certain international customers in the euro  in pounds sterling  in brazilian real and in swiss francs 
expenses and other transactions are also incurred in a variety of currencies 
we hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates by using foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains and losses on the contracts are intended to offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within days 
we do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
movements in currency exchange rates could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or interest and other income expense 
equity price risk as of may  we do not own any material equity investments 
therefore  we do not currently have any material direct equity price risk
