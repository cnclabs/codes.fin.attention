retail operations consist of franchised and company operated midas shops in north america and licensed midas shops in other countries 
supply chain activities include providing value added merchandising services to franchisees in which the company establishes relationships with vendors who distribute products and equipment directly to midas shops 
real estate activities include the development  ownership and leasing of midas shops in north america 
midas retail locations have historically operated as under car specialists focused on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  and shocks and struts 
as recently as  exhaust and brake repair services constituted of midas retail shop revenues in the us market 
as automobile manufacturers began to employ non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems in the mid s  the average life of an original equipment exhaust system began to increase from three years to over years 
as a result  beginning in the mid s  midas core exhaust replacement business began to experience sustained revenue declines 
this trend  combined with the increased technological complexity and durability of newer vehicles  has changed the nature of automotive repairs 
today  the services performed over the lifetime of a vehicle are more likely to be maintenance services and light repair work 
in response to these trends  the company began to broaden its service menu in  with the purpose of transforming itself from an under car specialist to a full service automotive repair and maintenance provider  leveraging midas strong brand name and nationwide presence 

table of contents in addition to managing the global midas retail system  the company historically distributed brake  shock  strut and other automotive parts to its dealers in north america through a network of automotive parts warehouses 
midas also manufactured and distributed exhaust products and equipment to midas dealers and independent exhaust distributors 
however  the dramatic decline in the retail exhaust business coupled with the broadening services menu and the emergence of quick delivery parts suppliers caused retail auto service providers  including midas dealers  to gradually reduce their investments in parts inventories within their shops  preferring to source required auto parts only at the time the part was needed for a specific customer 
as a result of these trends  the company s revenue from the wholesale distribution of parts declined and midas wholesale distribution and exhaust manufacturing operations became unprofitable 
in fiscal  midas management redirected the company s strategic focus towards the core midas retail operations 
during that year  the company shut down its network of parts distribution warehouses and outsourced parts distribution on behalf of midas dealers in the us and canada 
in fiscal  the company ceased production at its hartford  wisconsin exhaust manufacturing facility and began the process of liquidating all assets related to its exhaust manufacturing and distribution operation 
currently  midas is in the process of executing the final shutdown of its exhaust warehouse in chicago  illinois  which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal with the company s exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution nearly complete  midas is now solely focused on the profitable growth of the midas retail system 
management is committed to leveraging the strong midas brand and the broad geographic presence of the midas system towards establishing midas as the pre eminent full service automotive repair and maintenance network 
the midas business transformation during fiscal  midas developed and began to implement a plan to dramatically restructure the company s operations and re direct the company s strategic focus towards the midas retail system 
this plan is intended to transform the company by improving profitability  enhancing the competitive position of the midas retail system  strengthening the company s balance sheet and reducing future capital requirements 
this transformation encompasses fundamental changes in the way midas dealers are supplied with midas brand products and other replacement auto parts  a re definition of the service relationship between midas dealers and their customers  and a shift in the way the company approaches its relationship with midas franchisees 
certain aspects of the transformation were completed in fiscal while others continued into fiscal and during  the company outsourced the wholesale distribution of midas brand products and other replacement parts  closed all but one of the company s regional distribution centers  disposed of its pwi quick delivery distribution locations through sale or closure  closed or re franchised company operated shops  and significantly reduced corporate administrative overhead 
in connection with the company s ongoing transformation  management determined that exhaust manufacturing and distribution no longer represented a strategic fit for the company s evolving retail focused business model  and in october announced its intention to sell its ipc exhaust distribution business and exit exhaust manufacturing 
in may  the company entered into an agreement appointing autozone  inc as the exclusively endorsed supplier of arvin brand exhaust products to midas shops in the us midas also entered into an agreement with arvinmeritor to sell certain ipc branded exhaust assets 
in december  the company announced a similar exhaust supply agreement in canada with uni select  establishing it as the exclusively endorsed supplier of walker brand exhaust products to midas shops in canada 
as a result of these agreements  midas ceased production at its hartford  wisconsin exhaust manufacturing plant during the third quarter of fiscal midas continues to operate its exhaust distribution warehouse in chicago  illinois in order to provide midas brand exhaust products to midas dealers in canada prior to their ultimate conversion to their new exhaust supply programs 
it is expected that all remaining exhaust inventory and equipment will be sold and liquidated in the first quarter of and that the facility will be closed by march  
table of contents when completed  the company expects that midas exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution will have the effect of further reducing overall company revenues and expenses compared to current and historical levels  and will increase the company s operating margin 
however  the company expects to generate operating losses in its exhaust distribution operation prior to its final shut down during early in connection with the above described business transformation activities  the company recorded business transformation charges of million during the past four fiscal years  including million in fiscal the midas business transformation  and the resulting changes to the way the company does business  will continue through fiscal and beyond 
the ultimate objective of the midas business transformation was established in and is reflected in midas vision of midas management is working towards achieving increase in midas shop sales on a same store basis 
three core services brakes  exhaust and maintenance 
doubling of midas dealer profits 
one midas the company and midas dealers working together as one in support of the retail system 
with these goals in mind  midas management is committed to the company s mission of becoming the most trusted professional and first choice for customers auto service needs 
the specific components of the midas business transformation and how the company intends to move forward are discussed in greater detail below 
retail transformation the midas system of retail service shops has historically operated as an under car specialist focused primarily on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  shocks and struts 
consequently  much of the work performed by midas shops represented one time repair transactions 
however  improvements in the quality of original equipment parts and the technological complexity of automobiles over the past decade have changed the nature of automotive repair 
the services performed over the lifetime of today s vehicles are more likely to be scheduled maintenance services and light repair work 
the company s initial response to these trends was to promote the expansion of services offered by midas dealers 
this program was known as the new midas and was launched in fiscal while the midas retail system has made substantial progress in broadening its services  it has not yet been widely successful in developing ongoing service relationships with its customers 
going forward  midas is focused on becoming less dependent upon one time repair transactions and more focused on building long term customer relationships 
the company is transforming itself from a repair business that offers maintenance service  into a maintenance business that performs repairs 
to this end  the company has re defined the core services of the midas system to now encompass exhaust  brakes and maintenance 
in fiscal  midas successfully launched a major retail initiative to significantly expand midas shop sales of tires and related tire services 
during fiscal  the company rolled out a series of initiatives designed to enhance the midas system s ability to build revenue from retail maintenance services 
these initiatives included the standardization of the midas oil change service and vehicle inspection process  providing all customers with factory maintenance schedules and increasing the midas shop s focus and capabilities in fluid exchange services 
in addition  the company is rolling out a national customer relationship management program in which dealers utilize targeted promotional mailings to increase shop visit frequency among existing customers and more efficiently establish relationships with new customers 
finally  the company is developing a comprehensive program targeting the fleet vehicle maintenance market segment 
this program is designed to leverage the national scope of the midas system and equip dealers with the necessary tools to build sustainable fleet service revenues 

table of contents in connection with midas ongoing retail transformation  the company recently developed a major update to the company s shop image 
the new image program incorporates changes to internal shop appearance and merchandising  as well as a significant redesign of the midas shop fa ade 
midas management believes the new image will better showcase the company s expansion into new services  enhance efforts to educate customers and significantly increase the visibility and curb appeal of the typical midas shop 
the company expects a majority of midas shops throughout north america to adopt the new shop image 
in order to encourage midas dealers to adopt this new image during and  the company is offering to provide a subsidy of approximately  per shop 
as a result  midas management expects that the implementation of this program will result in additional business transformation costs each quarter during fiscal and midas believes the total charges will be less than million 
the initial results from this retail transformation have been encouraging 
the company has achieved positive comparable shop sales in the us for eleven consecutive quarters 
comparable shop sales in canada increased during the most recent three consecutive quarters  which was the first consecutive three quarter increase since in addition  total overall midas system revenues in the us grew in both and after declining each year from to the company believes that  with its sharpened focus on retail execution within the midas system  it can accelerate the positive sales trends going forward and begin to grow the overall midas system shop count 
supply chain transformation historically  the company supported the midas franchise network with manufacturing of certain exhaust products and distribution of midas brand products and other replacement auto parts on a weekly basis to its retail shops in north america 
the company distributed these products through a network of regional wholesale parts distribution centers 
additionally  as dealers began to source more product on a just in time basis  the company supported numerous midas dealers through its network of pwi quick delivery locations 
together  these two wholesale operations provided a significant portion of the typical midas dealer s ongoing parts sourcing needs 
however  the combined wholesale operation generated operating losses  driven by eroding sales of traditional wholesale products  especially exhaust  and start up losses associated with newer pwi locations 
furthermore  as of the end of fiscal  the company still needed to build an additional to pwi locations to adequately cover midas dealers across north america 
in response to the operating losses and significant capital requirements of these wholesale operations  midas determined that continuing to support the traditional midas wholesale distribution operation and the growth of the pwi network was no longer financially viable  and that the parts sourcing needs of midas shops could be better served by outsourcing the distribution of midas brand parts in the us and canada 
thus  during fiscal  midas closed its traditional midas wholesale parts distribution and pwi quick delivery operations and appointed autozone  inc and uni select inc 
as the exclusive distributors of midas brand products in the us and canada  respectively 
the company s agreements with autozone and uni select provide for the weekly distribution of replacement parts to midas retail shops  consistent with the service previously provided by the company s traditional wholesale operation 
the company believes these agreements enable midas dealers to purchase both midas brand product and other replacement auto parts at favorable pricing  and provide dealers with access to just in time parts delivery through a broad network of quick delivery parts distribution sites across north america 
under its agreements with autozone and uni select  the company receives royalties on the sale of all products sold by autozone and uni select to midas dealers throughout north america 
these royalties are intended to offset the cash expenses associated with the lifetime warranty issued on certain products 
since the initial outsourcing of weekly parts distribution to midas shops  the company also has established preferred supply agreements with the national automotive parts association napa and carquest corporation 
these additional automotive parts supply relationships were established primarily to expand the geographic scope of just in time parts delivery options available to midas dealers throughout the us midas receives royalties on the sale of all products sold by autozone  napa and carquest to midas dealers in the us and all products sold by uni select to midas dealers in canada 
the royalties are recorded as revenue with no offsetting cost of goods sold 

table of contents in fiscal  the company sold its ipc exhaust distribution business and exited exhaust manufacturing 
midas believes that exhaust manufacturing no longer represents a strategic fit for the company s evolving retail focused business model 
midas believes that exiting exhaust manufacturing will best enable the company to ensure that midas franchisees have access to competitively priced  high quality exhaust products going forward and allow the company to continue providing the long standing midas lifetime warranty on mufflers 
in may  the company entered into an agreement appointing autozone as the exclusively endorsed supplier of arvin brand exhaust products to midas shops in the us as a result of this agreement  exhaust products in the us are now supplied to autozone by the light vehicle aftermarket division of arvinmeritor and have replaced midas brand products that were manufactured by midas and sold to midas shops by autozone 
in addition  under a separate agreement  arvinmeritor agreed to purchase certain ipc brand exhaust assets from midas 
the conversion of midas dealers in the us from midas brand exhaust products to arvin brand exhaust products was completed prior to the close of fiscal in december  the company announced a similar exhaust supply agreement in canada with uni select  establishing them as the exclusively endorsed supplier of walker brand exhaust products to midas shops in canada 
as a result of this agreement  exhaust products in canada are now supplied to uni select by the walker exhaust division of tenneco automotive and are replacing midas brand products that were manufactured by midas and sold to midas shops in canada by uni select 
the company expects to complete this exhaust transition in canada by the end of the first quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of  midas ceased production at its hartford  wisconsin exhaust manufacturing facility 
however  midas continues to operate its exhaust distribution warehouse in chicago  illinois in order to provide midas brand exhaust products to midas dealers in canada prior to their ultimate conversion to their new exhaust supply programs 
the company is in the process of liquidating all assets related to the manufacturing and distribution of exhaust and expects to close its chicago exhaust distribution facility by the end of the first quarter of fiscal through this transformation of the midas supply chain  the company has eliminated operating losses and working capital requirements associated with its former exhaust manufacturing and wholesale parts distribution operations 
in the new business model  the company is focused on working cooperatively with franchisees to ensure access to high quality parts at favorable prices  while generating product royalties that require little working capital investment and support the financial health of the midas lifetime warranty program 
corporate transformation with the outsourcing of the company s wholesale distribution and pwi operations during fiscal  and the company s more recent exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution  midas corporate direction is focused on the midas retail system 
now and in the future  all of the company s operations and activities are assessed based on their contribution to the overall corporate goal of building a successful retail system in north america and the world 
as part of the company s restructuring activities  all corporate positions have been evaluated 
consistent with the company s new strategic focus  there has been a significant reduction in the total number of employees across all operations  from approximately  employees at the close of fiscal to approximately employees at the end of fiscal in addition to the decrease in the total number of employees  the nature of the work performed has changed  as existing roles have been re defined 
for example  whereas before this transformation process began  the company s franchise system district managers were engaged in monitoring compliance with various wholesale initiatives  today their roles are focused on assisting midas franchisees and coordinating the rollout of key retail initiatives that enhance the profitable growth of the midas system 
in addition  the midas franchise development function has been re constituted with additional staff and resources 
since the mid s  this function had not been a focus of the company 
going forward  midas management is focused on re establishing the company s capacity to organically grow the midas franchise system throughout north america and the world 

table of contents this corporate transformation continues to evolve based on the needs of the retail system 
midas continues to take the steps necessary to eliminate excess administrative expense and focus all management efforts on the new corporate direction 
midas management has committed to reducing selling  general and administrative expense before changes in company operated shop count by million over the next three years  including an expected million reduction in financial transformation as of the end of fiscal  midas was a highly leveraged company with substantial investments in fixed assets and working capital 
midas wholesale distribution operations  including the traditional midas wholesale operation and the pwi network  were both generating operating losses 
the combined wholesale distribution operation had over million in merchandise inventory  and the company held more than million in accounts receivable generated by wholesale activity 
furthermore  the company maintained its investment in regional distribution centers and pwi locations with ongoing capital expenditures 
facing continuing losses in the wholesale operations  midas determined that continuing to support the traditional midas wholesale distribution operation and pwi network was no longer financially viable  and that the parts sourcing needs of midas system dealers could be better served by outsourcing the distribution of midas brand products and other replacement parts in the us and canada 
as a result  during fiscal midas closed all but one of its regional distribution centers  disposed of all of its pwi locations through sale or closure and liquidated the related wholesale inventory and accounts receivable 
in fiscal  the company exited exhaust manufacturing and is currently in the process of closing its exhaust distribution warehouse and liquidating all remaining assets related to exhaust manufacturing and distribution 
the liquidation of fixed assets  inventory and accounts receivable from the company s former wholesale distribution and manufacturing operations  as well as the significant improvement in the company s operating performance  has enabled midas to reduce total debt by approximately million since december as a result  midas was able to refinance its credit facilities in march and again in october at much more favorable terms 
prior to  midas credit facilities were secured by substantially all of the company s assets  contained restrictive covenants  substantially limited or disallowed stock repurchases  dividend payments and capital investments  and required mandatory principal repayments 
the new midas credit facility is unsecured  allows for stock repurchases and dividends based on operating cash flow performance  and has no mandatory principal repayment schedule 
total midas sales and revenues will decline in fiscal as a result of the exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution 
however  midas management believes the exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution will be accretive to earnings and free cash flow  while further reducing the company s investment in fixed assets and working capital 
management believes this new business model is capable of generating substantial free cash flow from operations with relatively low working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
the company intends to utilize some of this free cash flow to grow the midas retail system 
however  midas management also believes that a portion of this free cash flow can be used to repurchase shares of the company s stock 
in november  the company announced that the board of directors had authorized a share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to million in midas stock 
during fiscal  the company repurchased million in stock as part of this plan 
in the future  the company intends to continue to repurchase shares from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  depending upon market and business conditions

the company is seeking ways to leverage the value of the global midas brand through development of additional licensee relationships throughout the world 
fiscal reporting periods fiscal years and were each comprised of weeks  while fiscal was comprised of weeks 

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal total company sales and revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal to million 
within the retail auto service business  royalty revenues and license fees increased million  or  from this year over year increase was driven by a million increase in canadian royalties and license fees primarily due to revenue recognized from delinquent franchisees and a more favorable exchange rate  a comparable shop increase in system wide midas retail sales and higher international royalties  partially offset by a year over year decline in total shop count 
sales from company operated shops increased million  or  above fiscal the sales increase primarily reflects an increase in comparable shop sales of approximately  which was partially offset by a net reduction of the number of shops in operation during the year compared to fiscal revenues from real estate leases decreased slightly to million 
the decrease primarily reflects a net reduction in shops subject to real estate rental agreements relative to fiscal  partially offset by rent increases and a more favorable exchange rate on canadian rental income 
replacement part sales and product royalties decreased million to million from million in fiscal product royalties reflect royalties earned on the sale of parts to midas dealers by autozone  napa and carquest in the us and uni select in canada 
the decrease primarily reflects a million decrease in revenues from exhaust manufacturing and distribution as a result of the company s exit from exhaust distribution in the us during the second half of in addition  product royalty revenues declined as a result of midas agreement to lower uni select s royalty to match canadian warranty claims 
these declines were partially offset by a million increase in sales of products such as tires and batteries to midas dealers through the company s alliances with supply chain partners including bridgestone firestone and interstate battery 
during both fiscal and  replacement part revenues were comprised of the distribution of exhaust products to autozone  inc in the us  uni select inc in canada and to certain independent exhaust distributors  as well as sales derived from the company s coordination and administration of certain merchandise programs on behalf of midas dealers  including tires  batteries  shop equipment and bulk oil 
the company s gross profit margin  including business transformation charges of million  decreased to in fiscal excluding business transformation charges in both and  the gross profit margin was for fiscal up from in fiscal the company s gross margin benefited from a more favorable sales mix during fiscal  in which a higher percentage of revenues came from franchise royalties and company operated shops  and a lower percentage of revenues were derived from lower margin wholesale sales primarily exhaust and bridgestone firestone tires 
the company resells bridgestone firestone tires to midas dealers at a small mark up that is primarily intended to cover the cost of administering the merchandise program 
in addition  warranty expense declined million to million or of total sales for fiscal compared to million or of total sales in fiscal the decline in warranty expense is the result of the company s vendors assuming responsibility for the warranty on certain products  lower retail sales of brakes and exhaust  as well as a reduction in the warranty redemption and reimbursement rates for brakes 
the positive impact of a more favorable sales mix and lower warranty expense more than offset the negative margin impact of reduced gross margins in company operated shops and lower margins from the liquidation of exhaust inventory 
during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement appointing autozone as the exclusively endorsed supplier of arvin brand exhaust products to midas shops in the us in december  the company announced a similar exhaust supply agreement in canada with uni select  establishing them as the exclusively endorsed supplier of walker brand exhaust products to midas shops in canada 
in addition  during the year midas entered into an agreement with arvinmeritor to sell certain ipc branded exhaust assets 
as a result of these agreements  midas ceased production at its exhaust manufacturing facility in the third quarter of fiscal and expects to close its exhaust distribution operation in chicago  illinois in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with midas exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution  the company recorded inventory related charges of million primarily to reduce its exhaust inventory  including raw materials  to its expected net realizable value 
this write down was recorded as a cost of sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million  or  from fiscal to million 
the slight decrease in expenses primarily reflects lower costs incurred in the distribution of exhaust and lower expenses for company operated shops as a result fewer shops and improved control over shop payroll expense 
these savings were partially offset by the loss of sublease rental income on excess space at the company s corporate headquarters facility  higher operating costs in connection with the ongoing rollout to midas dealers of certain retail initiatives and higher bad debt expense 
during  the company recorded charges of million as part of selling  general and administrative expense related to the company s ongoing business transformation process 
these charges included million for severance for exhaust manufacturing and distribution employees  million to reflect the impairment and abandonment of exhaust related fixed assets  million to reflect a lower expected collection rate on receivables related to the exhaust business  million of charges pertaining to the wind down of warehouse operations  million related to the wind up of an hourly pension plan in canada  and million in other restructuring costs 
as a result of the above changes  operating income decreased million to operating income of million in from operating income of million in excluding the impact of the above described business transformation charges of million  operating income for fiscal was million compared to million for excluding the impact of business transformation charges  operating income margin increased to in from in interest expense decreased from million in to million in as a result of lower interest rates on the company s debt and a lower average total debt level than the prior year 
the company refinanced its debt in october resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the write off of unamortized financing fees  which was partially offset by the recognition of gains related to the company s interest rate hedge 
during  the company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million to reflect a write off of the unamortized discount and financing fees related to a prior debt agreement 
during  the company recorded a gain on sale of million to reflect the sale of the company s huth exhaust equipment manufacturing operation and million to reflect the partial recognition of the gain from the march sale and leaseback of the company s chicago distribution facility 
the remainder of the total million gain from the sale of the chicago distribution center will be recognized over the term of the leaseback agreement  which ends in april in addition  the company recorded a loss on disposition of exhaust manufacturing equipment assets of million 
these transactions resulted in a net gain on sale of assets of million for fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded a gain on sale of million in connection with the sale of a distribution facility in december the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to negative in fiscal the current year effective tax rate reflects a reduction from the company s statutory tax rate of as a result of the reversal of a tax contingency established in connection with prior asset sales 
as a result of the above items  net income decreased million from net income of million in to net income of million in results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales and revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal to million  reflecting the impact of the company s business transformation activities that were initiated during fiscal within the retail auto service business  royalty revenues and license fees increased from due to an increase in royalties from international licensees  a comparable shop increase in system wide midas retail sales in north america and the positive sales impact of the company s re franchising of company operated shops during fiscal  whose royalties were previously not included in franchising revenues 
these 
table of contents increases were partially offset by a reduction in north american shop count and lower franchise fee revenue compared to the prior year  when re franchising of company operated shops increased franchise fee revenue 
sales from company operated shops declined million  or a decrease of from fiscal the entire sales decrease reflects a reduction in the average number of company operated shops in operation during compared to the prior year as comparable shop sales increased in revenues from real estate rentals increased slightly to million 
the increase primarily reflects scheduled rent increases and the re franchising of previously company operated shops during fiscal  which offset a decrease in the number of shops in operation 
replacement part sales and product royalties decreased million to million from million in fiscal the decrease reflects the company s exit from the traditional wholesale and pwi parts distribution businesses during fiscal fiscal revenues are comprised primarily of the sale of exhaust products  sales of tires  oil and batteries that are shipped directly to shops by the manufacturers but billed through midas  and product royalties 
during fiscal  product royalties earned on the sale of parts to midas dealers by autozone and uni select increased more than three fold over the prior year when the transition to the autozone and uni select outsourced distribution arrangements had only just begun 
sales of tires  oil and batteries increased in  consistent with the company s expansion into maintenance services at the retail shop level 
exhaust sales declined in fiscal  consistent with the long term trend 
however  comparison of exhaust sales between and are not meaningful due to the distribution outsourcing 
gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to a gross profit margin of in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded charges to gross profit of million to establish a reserve for estimated future claims related to its lifetime warranty of exhaust and brake products in the us and canada  and to write down the value of inventory associated with the company s exit from the traditional wholesale parts distribution business 
in fiscal  the company recorded an additional million inventory write down in association with the company s exit from the traditional wholesale parts distribution operation 
excluding these charges to gross profit  the company s gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a shift in the mix of the company s revenues towards a greater share of sales derived from higher margin franchising and company operated shop operations 
the favorable shift in sales mix helped to offset significantly lower gross margins generated on the sale of exhaust parts in connection with the company s outsourcing of exhaust distribution to autozone and uni select  compared to the gross margins the company realized in fiscal when selling exhaust and other auto parts directly to midas franchisees 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million  or  from million in to million 
the large decrease in expenses reflects the closure of pwi and all but one of the company s regional distribution centers during fiscal  as well as lower operating expenses associated with a reduced number of company operated shops compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company incurred approximately million in expenses related to compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act

these charges are described in greater detail in note of notes to financial statements 
as a result of the above changes  operating income increased million from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in these changes caused an increase in operating income margin to in fiscal from a negative in excluding the impact of the above described business transformation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal representing charges to gross profit and selling  general and administrative expense  operating income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal

in fiscal  the company recorded million in charges related to the early extinguishment of a prior debt agreement 
in fiscal  the company recorded a gain on sale of million in connection with the sale of a distribution facility in december the company s effective tax rate was a negative in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to state tax refunds and the reversal of a reserve for certain european withholding taxes due to the favorable resolution of the matter 
as a result of the above items  net income improved million from a loss of million in fiscal to income of million in fiscal liquidity  financial condition and capital resources following is a summary of the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal and  respectively in millions fiscal year cash provided by operating activities before cash outlays for business transformation costs and total changes in assets and liabilities cash outlays for business transformation costs total changes in assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the company s cash management system permits the company to make daily borrowings and repayments on its line of credit

such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  and the company s existing business transformation process  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from midas on certain midas products purchased from midas shops in north america  namely brake friction  mufflers  shocks and struts 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties 
the company determines the estimated value of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
an increase of one percentage point in the estimated percentage of warranted products likely to be redeemed in the us would have the effect of changing midas december  outstanding us warranty liability by million 
a change in the estimated current cost of warranty redemptions of one dollar would have the effect of changing midas outstanding us warranty liability by million 
prior to fiscal  the company had not maintained an accrual for estimated future warranty claims related to its lifetime guarantee of exhaust and brake products 
instead  the company recorded expenses related to these product warranties as warranty claims were incurred 
this was due to the fact that the average warranty claim generated gross profit to the company  as the revenues and gross profit to midas from a warranty claim exceeded the cost of reimbursement to the franchisee 
as a result of the fiscal outsourcing of the midas distribution function to autozone  inc in the us  and uni select inc in canada  midas no longer generates sufficient gross profit on a warranty claim to offset the average warranty claim reimbursement 
consequently  the company recorded charges during fiscal to reflect its estimated liability associated with outstanding warranties in the us and canada 
since the warranty accrual was established in fiscal  midas has accrued for the expected future cost of warranty redemptions at the time of the original installation of the warranted part based on the method described above 
this treatment did not affect cash flow associated with warranty redemptions in either the u 
s or canada 

table of contents inventory valuation as a manufacturer and distributor of certain automotive aftermarket parts  inventory has historically represented a substantial portion of the total assets of the company 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
inventory cost is determined using the weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
additionally  the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes having adequate allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this evaluation the company considers historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  and actual margins generated from sales of its products 
during fiscal years  and  the company sold and liquidated inventory in connection with the implementation of its ongoing business transformation 
the company recorded charges in fiscal years  and to write down certain inventories to their net realizable value as a result of the company s exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution  the outsourcing of the company s wholesale parts distribution operation and the disposition of pwi 
in assessing the net realizable value of the inventory that was to be sold and liquidated  the company considered original cost  past and projected usage  independent third party appraisals and offers made by potential buyers 
valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectibility of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis 
when valuing outstanding receivable balances  the company also considered the reduced collection efforts that result from the exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution  the outsourcing of wholesale parts distribution  and the disposition of pwi  as well as the increased likelihood that customers will not pay amounts due 
pensions the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate

 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the balance sheet representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
this represents the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
when it is necessary to establish an additional minimum pension liability  an amount is recorded as an intangible asset limited to unrecognized prior service cost 
any amount in excess of unrecognized prior service cost is recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity through cumulative other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the balance sheet

table of contents approximately million pertaining to the partial wind up of the canadian salaried pension plan and the full wind up of the canadian hourly pension plan  was recorded in the company s balance sheet as an million prepaid pension asset and a million accrued pension liability 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining this rate the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas no 
and is recognized to net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
the company assumed a long term rate of return on pension assets of in both fiscal and  and experienced gains on plan assets of million in fiscal and million in fiscal carrying values of long lived assets midas evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by asset group 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the related assets does not exceed the carrying values of the assets  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company writes down fixed assets to their estimated recovery value 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to reflect the impairment of certain long lived assets related to the manufacturing and distribution of exhaust 
these assets have been liquidated 
in fiscal  the company determined that impairment existed with respect to long lived assets used in company operated shops 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge to operating expense of million and reduced long lived assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to goodwill and million to long lived assets related to the company operated shops 
deferred income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these 
table of contents deductible differences at december  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carryovers because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
self insurance reserves historically  the company has been largely self insured with respect to workers compensation and general liability claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchased stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
as of january   the company is no longer self insured with respect to workers compensation and general liability claims and has converted to a fully insured program 
in addition  on january   the company ended its self insured program with respect to employee medical claims and converted to a fully insured medical program 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims under its former self insurance programs as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average monthly claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review
