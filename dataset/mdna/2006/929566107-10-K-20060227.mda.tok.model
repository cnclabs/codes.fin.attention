item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to reposition wabash 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our new credit facility  and contractual commitments 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through its retail branch network 
executive summary the year marks the third year of recovery for the industry after a three year downturn 
during this period  we repositioned wabash by focusing on the continuous improvement of our manufacturing and retail operations  expanding our customer base  introducing products that meet customers needs  exiting non core operations and strengthening our capital structure 
we believe wabash is positioned to fully participate in the market growth that analysts are predicting will continue through operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety environmental  quality  productivity and cost reduction 
our objective of being better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety environmental 
we have maintained our four fold reduction in total recordable incident rate since june we have reduced our workers compensation costs in by approximately from we maintain iso registration of our environmental management system 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
in  we abandoned the more limited measurement of monitoring workmanship issues first pass yield and introduced process yield py  which measures the performance impact from all aspects of the supply chain manufacturing process has on our ability to ship trailers at the end of the production process 
external performance 
we measure warranty claims per units produced among other measures 
we utilize this information  along with other data  to drive continuous improvement initiatives relative to product quality and reliability 
through these efforts  second half warranty claim rates reflected an improvement of compared to productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas translate into increased available capacity  which we estimate to be over  units annually based on a three shift  five day work week 
effective management of inventory has resulted in inventory turns  which is a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency  of currently turns per year compared to approximately six turns in cost reduction 
during  we introduced our continuous improvement initiative ci 
since introduction  over ci events have been completed with coming in of which were conducted at retail branch locations 
as of december  ci has become a way of life  not only in our manufacturing operations  but also in our branch operations as well 
ci events have been successful in improving our overall trailer production process including labor hours per trailer  as well as the ability to better manage inventory levels and improve efficiency of branch service work 
industry trends freight transportation in the united states  according to the american trucking association ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in the latest date such information is available 
ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment  accounting for approximately of freight industry revenue in the united states 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
information is obtained from sources such as act research co  llc act  ata  cass logistics  and eno transportation foundation 
recent trends we have observed include the following improvement in the number of units shipped 
after reaching a high of approximately  units shipped in  shipments by the us trailer industry declined to approximately  units in each of and unit shipments rebounded to approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
act estimates shipments will be approximately  in both and our view is that shipments will be approximately to lower than the act forecast due to the impact of raw material costs on trailer prices and tractor purchases in advance of new emission regulations 
increasing age of truckload motor carrier trailer fleets 
during the three year period ending december   the latest date such information is available the average age of trailer fleets increased from approximately months to months 
we believe this increase resulted in part from deferred purchases by many motor carriers 
this trend suggests to us that there may be pent up replacement demand for trailers 
continuing strong rate of new trailer orders 
according to act  quarterly industry order placement rates remain strong  achieving per month ranges of  to  in  and  to  in total trailer orders in were  units  a increase from  units ordered in the average order rates experienced in the first and fourth quarters of of  units and  units  respectively  were the strongest quarterly average order rates since other developments 
other developments and our view of their potential impact on the industry include new us federal truck emission regulations will take effect in  resulting in cleaner  yet less fuel efficient and costlier tractor engines 
as a consequence  many trucking firms are accelerating purchases of tractors prior to the effective date of the regulation  significantly reducing the historical trailer to tractor ratio of to  to closer to to during and  according to act 
while we foresee the trailer to tractor ratio continuing at this level in  we believe the ratio will rebound thereafter  but is unlikely to return to prior historic norms and could result in a significant increased demand in trailers 
technology advances in trailer tracking and route management implemented by motor carriers  which have led to increased trailer utilization and lowered trailer to tractor ratios and could result in reduced trailer demand 
new federal hours of service rules became effective in january and to date  the regulations regarding driver hours have had no discernible impact on our business 
truck driver shortages experienced over the past several years have constrained freight market capacity growth in large part due to the difficulty in hiring and retaining drivers 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to grow and we therefore expect that the majority of freight will still be moved by truck 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales loss on asset impairment gross profit general and administrative expense selling expense income loss from operations interest expense foreign exchange gains and losses  net loss on debt extinguishment other  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss compared to net sales net sales in increased million compared to the period 
by business segment  net external sales and related units sold were as follows in millions  except unit data year ended december  change sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailers units manufacturing retail and distribution total used trailers manufacturing segment sales increased due to higher unit volumes and prices  which were offset  in part  by a change in product mix resulting from an increased percentage of lower priced double  container and converter dolly units in as compared to the increase in sales prices resulted from our ability to pass through most increases in raw material costs 
the volume increase was driven by increases in the overall van industry  as well as our increased market share  penetration into the mid market and ability to add customers 
sales for in the retail and distribution segment were up million compared to the prior year 
new trailer sales in this segment increased million primarily as a result of higher selling prices  which outpaced the impact of a decline in unit volume 
an increase in used trailer sales of million was achieved despite inventory constraints through the first three quarters of  as selling prices were positively impacted by market conditions and product mix 
sales for parts and service declined million compared to the period  due to having seven fewer full service branches during part or all of leasing revenues declined million in from  as we continue to wind down that business 
gross profit gross profit in increased million to million compared to million in gross profit as a percent of sales was compared to in as discussed below  both of our segments were impacted as follows in millions year ended december  change gross profit by segment manufacturing retail and distribution intercompany profit eliminations total gross profit the manufacturing segment s gross profit in was positively impacted by an increase in unit volume over and our ability to raise prices to offset increases in average per trailer raw material costs  including the effects of product mix 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  a percentage point decrease from the decrease in margin percentage was impacted by product mix including a larger percentage of lower margin units being sold in as compared  manufacturing inefficiencies that arose towards the end of the second quarter related to the utilization of personnel  parts shortages and an increased focus on product quality  and start up inefficiencies in the production of a new container product resulted in higher material  labor and overhead costs per unit 
further  gross profit in was negatively impacted by higher warranty expense of million due in large part to additional provision for trailers produced prior to we also incurred additional trailer delivery costs of million in compared to the period benefited from the favorable outcome of residual contingencies of million 
the retail and distribution segment attained improved gross profit in through favorable market conditions and internal initiatives 
the retail and distribution segment s gross profit as a percent of sales increased to in from in parts and service margins as a percent of sales were up in compared to due to favorable parts pricing policy changes and service productivity gains from ci initiatives 
used trailer margins were up in due to the overall strength of the used trailer market 
new trailer margins declined slightly in as selling price increases were unable to fully offset material cost increases 
the period includes million of profit related to roadrailer bogies from our finance and leasing business and million of expense related to software that become fully amortized in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in from million in primarily due to reductions in outside professional fees and compensation costs 
the period included a recovery of taxes of million 
other income expense interest expense totaled million in  a decrease of million from primarily due to reduced borrowings 
loss on debt extinguishment in of million represents the write off of deferred debt costs associated with the pay off of our bank term loan with proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
other  net in was income of million compared to income of million in the income in was primarily related to gains on the sale of properties 
income taxes in  we analyzed our projected future income and determined that a portion of our previously reserved deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on criteria set forth in sfas no 
as a result  we have reversed million of valuation allowance previously recorded 
in addition  we utilized million of net operating losses nol to offset current year income 
we recognized income tax expense of million in the period primarily related to federal and state alternative minimum tax amt 
we also have a us federal tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which will expire beginning in  if unused  and which may be subject to other limitations under irs rules 
compared to net sales net sales in increased million compared to the period 
the year included million of sales associated with our rental and leasing and aftermarket parts distribution businesses sold in september asset sale 
by business segment  net sales to external customers and related units sold were as follows in millions year ended december  change net sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailer units manufacturing retail and distribution total used trailer units improved conditions in both the overall economy and the transportation industry coupled with the expansion of our customer base  drove a increase in unit volume in our manufacturing segment in in response to significant increases in raw material prices  we increased our average selling price throughout the year 
in the fourth quarter of  our average selling price increased approximately compared to the period with the full year increase being approximately 
the sales in our retail and distribution segment were lower than in the prior year period  which included million of sales associated with the aforementioned asset sale 
a million increase in new trailer sales resulting from a increase in units  which was partially offset by reductions in used trailer sales 
the decrease in used trailer sales resulted from constrained used equipment availability  as transportation companies retained equipment to meet requirements 
branch parts and service sales were up approximately despite closing four full service locations in and one during gross profit gross profit as a percent of sales was in compared to in  which included a million asset impairment charge taken on certain assets of our rental and leasing and aftermarket parts assets 
as discussed below  both of our segments contributed to the increase in gross profit from to as follows in millions years ended december  change gross profit loss by segment manufacturing retail and distribution intercompany profit eliminations total gross profit the manufacturing segment s gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  a percentage point increase from the prior year period 
during  due to increases in our key raw materials principally steel and wood  our average per trailer raw material costs  including the effects of product mix increased from the prior period  which exceeded increases in our average selling prices resulting in a negative impact on gross profit of million 
the shortfall from rising material costs was more than offset by the continued improvement in our labor and overhead utilization of million  the impact of higher volumes of million and a reduction in warranty expense of million 
the gross profit in our retail and distribution segment improved million from the prior year  despite the loss of million of gross profit attributable to the asset sale in the period also included a million asset impairment charge associated with the asset sale 
gross profit in was positively impacted by higher new trailer volumes and margins and improved used trailer margins  offset by continued constraints on used trailer volumes 
the period included million of profit related to the sale of used roadrailer bogies 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for of million were flat compared to the prior year 
the period included million in increased technology costs and charges of million related to legal settlements 
the period included million in debt refinancing costs  million in costs from operations affected by the asset sale and million related to branch closings 
selling expense selling expense decreased million to million in  compared to million in the prior year due to the impact of the asset sale and the closing of branch locations during other income expense interest expense totaled million in  a decrease of million from the prior year due to lower effective interest rates resulting from our debt refinancing completed in the third quarter of and reduced average borrowings 
foreign exchange gains were million in and million in the large gain in reflected the significant weakening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar 
loss on debt extinguishment was million in and million in the loss represents the additional costs associated with the early extinguishment of our senior notes and certain bank debt 
the loss represents the write off of deferred debt costs associated with the pay off of a term loan in the fourth quarter with proceeds from a common stock issuance 
other  net was income of million in  compared to an expense of million for the period included gains of million on the sale of closed locations  offset by a million write down of branch locations to be disposed of 
the period included a million loss on the sale of a large portion of our finance portfolio  a million charge for the settlement of a legacy roadrailer transaction and a million loss on the sale of certain assets  offset by million of gains on the sale of closed branch properties 
income taxes in  we recognized income tax expense of million primarily related to federal and state amt 
the income tax expense is significantly below the normal statutory tax rate primarily because of the utilization of nol carryforwards 
no income tax expense or benefit was recognized in because of uncertainty related to the realizability of nols in excess of those utilized  a full valuation allowance was recorded against deferred tax assets at december  liquidity and capital resources capital structure today  our capital structure is comprised of a mix of equity and debt 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio is approximately our objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal working capital requirements and capital expenditures and be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities 
debt amendment on february   we entered into a consent and second amendment of our amended and restated loan and security agreement with our lenders 
the consent allows the completion of an acquisition currently being considered  as long as the total consideration paid in the acquisition does not exceed million 
additionally  the definition of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was amended to exclude expenses relating to stock options and restricted stock grants  which are additional add backs to ebitda 
on september   we entered into an amendment of our loan and security agreement with our lenders to  among other things  allow dividend payments up to million per fiscal year and allow the repurchase of up to million of common stock over the remaining term of the agreement 
under the repurchase program  adopted by our board of directors on september   we may repurchase up to two million shares of our common stock on the open market or in private transactions  at times and amounts deemed appropriate 
we may limit or terminate the program at any time 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased  shares at a cost of million 
also during  we declared dividends of approximately million  of which million was paid during cash flow operating activities provided million in cash in compared to million in increased working capital requirements more than offset improved net income adjusted for non cash items of million as outlined below accounts receivables increased million during compared to an increase of million in  reflecting the higher level of fourth quarter sales in both years 
days sales outstanding dso  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding  was approximately days in compared to days in the increase in dso from was primarily due to the timing of collections 
inventory increased million during compared to an increase of million in the increase includes higher raw material  work in process wip and used trailer inventories as follows raw materials inventory higher raw material costs and inventory levels to meet year end production  wip higher number of units off line awaiting customer inspection  and used trailer inventories increased fleet trade activity during the second half of the year 
the increase resulted from raw materials cost increases of approximately and early purchase of approximately million in raw materials in advance of announced price increases  partially offset by  reductions in new and used trailer units 
inventory turns  a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency that measures how quickly inventory turns  were times in and investing activities used million in cash during  an increase of million from the increase reflects increased capital expenditures associated with production line automation and implementation of an enterprise resource system 
financing activities used million of cash during  a decrease of million from the cash used in primarily reflects payments of dividends and repurchase of common stock  as revolver borrowing activity was minimal 
the period includes the repayment of million in debt from proceeds of a million issuance of common stock with the remainder coming from operating cash flows 
capital expenditures capital spending amounted to approximately million for and is anticipated to be in the range of million for spending in is planned to include approximately million for the second and third phases of a million multi year program to replace four trailer assembly lines and approximately million or roughly half of a two year erp project with the remainder targeted for normal maintenance and continuous improvement initiatives 
outlook for wabash and the trailer industry  was another year of growth 
the industry recovery that began in continued in and is expected to continue into and beyond 
act is forecasting trailer industry production of approximately  units in both and act has further reported that industry order rates continue to be healthy with cancellations remaining lower than expected 
as we look ahead to  we anticipate only a modest increase in van industry production 
act is estimating that the industry will ship  units in compared to  shipped in we expect to sell  vans in  compared to  in this modest industry growth reflects the impact of expected tractor purchases in advance of emission regulations that become effective in although industry growth overall is expected to be modest  we expect to achieve a market share growth in through the continued emphasis on our duraplate and refrigerated trailer products and expanded mid market presence 
we expect to participate in the industry growth because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate trailer continues to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailers maintenance costs  and we expect some expansion of our presence into the middle market carriers 
in  we added approximately new mid market customers and sold approximately  units to this segment of the market 
since implementing our mid market sales strategy two years ago  we have added over new customers accounting for orders for over  new trailers 
the year will also see us facing continued pressures from raw material and component pricing and evaluating our container business 
recently  we have seen a return of aluminum price increases  and we regularly experienced tire surcharges in as has been our policy  we expect to attempt to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers 
on the container front  we continue to face pricing pressures from comparable container products manufactured overseas  and therefore will be undertaking an evaluation of our container business to determine if it can continue to be a profitable product offering 
finally  in we expect to roll out the first two alpha and beta of four automated production lines  which we anticipate will provide us costs savings as well as continue our product standardization efforts 
as of december   our cash on hand and available borrowing capacity amounted to approximately million and debt and lease obligations  both on and off the balance sheet  amounted to approximately million including million of off balance sheet operating leases 
we expect that in  wabash will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  both on and off balance sheet  as of december  are as follows millions thereafter total debt excluding interest senior convertible notes bank revolver other notes payable total debt other currency forward contracts operating leases total other other commercial commitments letters of credit purchase commitments residual guarantees total obligations residual guarantees represent purchase commitments related to certain new and used trailer transactions as well as certain equipment 
we also have purchase options of million on the aforementioned trailers and equipment 
to the extent that the value of the underlying property is less than the residual guarantee and the value is not expected to be recovered  we have recorded a loss contingency 
purchase commitments are minimum purchase commitments under a parts purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of certain assets of our aftermarket parts distribution business 
we do not believe the purchase commitments will exceed business requirements 
operating leases represent the total future minimum lease payments 
off balance sheet transactions during the second quarter of  we entered into a million three year lease of computer equipment with future minimum lease payments of million per year 
as of december   we have operating leases with future minimum lease payments of million  as disclosed in the preceding table 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for wabash s critical accounting estimates critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions balance sheet caption item required approaches used key factors accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities warranty estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims  recall campaigns and discussions with our customers 
failure rates and estimated repair costs accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate the financial capability of customers to pay for products 
we base our estimates on historical experience  the time an account is outstanding  customer s financial condition and information from credit rating services 
customer financial condition inventory lower of cost or market write downs we evaluate future demand for products  market conditions and incentive programs 
estimates are based on recent sales data  historical experience  external market analysis and third party appraisal services 
market conditions product type property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other long term assets valuation of long lived assets and investments we are required from time to time to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  and independent trailer production volume estimates 
future production estimates discount rate deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carry forwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings 
we use projected future operating results  based upon our business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity tax law changes in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our inventories would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have a significant impact on our business 
customer credit risk we sublease certain highly specialized roadrailer equipment to grupo transportation marititma mexicana sa tmm  who is experiencing financial difficulties 
in august  tmm completed the restructuring of its debt agreements and subsequently sold certain assets 
customer payments are current as of december  the customer owes us million secured by highly specialized roadrailer equipment  which due to the nature of the equipment  has a minimal recovery value 
new accounting pronouncements inventory costs in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter the statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period expenses regardless of how abnormal the circumstances 
in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of fixed overheads to the costs of conversion be based upon normal production capacity levels 
the statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that this statement will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

transcraft  with annual sales of approximately million  is one of the nation s largest designers and manufacturers of flatbed and drop deck trailers 
subject to completion of contract negotiations and bank and board approvals  the parties believe that the possible transaction could be completed during the first quarter of however  there is no assurance that it will occur 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had no outstanding raw material purchase commitments 
if prices rise in the future  we will resume entering into fixed price contracts to limit our exposure 
because we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases  we can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
c 
foreign exchange rates we are subject to fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate that impact intercompany transactions with our canadian subsidiary  as well as us denominated transactions between the canadian subsidiaries and unrelated parties 
a five cent change in the canadian exchange rate would result in an approximately million impact on results of operations 
we have purchased canadian dollar foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate potential canadian currency fluctuation impact on working capital requirements 
as of december   we had outstanding million in forward contracts to be settled in various increments over the next two months 
the contracts are marked to market and not subject to hedge accounting 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
