item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genetics company committed to providing the best genetic analysis products and services that translate genomic science into superior solutions for the biomedical research and agricultural markets 
our proprietary massarray system  comprised of hardware  software applications  and consumable chips and reagents  is a high performance nucleic acid analysis platform that quantitatively and precisely measures genetic target material and variations therein 
in late  we launched our services business which provides genetic analysis services to customers as a complement and as an alternative to our systems product offerings 
our research and development efforts are committed to producing new and improved applications for our massarray system that will deliver greater system versatility and also reduce the cost per data point generated 
our research and development efforts are also directed to the development of diagnostic tests  particularly non invasive prenatal diagnostics  for use on the massarray system and potentially other platforms 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our massarray hardware  software and consumable products 
our standard massarray system combines four basic components proprietary analytical reaction technology and sample preparation and dispensing hardware to prepare dna for analysis  a coated silicon chip known as the spectrochip bioarray  a mass spectrometer  which uses an established analytical method that we have adapted for dna analysis  and bioinformatics software that records  calculates  and reports the data generated by the mass spectrometer 
each of these components contributes to a high level of performance in terms of speed  accuracy  and cost efficiency 
we have been selling massarray products since we have sold approximately systems worldwide  and massarray technology is accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis system 
our list of customers includes clinical research laboratories  biotechnology companies  and government agencies 
to maximize market penetration and provide customer support for our expanding user base  we have established direct sales and support personnel serving north america  europe and asia  in addition to regional distribution partners in france  india  israel  japan  korea  new zealand  singapore  taiwan  and turkey 
genetic analysis is primarily conducted in two key biomedical research market sectors the academic research market  where we currently focus  and the clinical analysis market  where we are expanding 
the 
table of contents research market is a relatively small market and is mainly comprised of academic institutions  which make initial genetic discoveries 
however  it is the source of discoveries of new genetic content 
the clinical analysis market is significantly larger and takes the genetic analysis a step further to establish the use of genes and genetic markers for the potential benefit of the general population 
the needs of these markets differ significantly 
the academic research market  which requires highest data density per sample  is more tolerant to inconsistencies in data and error rates  and typically has a shorter window of opportunity 
sample throughput is very high 
the academic research market is extremely price competitive 
the clinical analysis market is typically interested in a defined number of markers per sample  is not as tolerant to inconsistencies and error rates  typically has a longer development cycle  and is less price competitive 
sample throughput requirements are not nearly as high 
considering the clinical analysis market s requirements and the strengths of the massarray system  including its high sensitivity  specificity  and reproducibility  we believe there is significant opportunity to be more competitive in the clinical analysis market 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping and performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing  and gene expression analysis in the molecular medicine market 
we support epigenetic analysis the analysis of dna methylation we also plan to broaden the markets to which we sell our product line 
we have identified four target segments for potential growth clinical research and clinical marker validation  the emerging field of molecular medicine  diagnostic service laboratories  and animal testing laboratories 
as of december   our product revenues consisted of revenues from the sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables  and maintenance agreements 
the impact of our massarray compact system  our iplex assay  and other new products and product applications on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we expect revenues from our out licensing efforts with respect to our disease gene discoveries to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
to the extent that revenues are realized  if at all  they may fluctuate significantly as revenues will be based upon out licensing of gene and target related intellectual property  the occurrence of certain milestones  and successful product development and commercialization  all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict 
as a result  our entitlement to  and the timing and amounts of  any licensing and milestone payments and royalty or revenue sharing payments on future diagnostic product sales are uncertain and difficult to predict 
to achieve such revenues we will likely be dependent upon the efforts  resources and success of future licensees who may need to invest significant dollar amounts in research and development efforts  clinical trials  and obtaining regulatory approvals over several years 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments totaling million and working capital of million 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
during  we used million in cash  restricted cash  and short term investments 
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will only be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations  and capital requirements through the second quarter of unless we complete the proposed financing transaction discussed below 
in september  we instituted a cost reduction program that included a reduction in workforce and related payroll costs 
through december   we funded our capital requirements primarily with the net proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock of approximately million  with private placements 
table of contents of equity securities of approximately million  and with million from the acquisition of gemini genomics in on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with three investors that provides for the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the investors for gross proceeds to us of million not including any proceeds from exercise of the warrants 
on march   we amended and restated the securities purchase agreement to add a fourth investor and increase the gross proceeds to million not including proceeds from exercise of the warrants 
under the amended and restated securities purchase agreement  we will issue to the investors  subject to the approval of our stockholders and the satisfaction of various closing conditions  i an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and ii seven year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to certain antidilution protections and other adjustment provisions 
the proposed financing transaction is subject to stockholder approval and various other closing conditions  including no material adverse change in our business  operations  financial condition  or results of operations prior to the closing and only a specified amount of indebtedness outstanding as of the closing 
we intend to seek approval of the proposed financing transaction  an increase in the authorized number of shares of our common stock  and certain other matters at our annual meeting of stockholders 
if we do not complete the proposed financing transaction for any reason  we would be forced to preserve our cash position through a combination of additional cost reduction measures  sales of assets likely at values significantly below their potential worth  or the pursuit of alternative financing transactions that would likely be on terms substantially more disadvantageous to us and dilutive to our stockholders 
we would need to augment our cash through additional and possibly repetitive dilutive financings 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we could be forced to discontinue our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions as set forth by current accounting rules  which primarily include the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
in accordance with sab no 
 revenues are recognized  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with standard payment terms of net days are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer or when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our 
table of contents proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer or the duration of the software license 
we recognize revenue on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from snp validation services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts were not determinable at the time of acquisition  we estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies and the related integration costs in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
and sfas no 
 business combinations 
amounts accrued relating to acquisition and integration costs totaled million and as of december  approximately million remained accrued 
the amount accrued at december  represents all remaining lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million from existing subleased space 
if we do not receive all the amounts due to us under non cancelable subleases  we will incur additional expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
an impairment charge of million related to intangible assets acquired from axiom  which were determined to have no alternative future use was recorded in following the closure of our internal drug discovery program 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded in or intangible assets  primarily resulting from the acquisition of gemini genomics  totaled million  net of accumulated amortization  at december  reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
during  slow moving inventory reserves of million were charged to cost of goods sold  and the total reserve was million at december  new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and 
table of contents wasted material spoilage 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs during the fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment 
sfas no 
r eliminates  among other items  the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting contained in accounting principles bulletin apb no 
 and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
we are applying the modified prospective method and are expensing amounts related to employee stock options  restricted stock and stock issued under our employee equity incentive plans using the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees effective january  while we have not yet completed our analysis  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb no 
 accounting changes and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principles 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income in the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
product revenues are derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables including our proprietary spectrochip bioarray  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  maintenance contracts  and license fees from end users 
revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  from the year ended december   primarily from a reduction in sales of consumables from million to million and a reduction in research revenues from million to million 
consumable sales decreased from million in to million in and further declined to million in this reduction in consumables revenue was a result of a decline in our average selling prices and volumes for our spectrochip bioarray chips and other consumables 
our customers are increasing their multiplex testing levels on their samples  which in turn reduces the number of chips they consume 
competitive pressures have resulted in us lowering our consumables pricing to reduce the overall cost per genotype for our customers 
we expect average volumes of consumables per installed system to decline as more lower throughput massarray compact systems are placed in use 
hardware sales revenue declined from million in to million in and increased to million in during  the market for our high throughput systems became increasingly saturated 
we launched the compact system in the first quarter of  to address the larger market of customers with lower throughput requirements 
the sales cycle for the massarray compact system continues to be lengthy 
the lower price point for the massarray compact system has not resulted in a shorter sales cycle as we had originally expected  and resulted in lower average selling prices 
as of december   we had shipped inventory  consisting primarily of hardware  with a cost of million to certain customers in respect of purchase orders or contracts received which did not meet our criteria 
table of contents for revenue recognition 
we expect to recognize million of revenue in respect of these shipments upon receipt of payment from or delivery of software products to these customers during the quarter ending march  research revenue increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in we performed more work on our grants in as our largest collaborator began to transfer samples to us for investigation 
the timing of research revenues depends upon our expenditures on grant research and the receipt of the grant funding from the sponsoring agencies 
we expect grant revenue to be minimal going forward 
domestic and non us revenues were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  our distribution contract with one asia based distributor  representing million of revenue in  expired on december  revenue for this same distributor was million in we expect revenue from present and future out licensing of our disease gene discoveries to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the unpredictable sales cycle for the massarray compact system  revenue recognition criteria  and the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services 
while the launch of our iplex assay may result in individual customers purchasing less consumables overall compared to prior periods because their assay efficiency has increased  we believe that the iplex assay will facilitate an increase in demand for the massarray system that will result in an increase in system sales for compared to additionally  we currently have a robust sales pipeline  and we shipped inventory in with a sales value of million that did not initially meet revenue recognition criteria 
based on these factors  we expect increased revenues in the first and second quarter of  compared to the same periods in we also expect that overall revenues for for system sales will be slightly greater than overall revenues for consumables as a result of our iplex assay 
while we generally expect increased revenues in  compared to  if our customers perform more studies  compared to prior periods  on the massarray system due to the increase in efficiency provided by the iplex assay  we may experience higher than expected consumable and total revenues 
cost of product and service revenues and gross margins cost of product revenues were million  million  and million and gross margins were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  higher margin consumables constituted of the mix of products sold  down from in  while lower margin hardware sales increased to in from in this change in product mix resulted in lower overall margins in  as compared to during  higher margin consumables constituted of the mix of products sold  up from in  while lower margin hardware sales declined to in from in this change in product mix resulted in higher overall margins in as compared to  despite a reduction in margin on hardware sales in due to competitive price pressure 
gross margin was reduced by in due to an increase in the obsolescence reserve expense of million in to million in we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  reductions in the selling price for systems and consumables  lower consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of products sold  competitive conditions  sales volumes  discounts offered  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies 

table of contents cost of service revenues were million and million  respectively  and gross margins were and  respectively  for the years ended december  and there were no service revenues or cost of service revenues for the year ended december  gross margins are dependent on the particular service contract terms of the work undertaken in each year 
research and development costs research and development costs decreased to million from million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  improvements to our existing products and validation of products under development  expenses relating to work performed under research contracts  and  prior to the termination of our internal drug discovery activities in july of  expenses related to our disease gene discovery and development programs 
the reduction in costs from to of million resulted from a reduction in operating supplies of million following the closure of our disease gene discovery program in july  million in depreciation as assets reached the end of their useful life  and million in headcount related costs due to headcount reduction 
these decreases were offset by million of expenses associated with the acquisition of the non invasive prenatal intellectual property rights from isis innovation ltd 
in october the reduction in costs from to of million resulted from a reduction in operating supplies of million following completion of our genetic scans in and the closure of our disease gene discovery program in july  million in depreciation as assets reached the end of their useful life  and million in headcount related costs due to headcount reduction 
these decreases were offset by a reduction of million of absorption into cost of service contracts following the reduction in service contract volume in from we expect our research and development expenses during to be consistent with as the cost savings from our cost reduction program initiated in september will be offset by investment in our core technology and development of non invasive prenatal nucleic acid based tests 
sales and marketing costs sales and marketing costs decreased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   and from million in the year ended december  these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing  customer support  and business development personnel and their related department expenses 
the decrease in expense of million from to was primarily due to reduction in foreign selling expenses of million following a reduction in headcount in  reduced consulting costs of million as consulting projects were eliminated  increased absorption into cost of goods sold of million  and reduced travel costs of million 
these reductions were offset by increased us headcount related expenses of million 
the decrease in expense of million from to was primarily due to reduction in selling expenses in germany of million following a reduction in headcount in  reduced depreciation of million as assets were fully depreciated  reduced travel costs of million due to lower headcount  and reduced operating supplies of million 
these increases were offset by increased us headcount expenses of million and promotional expenses of million 
we expect our sales and marketing headcount and associated expense in to be consistent with as the cost savings from our cost reduction program initiated in september will be offset by costs associated with development of non invasive prenatal nucleic acid based tests as well as costs associated with new products for our massarray system 

table of contents general and administrative costs general and administrative costs decreased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   and from million in the year ended december  these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for legal  finance  and human resource personnel  and their related department expenses 
the decrease from to of million related to cost savings in legal fees of million due to reduced patent portfolio expenses  a decrease in building operating costs of million  increased absorption into cost of goods sold of million  and lower insurance costs due to reduced premiums of million 
these reductions were offset by an increase in headcount costs of million  increased property taxes of million  and other expenses of million 
the decrease from to of million related to cost savings in legal fees of million due to reduced patent portfolio expenses  headcount reductions of million  a reduction in property and other taxes of million  and lower insurance costs due to reduced premiums of million 
these reductions were offset by an increase in building operating costs of million and other expenses of million 
we expect general and administrative costs to decrease in  compared to as a result of the cost savings as a result of our cost reduction program initiated in september asset impairment and restructuring charges during the third quarter of  as part of our strategy to stabilize the genetic systems business  we introduced a cost reduction plan  which included a reduction of existing headcount by approximately across all departments by the end of we incurred a charge of million in relating to severance and related expenses in connection with this headcount reduction 
at december   we had an accrued balance of million in respect of the restructuring charges representing the remaining payout of severance costs 
we expect to pay the remaining amounts due through the second quarter of we terminated our internal drug discovery efforts during the third quarter of  which reduced our headcount by approximately by the end of during  we incurred total charges of million related to the closure of these activities 
we expect to incur no further costs with respect to this restructuring 
of the million charge  million related to non cash charges from the write off of million on equipment taken out of service  million related to intangible assets of no value to our ongoing business and million related to employee severance costs and other contractual obligations 
during the first quarter of  we sold certain tangible assets and recovered million in excess of the carrying value  which we had previously fully provided for as part of the restructuring charge 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights 
in connection with the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including patent rights  human cell banks  and assay technology 
these intangible assets are being amortized over three to five years 
the   and amortization charge of million  million  and million  respectively  represents the amortization of all these assets held throughout the respective year 
the reduction in expense is primarily due to an adjustment to the carrying value of assets related to the gemini acquisition of million in interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in  and million in the decreases resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of interest bearing investments 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million in  compared to million in  and million in the decreases resulted from our lower level of borrowings as we pay off our capital leases 
in december  we paid the remaining balance of million under our credit facility with a financial institution 
as a result  we expect our interest expense to decline in deferred income tax benefit the deferred tax benefit of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  were due to the amortization on the intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights  acquired from gemini genomics 
at december   we have federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
approximately million of the state tax loss carryforwards will expire in and a portion of the state tax loss carry forwards will continue to expire in unless previously utilized 
we incurred a federal and state capital loss on the disposal of two of our foreign subsidiaries in totaling million 
the capital loss carryforward will expire in we also have german and united kingdom uk net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be carried forward indefinitely 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  use of our federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash totaled million  compared to million at december  our cash reserves are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including investment grade corporate bonds  commercial paper  and money market accounts 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments totaling million and working capital of million 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
during  we used million in cash  restricted cash  and short term investments 
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will only be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations  and capital requirements through the second quarter of unless we complete the proposed financing transaction discussed below 
in september  we instituted a cost reduction program that included a reduction in workforce and related payroll costs 
through december   we funded our capital requirements primarily with the net proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock of approximately million  with private placements of equity securities of approximately million  and with million from the acquisition of gemini genomics in on march   we entered into an amended and restated securities purchase agreement with four investors that provides for the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for gross proceeds to us of million not including any proceeds from exercise of the warrants 
the proposed financing is 
table of contents subject to stockholder approval and the satisfaction of various other closing conditions  including no material adverse change in our business  operations  financial condition or results of operations prior to the closing and only a specified amount of indebtedness outstanding as of the closing 
if we do not complete the proposed financing transaction for any reason  we would be forced to preserve our cash position through a combination of additional cost reduction measures  sales of assets likely at values significantly below their potential worth  or the pursuit of alternative financing transactions that would likely be on terms substantially more disadvantageous to us and dilutive to our stockholders 
we would need to augment our cash through additional and possibly repetitive dilutive financings 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we could be forced to discontinue our operations 
accordingly  the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we consider the material drivers of our cash flow to be sales volumes  inventory management and operating expenses 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash used in operations for year ended december  was million compared to million for the use of cash was primarily a result of the net loss of million for year ended december   adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization of million  million of deferred income tax benefit  reductions in accounts receivable balances of million due to lower sales activity and reduced time taken to collect receivables  reductions of million in inventory levels from inventory management and valuation reserves  increases in other liabilities of million  and increases in accounts payable and deferred income of million 
at our current and anticipated level of operating loss  we expect to continue to incur an operating cash outflow on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
investing activities  other than the changes in our short term investments and restricted cash  used million in cash during due to purchases of additional laboratory equipment 
net cash used by financing activities was million for year ended december  compared to million used by financing activities in financing activities during included net payments of million for long term debt and capital leases  which included the pay off of a cash secured note with a bank of million in december  and the receipt of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases of million 
on september   we received a notice from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market stating that for the last consecutive business days  the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
pursuant to nasdaq marketplace rule e  we were provided until march  to regain compliance 
on march   we received a letter from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market notifying us that our common stock will be delisted  and that we may appeal the staff s determination to a listing qualifications panel 
the letter also states that  alternatively  we may apply to transfer our common stock to the nasdaq capital market if we satisfy the requirements for initial inclusion on the nasdaq capital market  other than the minimum bid price rule  and that if the application is approved  we will be afforded the remainder of the nasdaq capital market s additional day compliance period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule while on the nasdaq capital market 
if we do not return to compliance after the second day period  nasdaq will issue a letter informing us that they will delist our common stock from the nasdaq capital market 
we can then request a hearing with nasdaq to discuss the issue 
on march   we submitted our request for an appeal to the listing qualifications panel of the staff s determination to delist our common stock 
we may not be successful with our appeal to the listing qualifications panel 
if we fail to continue to meet all applicable nasdaq national market or nasdaq capital market requirements in the future and nasdaq determines to delist our common stock  the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
such 
table of contents delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and or result in the loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
the following table summarized our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years after years open purchase orders long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations future operating lease commitments for leases have not been reduced by future minimum sublease rentals to be received through december aggregating million 
open purchase orders are primarily for inventory items and research and development supplies 
in september  we entered into an amendment to our lease for our corporate headquarters in san diego 
the lease amendment provides for the deferral of approximately million of the monthly rent payments by reducing the monthly payments through september  and increasing the aggregate monthly payments by the deferred amount for the remaining term of the lease  from october  to september  the total obligation under the lease remains unchanged 
the contractual obligation table above reflects the deferral of these rent payments 
other commitments and contingencies that may result in contractual obligations to pay are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will only be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through the second quarter of even if we close the proposed financing transaction  our business may require additional investment that we have not yet secured 
including the expected net proceeds from the proposed financing transaction  based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least however  the actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include but are not limited to the size of our future operating losses  the level of our success in selling our massarray products and services  our ability to introduce and sell new products and services  and successfully reduce inventory levels of earlier products  the level of our selling  general and administrative expenses  our success in and the expenses associated with researching and developing diagnostic products  alone or in collaboration with our partners  and obtaining any required regulatory approval for those products  the extent of our research and development pursuits  including our level of investment in massarray product research and development  achieving good manufacturing practice certification  and asr research and development  the extent to which we enter into  maintain  and derive revenues from licensing agreements  including agreements to out license our disease gene discoveries  research and other collaborations  joint ventures and other business arrangements

we had a million bank line of credit provided by the union bank of california  which expired on january  at december   we had outstanding stand by letters of credit with financial institutions totaling million  of which million related to a pending shipment from a supplier  million related to our asset backed loan and lease agreements and million related to our building and operating leases 
letters of credit amounting to million will not be drawn down unless we default upon our obligations under the respective agreements 
the million letter of credit will reduce in line with the amount owing under our obligations  and will be released by the end of september an operating lease letter of credit of million will remain in place until the expiration of the building lease agreement in december at december   we were in breach of one of the covenants of our capital leases  which requires us to have in excess of million of unrestricted cash and short term investments 
the lender has waived these breaches  and we provided the lender with a letter of credit for million 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants 
we have no commitments for any additional debt financings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities rated bbb or above by standard poors 
our investment policy includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
we have not experienced any significant losses in our investment portfolio as a result of rating changes 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound  or gbp  and the euro  or eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 

table of contents the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability
