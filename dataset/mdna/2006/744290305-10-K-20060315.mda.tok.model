the differentiators include our open electronic network for electronic transactions with no equity ownership in businesses engaged in the front end ie  physician practice management software system vendors and other physician desk top vendors or in the back end ie  payers  laboratories and pharmacies 
with our neutral position  we believe that we can better attract both front end and back end partners who may be more comfortable doing business with a non competitive partner 
another competitive differentiator is our presence in the clinical market 
with the nation s largest clinical laboratories as long time customers  we have worked in partnership with them to develop customized laboratory communication tools and services that are unparalleled in the industry 
we also have the oldest and most established e prescribing network in the nation  offering connectivity to over  pharmacies nationwide

zeneks was incorporated in and was established as a medical cost containment company 
they have relationships with numerous providers throughout the country 
we expect to integrate the zeneks operations into our current bill negotiation system by the end of the first quarter of fiscal sale of assets on june   we sold certain assets and liabilities of our laboratory communication solutions segment that were used in our non core contract manufacturing business to a new entity owned by a former executive of the company for million in cash 
under terms of the sale agreement  we received million in cash at closing and received the balance of million in cash in july and august following the presentation of the final accounting 
as part of the disposition  we agreed to purchase certain component parts from the new entity for use in our laboratory communication solutions business on a non exclusive basis at a fixed price deemed to be at fair market value by management 
these parts were valued at million at june  as of december   this remaining commitment has been reduced to additionally  we agreed to sublease a portion of our current facilities through july and provide certain administrative services to the new entity 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded a loss on sale of assets of million in the year ended december  this loss includes the value of options to purchase  shares of our common stock granted to the former executive at an exercise price of in july financing transactions on december   we entered into a loan transaction with laurus master fund  ltd 
laurus pursuant to which laurus extended million in financing to us in the form of a million secured term loan and a million secured revolving credit facility 
the term loan has a stated term of five years and will accrue interest at prime plus  subject to a minimum interest rate of 
the term loan is payable in equal monthly principal and interest installments of approximately  beginning april and continuing until the maturity date on december  the revolving credit facility has a stated term of three years and will accrue interest at the day libor rate plus payable monthly  subject to a minimum interest rate of  and a maturity date of december  with two one year options at the discretion of laurus 
in connection with the loan agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to laurus which was valued at approximately million on the date of issuance 
we also granted laurus a first priority security interest in substantially all of our present and future tangible and intangible assets including all intellectual property to secure our obligations under the loan agreement 
due to certain acceleration clauses contained in the agreement and a lockbox arrangement  the revolving credit facility is classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet

operating segments we currently operate in two reportable segments that are separately managed transaction services and laboratory communication solutions 
transaction services includes transaction  cost containment and other value added services principally between physicians and insurance companies and physicians and pharmacies  and laboratory communication solutions includes the sale  lease and service of communication devices principally to laboratories and  through june   the contract manufacturing of printed circuit boards 
commencing in march  the operations of plan vista are included in our transaction services segment 
as a result of a re alignment of our corporate overhead functions in the second quarter of  we now report these expenses as part of our transaction services segment 
accordingly  our corporate expenses in the comparable periods have been combined with our transaction services segment to facilitate a better comparison between periods in this section 

table of contents results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  net revenues 
consolidated net revenues for decreased by million  or  to million from consolidated net revenues of million for net revenues classified by our reportable segments are as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions net revenues in our transaction services segment for decreased by million  or  over this decrease is primarily due to declines in volumes of electronic claims  statements and other real time transactions processed decrease million 
core transactions were down compared to the prior year see below 
this negatively impacted our transaction services revenue from our edi business that was partially offset by increased revenue from our cost containment business that was generating revenues for two additional months in compared to due to the acquisition of planvista in march however  our cost containment business has seen a drop in revenue per transaction as competitive pressures have impacted pricing 
for  approximately of our consolidated revenues came from our transaction services segment compared to from this segment for this increase is attributable to the drop in revenue from our laboratory communication solutions as a result of the sale of our manufacturing unit in june laboratory communication solutions segment net revenues for decreased by million  or  from primarily as a result of the sale of the contract manufacturing assets in june this sale resulted in a decrease of million in this segments revenue in compared to additionally  we experienced a drop in revenue from our largest customer of million as a result of budgeting issues with the customer 
we anticipate that this revenue will remain at current levels during a summary of the number of transactions we processed for the periods presented is as follows in thousands core transactions additional core transactions encounters total transactions includes million cost containment transactions in the period from proxymed s acquisition of planvista core transactions represent all transactions except for encounters 
additionally  as a result of a continued review of our business  we have made changes to our transaction counts to ensure that our transactions are counted on the same methodology for all purposes  whether internal or external 
previously  we had excluded certain transactions primarily associated with an outsourcing contract due to the nature of the business model for those transactions 
these transactions are included above as additional core transactions in and cost containment transactions represent the number of claims sent by our payer clients to be re priced through our provider network and are included in the core transactions above 
encounters are administrative reporting transactions for payers but do not generate revenue for the provider who must submit them 
accordingly  rather than submitting on a routine basis  most providers choose to periodically catch up on their submissions  creating monthly and quarterly swings in both the number of encounters we process and what percentage of our transaction mix they represent 
since encounters are at a significantly lower price point than claims  these swings make it difficult to analyze our quarter over quarter growth 
table of contents in our business 
in addition  we do not expect our encounter volume to grow on an annual basis  as payers are not expanding the capitated service model that is the foundation of encounters 
therefore  we believe that breaking out encounters shows more clearly our growth in core transactions

if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of significantly diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we believe that if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing for further product development or strategic acquisitions  such inability may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our business plan and may put us at a competitive disadvantage

goodwill we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a fair value methodology 
we completed our most recent annual test at december  which was preceded by an interim impairment analysis conducted at september  which indicated our goodwill was impaired 
the december  analysis utilized cash flow based market comparables in assessing fair value for our goodwill impairment testing and we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
to the extent that future cash flows differ from those projected in our analysis  fair value of our goodwill may be affected and may result in an impairment change 
capitalized software development and research and development costs incurred internally and fees paid to outside contractors and consultants during the application development stage of our internally used software products are capitalized 
costs of upgrades and major enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized 
costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades are expensed as incurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred as research and development expenses and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
application development stage costs generally include software configuration  coding  installation to hardware and testing 
once the project is completed  capitalized costs are amortized over their remaining estimated economic life 
our judgment is used in determining whether costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we periodically review projected cash flows and other criteria in assessing the impairment of any internal use capitalized software and take impairment charges as needed 
purchased technology and other intangibles assets purchased technology and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
the carrying values of purchased technology and intangible assets are reviewed if the facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
this review indicates whether assets will be recoverable based on future expected cash flows  and  if not recoverable  whether there is an impairment of such assets 
reserve for doubtful accounts revenue allowances bad debt estimates we rely on estimates to determine revenue allowances  the bad debt expense and the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
additionally  in our medical cost containment business  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize revenue reserves based on past write off history  average percentage of receivables written off historically  and the length of time the receivables are past due 
to the extent historical credit experience is not indicative of future performance or other assumptions used by management do not prevail  loss experience could differ significantly  resulting in either higher or lower future provision for losses

 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas no 
 which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and requires retrospective application a term defined by the statement to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the effect of a change 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal and do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the company was required to adopt the provisions of fin no 
no later than the end of its fiscal year 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have any material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued eitf no 
 accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share eitf no 

eitf no 
addresses when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share and requires that contingently convertible debt instruments are to be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share regardless of whether the market price or other trigger has been met 
eitf no 
also requires that prior period diluted earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes be restated 
eitf no 
is effective for reporting periods ending after december  as a result of the issuance of eitf no 
 shares convertible from our million convertible notes may be required to be included in the calculation of our earnings per share in periods of net income  however  the fasb has yet to reach a conclusion as to the effect of non market price triggers on earnings per share calculations in situations where the instrument contains only non market price trigger  such as our convertible notes  and therefore the impact on the consolidated financial statements is not determinable at this time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  shared based payments revised 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related guidance 
sfas no 
r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments and will be recognized and expensed over the period which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
fair value is based on market prices if those prices are publicly available 
if not available  sfas r does not specifically require the use of a particular model  however  the most common models are the black scholes model and lattice binomial models 
additionally  modifications to an equity award after the grant date will require a compensation cost to be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the award immediately before the modification 
the effective date of sfas no 
r is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the impact that will result from adopting fasb no
