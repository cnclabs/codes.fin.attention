item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as required by insurance regulatory authorities  we receive an annual statement of opinion by an external consulting actuary concerning the adequacy of our reserves 
typically  as of the end of the third quarter of each year  our external actuary performs an in depth analysis of our reserves and provides us with a preliminary indication of what the actuary believes is the appropriate level for our recorded reserves 
after year end  the external actuary updates this analysis for fourth quarter development on the basis of which the actuary renders an opinion regarding the adequacy of our reserves 
as part of this year end analysis  the external actuary determines a range of reserve estimates  based on its projection methodologies  and a select amount within the range 
if our recorded reserves are not within a reasonable range of the external actuary s select amount  we adjust reserves so that they are closer to their select amount 
this external review of our reserves is one of the key factors that we rely on in our overall assessment of the adequacy of our reserves 
to the extent that the external actuary s projections produce results similar to those we have developed internally  we can be reasonably assured that our assumptions and methodologies used to project ultimate losses are adequate 
statutory accounting principles require reserves to be reported net of reinsurance 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  require reserves to be reported on a gross basis  ie  before reinsurance  with a corresponding asset established for the reinsurance recoverable 
when compared on a net basis  our statutory and gaap reserves are identical  with the exception of the reserves for extended reporting endorsements  approximately million  which are required to be carried as unearned premium reserves for statutory accounting purposes 
reinsurance 
in accordance with industry practice  we cede to other insurance companies some of the potential liability under insurance policies we have underwritten 
this practice  called reinsurance  helps us reduce our net liability on individual risks  stabilize our underwriting results and increase our underwriting capacity 
however  if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations  we remain liable for policyholder obligations 
as payment for sharing a portion of our risk  we are also required to share a part of the premium we receive on the related policies 
we determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based upon an evaluation of the risks accepted  consultations with reinsurance brokers and a review of market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually 
under our primary professional liability reinsurance contract  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers is swing rated  or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated contract is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
we pay a provisional premium during the initial policy year 
a liability is recorded to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
under our treaties  we retained the first  of loss exposure and of the next million in all markets except michigan where we generally retain the first million of loss exposure and of the next million 
we do not write any policies with limits greater than million per claim 
the following table identifies our principal reinsurers  their percentage participation in our aggregate reinsured risk based upon amounts recoverable and their respective am best ratings as of december  am best classifies an a rating as excellent and an a rating as superior

capital and surplus 
to ensure the security of our policyholders  we must maintain assets in excess of total liabilities 
this excess  or surplus  is the principal measure used by state insurance regulators  and rating agencies such as am best  to evaluate the company s financial strength 
medical professional liability insurers generally attempt to keep this surplus level at least equal to their annual net premiums written 
competition the insurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous insurance companies and various self insurance mechanisms 
many of our competitors have considerably greater financial resources and higher am best company ratings than we have 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our insurance business are service  quality  name recognition  breadth and flexibility of coverages  financial stability and  to a lesser degree  price 
we believe we compare favorably with many of our competitors based on our excellent service to customers  our close relationship with the medical community  primarily through various medical societies  which affords us a high degree of name recognition  our ability to customize product features and programs to fit the needs of our customers and our long history of financial stability 
these factors will vary by state based on the relative strength of our competitors in each market 
am best company rating am best company  or am best  rates the financial strength and ability to meet policyholder obligations of our insurance subsidiaries 
our primary insurance subsidiary  american physicians  has a b very good rating  which is the sixth highest of rating levels 
according to am best  companies rated b are deemed secure 
am best assigns a b rating to insurers that have  on average  very good balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profiles when compared to the standards established by am best  and in am best s opinion  have a good ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
an insurance company s rating is a potential source of competitive advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace 
rating agencies such as am best evaluate insurance companies based on their financial strength and ability to pay claims  factors which are more relevant to policyholders and potential customers who are purchasing insurance  and agents who are advising customers  than investors 
financial strength ratings by rating agencies are not ratings of securities or recommendations to buy  hold  or sell any security 
important agency relationship the principal agency through which we write medical professional liability insurance is scw agency group  inc  or scw 
scw is principally owned by william b 
cheeseman  our former president and chief executive officer and director 
mr 
cheeseman received no cash or other compensation  dividends or other distribution from scw while he was employed by the company 
his only benefit from his ownership interest in scw while he was an employee of the company was the potential appreciation of his investment in scw 
mr 
cheeseman ceased to be an employee of the company at the end of and ceased to be a director in commissions scw receives on premiums it writes for apcapital s insurance subsidiaries typically account for to of its revenues 
direct premiums written for us by scw during  and totaled million  million and million respectively  representing   and of the company s direct premiums written during such years 
commission expense we incurred related to scw approximated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the commission rates we have paid to scw have been either the same or less than the commission rates we paid to our other agents 
in january  we completed a new year contract with scw 
the agreement provides for american physicians to continue to be the exclusive medical professional liability carrier scw represents in the state of michigan  subject to limited exceptions  such as a downgrade of our am best rating 
however  we continue to have the right to appoint other agents 
scw may continue to represent other insurance companies in states other than michigan 
the contract provides for scw to be paid commissions consistent with the marketplace 
the terms of the new agency agreement were determined by negotiations between our management staff and scw s management  and under the review of independent consultants  and ultimately approved by our board of directors 
in rendering its approval  the board of directors considered the fairness of the agreed rates and determined that they were fair to the company based on an evaluation of market rates and agreements between the company and its other agents  among other considerations 
insurance regulatory matters general 
insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation relating to numerous aspects of their business and financial condition in the states in which they transact business 
the nature and extent of such regulation varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
our insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation by the office of financial and insurance services for the state of michigan  or ofis  and other state departments of insurance 
these regulators establish standards of solvency  license insurers and agents  establish guidelines for investments by insurers  review premium rates  review the provisions which insurers must make for current losses and future liabilities  review transactions involving a change in control and require the filing of periodic reports relating to financial condition 
in addition  state regulatory examiners  including ofis  perform periodic financial examinations of insurance companies 
such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders 
our insurance subsidiaries together are licensed to write insurance in a total of states and are eligible to write excess and surplus lines in states 
however  we currently write excess and surplus business in only of the states where we are licensed or eligible 
our current focus of operations is on our existing states 
holding company regulation 
most states  including michigan  have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as ours 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these laws permit ofis or any other relevant insurance departments to examine apcapital s insurance subsidiaries at any time  to require disclosure of material transactions between apcapital and its insurance subsidiaries  and to require prior approval of sales or purchases of a material amount of assets and the payment of extraordinary dividends 
ofis conducted a financial examination as of december  of each of our three insurance subsidiaries 
no adjustments were proposed as a result of the examinations 
holding company laws also limit the amount of dividends payable by insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
under michigan law  the maximum dividend that may be paid to apcapital from its insurance subsidiaries during any twelve month period  without prior approval of ofis  is the greater of of each insurance company s statutory surplus  as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with ofis  or the statutory net income  excluding realized gains  for the period covered by such annual statement 
at december   the amount available for payment of dividends without the prior approval of ofis was approximately million 
change of control 
the michigan insurance code requires that ofis receive prior notice of and approve a change of control for apcapital or any of its michigan domiciled insurance subsidiaries 
the michigan insurance code contains a complete definition of control 
in simplified terms  a person  corporation  or other entity would obtain control of american physicians or apcapital if they possessed  had a right to acquire possession  or had the power to direct any other person acquiring possession  directly or indirectly  of or more of the voting securities of either company 
to obtain approval for a change of control  the proposed acquirer must file an application with ofis containing detailed information such as the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates  the sources of and amount of funds to be used to effect the acquisition  and financial information regarding the proposed acquirer 
risk based capital requirements 
in addition to other state imposed insurance laws and regulations  ofis enforces requirements developed by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk based formula that attempts to measure capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company s mix of products and investment portfolio 
under the formula  we first determine our risk based capital base level by taking into account risks with respect to our assets and underwriting risks relating to our liabilities and obligations 
we then compare our total adjusted capital to the base level 
our total adjusted capital is determined by subtracting our liabilities from our assets in accordance with rules established by ofis 
a ratio of total adjusted capital to risk based capital of less than may give rise to enhanced regulatory scrutiny or even a regulatory takeover of the insurer  depending on the extent to which the ratio is less than the ratio for our primary insurance subsidiary  american physicians  has always exceeded in the past  but there can be no assurance that the requirements applicable to american physicians will not increase in the future 
as of december   american physicians risk based capital base level was million and its total adjusted capital was million  for a ratio of the ratio of risk based capital to total adjusted capital for our other two insurance subsidiaries  apspecialty and insurance corporation of america  was and respectively  at december  iris requirements 
the naic has also developed a set of financial ratios  referred to as the insurance regulatory information system  or iris  for use by state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies 
the naic has established an acceptable range of values for each of the iris financial ratios 
generally  an insurance company will become the subject of increased scrutiny when four or more of its iris ratio results fall outside the range deemed acceptable by the naic 
the nature of increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from iris ratio results outside the acceptable range is subject to the judgment of the applicable state insurance department  but generally will result in accelerated reviews of annual and quarterly filings 
in  our primary insurance subsidiary  american physicians  did not generate any ratios that varied from values within the naic s acceptable range 
apcapital s other two insurance subsidiaries  apspecialty and insurance corporation of america both had one or more ratio values outside the naic s acceptable range  which is common for companies whose business is in run off as is the case with apspecialty and insurance corporation of america 
guaranty fund 
we participate in various guaranty associations in the states in which we write business that protect policyholders and claimants against losses due to insolvency of insurers 
when an insolvency occurs  the associations are authorized to assess member companies up to the amount of the shortfall of funds  including expenses 
member companies are assessed based on the type and amount of insurance written during the previous calendar year 
we make estimated accruals for our portion of the assessments as information becomes available 
employees as of december   we had employees 
none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining unit and we believe that employee relations are good 
uncertainties relating to forward looking statements we make forward looking statements in this report and may make such statements in future filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we may also make forward looking statements in our press releases or other public or shareholder communications 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and include information about our expectations and possible or assumed future results of our operations 
when we use words such as will  should  believes  expects  anticipates  estimates or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of for all of our forward looking statements 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
because these forward looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change  actual results could be materially different 
factors that might cause such a difference include  without limitation  the risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  including those listed in item a risk factors in this report 
other factors not currently anticipated by management may also materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake  and expressly disclaim  any obligation to publicly update or alter our statements whether as a result of new information  events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or otherwise 
item a 
risk factors 
an investment in our common stock involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the following information about these risks 
any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our future results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are as follows increased competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our products at premium rates we deem adequate  which may result in a decrease in premium volume  a decrease in our profitability  or both 
the medical professional liability insurance business tends to cycle through what are often referred to as hard and soft markets 
a hard market is generally characterized as a period of rapidly raising premium rates  tightened underwriting standards  narrowed coverage and the withdrawal of insurers from certain markets 
soft markets are usually characterized by relatively flat or slow rising premium rates  less stringent underwriting standards  expanded coverage and strong competition among insurers 
since approximately  the trend in medical professional liability has been towards a harder market 
however  the sector may again shift towards a soft market 
this change in trend and the accompanying competitive pressures could adversely impact our ability to obtain rate increases we deem necessary to adequately cover insured risks  which could ultimately result in a decrease in premium volume as physicians currently insured with us elect to place their coverage elsewhere or an increase in related underwriting and loss and loss adjustment expenses 
each of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates that may prove to be inadequate to cover our losses 
the process of estimating the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses involves significant judgment and is complex and imprecise due to the number of variables and assumptions inherent in the estimation process 
these variables include the effects on ultimate loss payments of internal factors such as changes in claims handling practices and changes in the mix of our products  as well as external factors such as changes in loss frequence and severity trends  economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative and regulatory changes 
in addition  medical professional liability claims may take several years to resolve due to typical delays in reporting claims to us  the often lengthy discovery process  and the time necessary to defend the claim 
also  claims with similar characteristics may result in very different ultimate losses depending on the state or region where the claim occurred 
all of these factors contribute to the variability in estimating ultimate loss payments  especially since the effects of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified  and may require us to make significant adjustments in our reserves from time to time 
any such adjustments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the period with respect to which the adjustment is made 
due to the current volatility of losses in the medical professional liability and workers compensation markets  adjustments have occurred in each of the last several years 
our exit from various markets and lines of business may prove more costly than originally anticipated 
our exit from various lines of business  such as the workers compensation  health and personal and commercial lines of business  and from various geographic markets could result in future charges to income due to unforeseen costs or the need for unanticipated reserve enhancements 
additional reserve enhancements may be necessary due to the volatility of loss reserves on these run off lines 
run off lines typically have increased volatility as paid claim trends often emerge differently than those that have been historically indicated  thus increasing the uncertainty inherent in reserve estimates  especially on longer tailed lines such as workers compensation 
in addition  most states where we have historically written workers compensation insurance have second injury funds and state mandated workers compensation pools for high risk employers and industries 
because of the nature of the participation in these funds and pools  they typically bear higher loss costs than traditional workers compensation insurance 
this higher risk factor  combined with the long tailed nature of workers compensation claims  means that losses related to accident years in which we participated in the pools may not yet have emerged and additional assumed losses may materialize  which could affect the profitability of our operations 
tort reform legislation may have adverse or unintended consequences that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
proposed new laws which would limit jury awards for non economic damages relating to medical malpractice claims have been a point of debate at the national level for the past several years 
while the passage of national tort reform would appear to be a positive development for our business  many states in which we operate have already enacted some version of tort reform at the state level  which in some cases is more favorable than that currently being contemplated at the national level 
if national tort reform is enacted that supersedes more favorable state tort reforms  our loss costs may increase in certain markets 
in addition  recently passed tort reform legislation in illinois has made more burdensome certain reporting requirements regarding rate filings 
as a consequence  an increase in claims frequency or severity may adversely affect our results of operations as it may be more difficult to obtain approval from regulators for rate increases the company deems necessary 
if we are unable to obtain or collect on ceded reinsurance  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we use reinsurance arrangements to limit and manage the amount of risk we retain and stabilize our underwriting results 
the amount and cost of reinsurance available to us is subject  in large part  to prevailing market conditions beyond our control 
our ability to provide insurance at competitive premium rates and coverage limits on a continuing basis depends in large part upon our ability to secure adequate reinsurance in amounts and at rates that are commercially reasonable 
furthermore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers because reinsurance does not relieve us of liability to our insureds for the risks ceded to reinsurers 
a significant reinsurer s inability or refusal to reimburse us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements would result in a charge to income that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for the period in which the charge is incurred 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain affordable reinsurance from creditworthy reinsurers 
the insurance industry is subject to regulatory oversight that may impact the manner in which we operate our business 
our insurance business is subject to extensive regulation by the applicable state agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and especially by the office of financial and insurance services for the state of michigan  or ofis  as our insurance companies are domiciled in that state 
these state agencies have broad regulatory powers designed to protect policyholders  not shareholders or other investors 
these powers include  but are not limited to  the ability to place limitations on the types and amounts of our investments  review and approve or deny premium rate increases  set standards of solvency to be met and maintained  review reserve levels  review change in control transactions  limit the ability to pay dividends  prescribe the form and content of  and to examine  our statutory basis financial statements  and place limitations on our ability to transact business with and between our affiliated insurance companies 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in consequences resulting from a regulatory examination to a regulatory takeover 
if we fail to comply with insurance industry regulations  or if those regulations become more burdensome to us  we may not be able to operate profitably or may be more limited in the amount of dividends our insurance subsidiaries can make to apcapital 
our geographic concentration in certain midwestern states and new mexico ties our performance to the business  economic  regulatory and legislative conditions in those states 
approximately of our total medical professional liability direct premiums written in was written in the states of illinois  michigan  ohio  kentucky and new mexico 
because of this concentration  unfavorable business  economic or regulatory conditions in these states could adversely impact the amount of premiums we are able to write  the costs associated with loss settlement and other expenses 
an interruption or change in current marketing and agency relationships could reduce the amount of premium we are able to write 
we currently carry the endorsement of the michigan state medical society and other such organizations  which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 
if the endorsement of these organizations were to lapse  we could see a reduction in our premium volumes in markets where such organizations carry influence 
in addition  approximately of our medical professional liability direct premiums written are produced by agencies 
one agency in particular  the scw agency group  inc  produced approximately of our medical professional direct premiums written during an interruption or change in the relationship with any of these agencies could adversely and materially impact the amount of premiums we are able to write 
a downgrade in the financial strength rating of our insurance subsidiaries could reduce the amount of business we are able to write 
rating agencies  such as am best company  rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of a company s ability to meet policyholder obligations 
our primary insurance subsidiary  american physicians  has an am best rating of b very good 
an insurance company s rating  and in particular its am best rating  can be a potential source of competitive advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace 
accordingly  a downgrade in our am best rating could adversely affect our position in the marketplace and could result in a reduction in the amount of business we are able to write 
changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operation  cash flows and financial condition 
a significant portion of our assets are invested in interest bearing fixed income securities 
in recent years  we have earned our investment income primarily from interest income on these investments 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates could reduce the return on our investment portfolio  if we must reinvest the proceeds of securities that mature at rates below those of the securities that mature 
the reduced investment income could also reduce our cash flows 
conversely  an increase in interest rates would reduce the carrying value of our available for sale fixed income securities as the market value of these securities is typically inversely related to interest rates  which could result in a charge to income if determined to be other than temporary 
an increase in short term interest rates would also increase the interest payments associated with our long term debt as those obligations pay a variable rate of interest that is in part based on the three month london inter bank offered rate 
any of these consequences may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and assets  including the amount of net unrealized appreciation on investments shown on our balance sheet date 
our status as an insurance holding company with no direct operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and fund future share repurchases 
apcapital is an insurance holding company 
as such  it has no ongoing operations and its primary assets are the stock of its insurance subsidiaries 
the availability of cash needed by apcapital to meet its obligations on its outstanding debt  repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and pay its operating expenses is largely dependent upon dividends that it receives from its insurance subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by state insurance laws  which restrict the amount of dividends that can be made without prior approval by the state of michigan insurance commissioner 
applicable law and various provisions in our articles and bylaws will prevent and discourage unsolicited attempts to acquire apcapital that you may believe are in your best interests or that might result in a substantial profit to you 
apcapital is subject to provisions of michigan corporate and insurance laws that have the effect of impeding a change of control by requiring prior approval of a change of control transaction by the ofis and the board of directors 
in addition  apcapital s articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions which allow for the issuance of blank check preferred stock without further shareholder approval  set high vote requirements for certain amendments to the articles of incorporation and bylaws  establish a staggered board  limit the ability of shareholders to call special meetings  and require unanimity for shareholder action taken without a meeting 
these provisions may discourage a takeover attempt that you consider to be in your best interests or in which you would receive a substantial premium over the then current market price 
in addition  approval by the ofis of a change of control transaction may be withheld even if the transaction would be in the shareholders best interest if it determines that the transaction would be detrimental to policyholders 
as a result you may not have an opportunity to participate in such a transaction

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the discussion that follows contains certain forward looking statements relating to our anticipated future financial condition  operating results  cash flows and our current business plans 
when we use words such as will  should  believes  expects  anticipates  estimates or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this report 
while we believe any forward looking statements we have made are reasonable  actual results could differ materially since the statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties are detailed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report and from time to time in other reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the cross referenced information is incorporated herein by reference 
overview as a property and casualty insurer  our results of operations are primarily driven by our underwriting results  which are measured by subtracting incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses from net premiums earned 
while our underwriting gain loss is a key performance indicator of our operations  it is not uncommon for a property and casualty insurer to generate an underwriting loss  yet earn a profit overall  because of the availability of investment income to offset the underwriting loss 
an insurance company earns investment income on what is commonly referred to as the float 
the float is money that we hold  in the form of investments  from premiums that we have collected 
while a substantial portion of the premiums we collect will ultimately be used to make claim payments and to pay for claims adjustment expenses  the period of time that we hold the float prior to paying losses can extend over several years  especially with a long tailed line of business such as medical professional liability 
the key factors that determine the amount of investment income we are able to generate are the rate of return  or yield  on invested assets and the length of time we are able to hold the float 
our medical professional liability insurance business is discussed in detail in item business medical professional liability operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
adjustments related to changes in estimates are reflected in the company s earnings in the period those estimates changed 
the following policies are those we believe to be the most sensitive to estimates and judgments or involve revenue recognition 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses our consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our various insurance lines of business 
our actuaries utilize standard actuarial techniques to project ultimate losses based on our paid and incurred loss information and claim count  as well as industry data 
these projections are prepared using the company s data  including the number of claims reported and paid  and the average severity of reported and paid claims  as well as industry data 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
based on these quantitative as well as other qualitative factors  such as a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and the current reserving practices of the company s claims department  we select a best estimate of ultimate future losses  and then record this best estimate in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as required by insurance regulatory authorities  we receive an annual statement of opinion by an independent consulting actuary concerning the adequacy of our reserves 
when a claim is reported to us  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the process of estimating the reserves reflects an informed judgement based upon insurance reserving practices appropriate for the relevant line of business and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator regarding the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the variables considered include the effects of ultimate loss payments of internal factors such as claims handling practices and changes in the mix of our products  as well as external factors such as changes in loss severity trends  economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative and regulatory changes 
case reserves are periodically adjusted by the claims staff  as more information becomes available 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process and does not represent an exact calculation of that liability 
we maintain reserves for claims incurred but not reported  commonly referred to as ibnr  to provide for future reporting of already incurred claims and developments on reported claims 
the reserve for ibnr claims is determined based on historical loss trends 
as it often takes several years for medical professional liability claims to be resolved three to six years on average from the time the loss is reported the ultimate payment can be difficult to project due to typical delays in reporting claims to us  the often lengthy discovery process  and the time necessary to defend the claim 
in addition  changes in our case reserving philosophy can introduce additional uncertainty into the actuarial estimation process 
further  claims with similar characteristics may result in very different ultimate losses depending on the state or region where the claim occurred 
all of these factors contribute to the variability in estimating ultimate loss payments  especially since the effects of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified on a prospective basis 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  as future trends related to the frequency and severity of claims  and other factors  may develop differently than management has projected 
the assumptions and methodologies used in estimating and establishing the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected as income or expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
historically  such adjustments have not exceeded of our recorded net reserves as of the beginning of the period  but they can materially and adversely affect our results of operations when an adjustment is made 
due to the current volatility of losses in the medical professional liability industry  adjustments have occurred in each of the last several years 
with the exception of reserves for extended reporting period claims discussed below  we do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money 
investments on a periodic basis  the company reviews its fixed income and equity security portfolio for proper classification as trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
in  the company concluded that it had both the intent and ability to hold a significant portion of the company s fixed income securities to maturity 
accordingly  the company transferred fixed income securities  with an estimated fair value of approximately million at the date of transfer  from the available for sale category to the held to maturity category 
the remainder of the company s fixed income security portfolio  as well as its equity securities held for investment  remains in the available for sale category 
the company accounted for the transfer of these fixed income securities from the available for sale to the held to maturity category at the estimated fair value of the securities at the date of transfer 
any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  at the date of transfer continue to be reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and in effect will be amortized over the remaining life of the security through other comprehensive income 
the original premium or discount will continue to be amortized as an adjustment to yield as a component of investment income 
available for sale fixed income and equity securities are reported at their estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses reported net of any related tax effects  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any change in the estimated fair value of available for sale investment securities during the period is reported as unrealized appreciation or depreciation  net of any related tax effects  in other comprehensive income 
investment income includes amortization of premium and accrual of discount on the yield to maturity method relating to investments acquired at other than par value 
the fair value of fixed maturity securities is based on market quotations provided to us by our third party custodian who engages independent third party pricing sources that use valuation models 
the valuation models used by the independent third party pricing sources use indicative information such as ratings  industry  coupon  and maturity along with publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads  and the ultimate fair value of the non publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
real estate is carried at the lesser of historical cost  less accumulated depreciation or estimated fair value as determined by recent appraisals  offers from prospective independent third party buyers  or the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the property 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
investments which are considered to be other than temporarily impaired  or otti  are written down to their estimated net realizable value as of the end of the period in which the otti was noted 
subsequent recoveries in the fair value of impaired securities are not reported in income  but rather as unrealized gains  net of tax  in comprehensive income 
inherent in our evaluation of a particular security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer  and its future liquidity and earnings potential 
some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in market value is other than temporary are our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the recoverability of principal and interest related to the security  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities  or amortized cost for fixed maturity securities  the financial condition  near term and long term earnings and cash flow prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions that could affect access to liquidity 
during the year ended december   there were no investment securities whose decline was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
reserve for extended reporting period claims a portion of the coverage that physicians purchase under claims made policies is for an additional death  disability and retirement  or ddr  insurance benefit 
this ddr coverage provides coverage to the physician for any prior incidents occurring during the coverage period that are reported after their death  disability or retirement 
the loss exposure associated with this product is known as extended reporting period claims 
the reserve for extended reporting period claims coverage is recorded during the term of the original claims made policy  based on the present value of future estimated benefits  including morbidity and mortality assumptions  less the present value of expected future premiums associated with this ddr coverage 
the reserves for these claims fluctuate based on the number of physicians who are eligible for this coverage and their age 
any changes in the ddr reserves are reflected as an expense in the period in which we become aware that an adjustment is necessary 
at december  and  our recorded ddr reserves were million and million  respectively  which include a discount related to the present value calculation of approximately million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition insurance premium income is generally recognized on a daily pro rata basis over the respective terms of the policies in force which is generally one year 
certain extended reporting endorsements  often referred to as tail coverage  allow extended reporting of insured events after the termination of the original claims made policy by modifying the exposure period of the underlying contract 
tail coverage can modify the exposure period for a definite or indefinite period 
premiums associated with tail policies that provide coverage for a definite period are earned over the period additional coverage is provided using the daily pro rata method 
premiums for tail policies that provide additional coverage for an indefinite period are fully earned at the date of issuance 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
reinsurance reinsurance premiums and losses related to reinsured business are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premium income 
reinsured losses incurred are reported as a reduction of gross losses incurred 
under our primary professional liability reinsurance contract  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers is swing rated  or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated contract is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
we pay a provisional premium during the initial policy year 
a liability is recorded to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
to the extent that our estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses changes  the amount of swing rated reinsurance premiums may also change 
we annually review the financial stability of all of our reinsurers 
this review includes a ratings analysis of each reinsurer participating in a reinsurance contract 
at december   there are no known issues with the financial solvency of our reinsurers or their ultimate ability to pay amounts due to us 
our reinsurance arrangements are discussed in more detail in item business medical professional liability operations and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
income taxes deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the difference between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a determination must be made for deferred tax assets regarding whether it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will exist in future periods when deductible temporary differences are expected to reverse to enable the company to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not exist  a valuation allowance should be recorded for the portion of deferred tax assets the company likely will not realize 
in  we had determined that there was not sufficient positive evidence to support the realization of the future tax benefit and established a valuation allowance for the entire million net deferred tax asset as of september  however  during we generated pre tax income of million 
this combined with the million of pre tax income from led to management s conclusion that it was more likely than not that sufficient taxable income would exist in future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets 
accordingly  during  we reversed the entire deferred tax valuation allowance 
changes in the valuation allowance during and were allocated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to federal income taxes a component of net income  other comprehensive income  or other components of shareholders equity  depending on the nature of the deferred item that gave rise to the change 
the establishment of the valuation allowance in was all recorded as federal income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  included elsewhere in this report 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the deferred tax valuation allowance and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
we record any windfall tax benefits related to employee share based awards as a credit to additional paid in capital in the year that they are currently deductible in the company s consolidated tax return 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  are those costs that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new  or renewal  business and include such costs as commissions  premium taxes and other costs incurred in connection with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
under gaap  the premiums that will be earned in future periods  to which these deferred costs relate  must produce sufficient profits to offset the future expense that will be recognized from the amortization of the dac  that is  the dac must be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of dac  we have made certain assumptions regarding the future amount and timing of costs associated with the business written  such as costs to maintain the policies and the ultimate projected loss and loss adjustment expense payments associated with these policies 
in addition  we have considered future investment income  at an assumed yield  in determining the recoverability of dac 
based on our analysis as of december   the dac carried on the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  of million  was deemed to be fully recoverable 
description of ratios analyzed in the analysis of our operating results that follows  we refer to various financial ratios that management uses to analyze and compare the underwriting results of our insurance operations 
these ratios are calculated on a gaap basis and include loss ratio this ratio compares our losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  net of reinsurance  to our net premiums earned  and indicates how much we expect to pay policyholders for claims and related settlement expenses compared to the amount of premiums we earn 
the calendar year loss ratio uses all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current calendar year ie  related to all accident years 
the accident year loss ratio uses only those loss and loss adjustment expenses that relate to the current accident year ie  excludes the effect of development on prior year loss reserves 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is  all other things being equal 
underwriting expense ratio this ratio compares our expenses to obtain new business and renew existing business  plus normal operating expenses  to our net premiums earned 
the ratio is used to measure how efficient we are at obtaining business and operating the insurance segments 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are  all else being equal 
sometimes  however  a higher underwriting expense ratio can result in better business as more rigorous risk management and underwriting procedures may result in the non renewal of higher risk accounts  which can in turn improve our loss ratio  and overall profitability 
combined ratio this ratio equals the sum of our loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is 
this ratio excludes the effects of investment income 
the statutory ratios will differ from gaap ratios as a result of differences in accounting between the statutory basis of accounting and gaap 
additionally  the denominator for the underwriting expense ratio for gaap is net premiums earned  compared to net premiums written for the statutory underwriting expense ratio

the underwriting results of our medical professional liability and other insurance lines segments are discussed in greater detail in the sections that follow 
the decrease in investment income for the year ended december  compared to the same period of was due to a variety of reasons 
first  investment income in benefited from call premiums of approximately million as a result of tender offers made by the issuer of bonds held in our portfolio 
also  we began to liquidate our high yield bond portfolio late in the first quarter of  and completed the disposition of all such bonds by the end of the third quarter of the proceeds from the liquidation of the high yield bond portfolio were held in cash and cash equivalents  which was another factor contributing to the decrease in investment income from to we have maintained a large cash position in due to uncertainty regarding future changes in long term interest rates 
however  we anticipate that a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalent resources will be redeployed into longer term tax exempt securities sometime in  which will reduce our future effective tax rate 
the change in fair value of certain investment securities that management has determined contain embedded derivative financial instruments is also included in investment income 
as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  the estimated fair value of these securities decreased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to decreases of  for the same period of these securities were sold in late and will have no impact on our reported investment income in future periods 
as a result of the changes in the mix of our investment portfolio  the decrease in call premiums in compared to and the losses on derivative securities discussed above  the overall annual yield on our investment portfolio decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we believe that the yield earned in is more representative of what we anticipate earning in future periods as a result of the realignment of the portfolio 
the net realized gain reported for the year ended december  was primarily the result of a one time recovery of million in cash related to securities that had been written off in previous years 
this amount was offset by approximately  of impairment charges and the subsequent realized loss related the sale of our last physician office building investment real estate property in we continue to own other development property located in east lansing  michigan 
it is our intention to sell these properties over the next several years 
we do not anticipate any losses related to the ultimate sales of the east lansing properties 
in general  when evaluating or projecting our results of operations  management typically does not include realized gains or losses  as many of the factors that contribute to the generation of these gains and losses are beyond our control 
the decrease in investment expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation expense in as a result of the sale of our grand rapids real estate properties  which began in the third quarter of we anticipate investment expense will remain at or slightly below that reported in the increase in interest expense was the result of an increase in short term interest rates 
our long term debt of million pays an average variable rate of interest of plus the three month london inter bank offered rate  or libor 
if the three month libor continues to increase  our interest expense will also increase  however  the annual rate of interest on the debentures is capped at through may amortization expense in consists of  of amortization related to a two year covenant not to compete and  of amortization for debt issue costs 
the covenant not to compete was fully amortized as of december  amortization expense in future periods should consist of only the amortization of debt issue costs  which should approximately  annually through and approximately  in the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily the result of unusually high costs incurred in in connection with the board of directors exploration of strategic alternatives  as well as audit and other professional service fees incurred in connection with the initial assessment and opinions on the company s internal controls required under the sarbanes oxley act 
we believe that general and administrative expenses incurred during are more representative of costs expected to be incurred in future periods 
other expenses relate to employee separation costs and contract termination costs incurred in connection with our exit from the workers compensation line of business as well as the sub lease of office space in chicago  illinois 
we anticipate that these costs should be minimal in future periods as all available office space has been subleased and there remain only a handful of workers compensation employees 
for further information relating to the costs associated with the exit of our workers compensation line of business  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
federal income taxes do not bear the usual relationship to pre tax income for the year ended december  as a result of the effect of the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
in the second quarter of  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance  and based on our recent results of operations  concluded that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary 
the reversal of the valuation allowance is the primary reason for the unusually large federal income tax benefit reported for see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for further information regarding federal income taxes 
such cross referenced information is incorporated herein by reference 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately in future periods 
compared to the net income reported for was primarily attributable to the continued improvements in the underwriting performance ie underwriting gain of our medical professional liability segment combined with increased investment income over the prior year 
partially offsetting these positive factors were increases in the underwriting losses of the other insurance lines segment  which were primarily attributable to the run off of the workers compensation and health lines of insurance  and increases in general and administrative expenses 
the net loss reported in was the result of the unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves  primarily related to our medical professional liability segment  and an increase in paid loss severity noted during the third quarter  particularly in our florida  ohio and kentucky markets 
in connection with the loss reported in the third quarter of as a result of the unfavorable development on prior year s medical professional liability loss reserves  we also established a deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
the underwriting results of our medical professional liability and other insurance lines segments are discussed in greater detail in the sections that follow 
the discussion below focuses on those aspects of our operations that are not specific to the insurance segments 
the increase in investment income was the result of strong returns on our high yield bond portfolio during the first part of the year  one time call premiums of million and a decrease in the percentage of our investment portfolio allocated to short term investments 
although we began to liquidate our high yield bond portfolio at the end of the first quarter of  the overall yield on our investment portfolio was for compared to for  primarily as the result of strong returns on our collateralized mortgage obligations in the decrease in investment expenses is primarily related to the liquidation of our high yield portfolio during the first half of and the absence of depreciation for a portion of the year as a result of the sale of some of our physician office building investment real estate properties 
the remaining office buildings were sold in and investment expenses for that year are more representative of what we anticipate incurring in future periods 
the increase in amortization expense during relates to an intangible asset arising from a two year covenant not to compete with the company s former ceo and president upon his retirement effective december  general and administrative expenses increased during compared to  primarily due to increased legal  audit and other professional fees incurred as a result of actions taken to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and related sec requirements and the exploration of strategic alternatives by the board of directors 
other expenses for consist primarily of contract termination costs incurred in connection with the sub lease of approximately  square feet of office space in chicago  illinois 
other expenses for were primarily related to employee separation costs as a result of terminations in connection with our exit from the workers compensation line of business 
the decrease in federal income tax expense in was the result of the establishment of the deferred tax valuation allowance in because of the impact of the valuation allowance neither the federal income tax benefit for or the tax expense for are representative of the expense anticipated in future periods 
medical professional liability insurance operations the following table sets forth summary premium  loss and expense information regarding the underwriting results of our medical professional liability insurance operations for the years ended december   and percentage percentage change change change change dollars in thousands direct premiums written michigan illinois ohio new mexico kentucky florida florida pic nevada other total net premiums written net premiums earned incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses current accident year losses gerling global commutation prior year losses total underwriting expenses underwriting income loss income loss before federal income taxes and minority interest loss ratio accident year gerling global commutation prior years calendar year underwriting expense ratio combined ratio compared to direct premiums written for the medical professional liability segment decreased in primarily as a result of exiting the nevada and florida markets  discontinuing the alternative risk program and non renewing a large hospital account due to underwriting considerations 
in addition  premiums decreased from due to a change in the composition of our book of business in ohio and kentucky  as we reduced exposures in higher risk geographic markets and specialties in those states 
our insured physician count at december  was  a decrease of from december  the decline in insured physicians was the result of the reasons discussed above as well as increased price competition in selected markets 
our retention ratio  the ratio of previously insured physicians compared to the number of physicians that we renew  was in  compared with in despite increasing pricing pressure in the medical professional liability market  we remain committed to our strategy of adequate pricing and strict underwriting 
this strategy may result in the loss of additional policyholders 
however  we are not willing to compromise our standards  or profitability  for the sake of market share 
premium rate increases have ranged from to by state in  except in kentucky where we increased rates 
the average premium per policy in force has increased from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   an increase of 
although we began our exit from the florida market in december and our premiums written in that state have declined significantly  we continue to have direct premiums written in that state as a result of installment premiums on extended reporting coverage  which we were required by florida state law to offer insureds as we non renewed their policies 
the premiums for these policies may be paid in annual installments  not to exceed three years 
accordingly  with the exception of premiums related to pic fl  we should not have any premium writings in florida after direct premiums written by pic fl in the state of florida increased  during  to million compared to million during our investment in and consolidation of pic fl is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
we anticipate that medical professional liability direct premiums written will increase moderately in the future as the company is granted additional rate increases by regulatory authorities 
however  we do not expect that rate increases in will be as significant as those taken in recent years 
the decrease in net premiums written is consistent with the decrease in direct premiums written 
net premiums earned  however  did not decrease as much as direct and net premiums written as we continue to earn in the higher premium volume written in during we retained a participation in our primary excess of loss reinsurance layer  which covered the first  of risk exposure in excess of  we retained no loss exposure for losses in excess of million related to policies written during effective january  we combined the two treaties so that loss exposures greater than  in all markets except michigan  were ceded under one treaty 
we retained a participation in this treaty 
for business written in michigan  we retained of the first million of loss exposure  and of losses in excess of million 
these changes in our reinsurance program did not have a significant impact on the amount of premium ceded under the contracts  as the net written premium to direct written premium ratio was in compared to in while these changes are not anticipated to have a material effect on our net loss and loss adjustment expenses  the ultimate impact on our loss experience will not be known for several years 
under our reinsurance treaties we will continue to retain of the first  of loss exposure and will retain a participation in the exposure layer of million in excess of  in all states except new mexico and indiana where state patients compensation funds limit our loss exposure to  and  respectively 
as a result of these terms  we anticipate that the percentage of our direct premiums written ceded to reinsurers to decrease from approximately in to in we believe that this layer of business is profitable 
however  the ultimate impact of these changes in our reinsurance treaty on net income will depend upon future underwriting results 
the decrease in loss and loss adjustment expenses and the loss ratio from to is primarily the result of our efforts over the last few years to re underwrite risks in all markets combined with premium rate increases taken over the last several years 
the re underwriting efforts have resulted in a decrease in both the frequency and severity of reported and paid losses 
as the trends of decreasing frequency and severity are now beginning to emerge in the loss data used to make actuarial projections of ultimate losses  we have adjusted downward our estimate of ultimate losses related to the and prior accident years by approximately million 
this favorable development was especially prevalent in our ohio and michigan markets 
the adequacy of our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is explained in greater depth under financial condition 
the loss ratio has steadily declined over the last several years 
however  we believe that this trend will level off as a result of smaller rate increases in the future and a more stable book of business 
compared to direct premiums written for the medical professional liability segment increased in as we continued to implement rate increases in all markets and increased our market share in new mexico 
this was partially offset by our reduced exposure in the florida market  as well as ohio and kentucky where we reduced exposures in higher risk geographic markets and specialties and discontinued offering occurrence based policies 
our insured physician count at december  decreased approximately from december  this decline was the result of the reasons indicated above  as well as a decrease in the number of insured physicians in illinois where we took a significant rate increase effective april  the average premium per policy in force increased to approximately  at december  from approximately  at december   an increase of 
approximately million of the total million increase in direct premiums written was attributable to pic fl  which completed its first full year of operations in pic fl is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our net premiums written and earned during increased a greater percentage than direct premiums written as effective january  we began retaining a participation in our primary excess of loss reinsurance layer 
this increase in net written premiums also resulted in the larger percentage increase in net earned premiums 
the decrease in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses was primarily the result of million of adverse development on prior year loss and loss adjustment expense reserves recorded in compared with million of favorable development  net of million of unfavorable development related to the reinsurance commutation with gerling global 
on an accident year basis  the loss ratio was compared to for the accident year 
the decrease in the accident year loss ratio was primarily the result of rate increases in all markets  the exit from the florida market and certain occurrence based markets and stricter underwriting standards 
the increase in underwriting expenses is primarily attributable to the increase in premium volume 
however  a portion is attributable to the absorption of more management and other fixed costs as a result of our exit from our other insurance lines of business 
other insurance lines operations the following table sets forth summary premium  loss and expense information regarding the underwriting results of our other insurance lines operations for the years ended december   and percentage percentage change change change change dollars in thousands direct premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses current accident year losses gerling global commutation prior year losses total underwriting expenses underwriting loss income loss before federal income taxes and minority interest loss ratio accident year gerling global commutation prior years calendar year underwriting expense ratio combined ratio compared to the direct premiums written for other insurance lines decreased during as we continued our exit from the workers compensation and health lines of business 
as of june   all workers compensation and health policies had expired 
incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in exposure associated with the reduced number of covered lives in our health line  and the number of policies in force for workers compensation 
the decreases in prior year loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred were primarily the result of the stabilization of workers compensation reserves 
workers compensation is a long tailed line of business  meaning that it may be several years from the date a claim is reported to us until the claim is ultimately settled 
however  as claims age  the ultimate amount of exposure with regard to a claim often becomes more clear 
as a result  volatility inherent in the actuarial projection of ultimate losses begins to stabilize  reducing the need to adjust loss reserves for previous accident years 
there remain approximately open workers compensation claims at december   down from  at december  we believe that the reserve for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses as of december  is adequate 
however  due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate cost of claims settlement will not exceed the reserves we have established  as future claims patterns may emerge differently than the assumptions utilized in our estimates 
the decrease in underwriting expenses is primarily the result of a decrease in corporate and shared services salary  employee benefit and other costs allocated to the other insurance lines segment as a result of the decreased premium volume 
compared to the direct premiums written for other insurance lines decreased during as we continued our exit from the workers compensation and health lines of business 
the decreases in net premiums written were relatively consistent with the decreases in direct premiums written 
net premiums earned  however  did not decrease as much as direct and net premiums written  as premiums associated with workers compensation policies written in continued to be earned in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in exposure associated with the reduced number of covered lives in our health line  and the number of policies in force for workers compensation 
the decrease in underwriting expenses was primarily the result of reduced salary and employee benefit costs as a result of the departure of the other insurance management team in the last nine months of  as well as a decrease in corporate and shared services salary  employee benefit and other costs allocated to the other insurance lines segment as a result of the decreased premium volume 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity  on both a short and long term basis  are funds provided by insurance premiums collected  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
we also enter into financing transactions from time to time to acquire additional capital 
the primary uses of cash  on both a short and long term basis  are losses  loss adjustment expenses  operating expenses  the acquisition of invested assets and fixed assets  reinsurance premiums  interest payments  taxes  and the repurchase of apcapital stock 
apcapital s only material assets are the capital stock of american physicians and its other subsidiaries  cash obtained from the proceeds from its junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures  or debentures  issued in  and dividends from its subsidiaries 
apcapital s ongoing cash flow will consist primarily of dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries and investment earnings on funds held 
in  american physicians paid cash dividends of million to apcapital 
the amount of dividends that apcapital s insurance subsidiaries can pay to apcapital in any month period is limited to the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year  excluding net realized gains losses on the sale of investments  or of statutory surplus as of the preceding year end 
accordingly  as of january   approximately million could be paid by the apcapital s insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
apcapital s primary uses of cash  on both a short and long term bases include periodic interest payments  operating expenses  the repurchase of its outstanding common shares and the repayment of the debentures 
apcapital s cash and cash equivalent resources totaled approximately million at december  at december   we had no material planned expenditures for the acquisition of assets  or other expenditures  other than expenses incurred in the normal course of operations 
as of september   american physicians entered into a stock purchase agreement with various shareholders of physicians insurance company of wisconsin  inc  or picw  to acquire a substantial minority interest in picw 
the stock purchase agreement  as amended in november  stated that american physicians will purchase  shares of picw common stock at a purchase price of  per share in cash  or approximately million 
on august   american physicians terminated the stock purchase agreement 
concurrently with the termination  american physicians withdrew its form a application pending before the office of the commissioner of insurance of wisconsin oci to acquire the interest in picw 
however  following the termination of the stock purchase agreement  american physicians purchased from some of the same shareholders a total of  shares of picw common stock  representing of picw s outstanding shares of common stock 
the purchase price was  per share  or approximately million 
in addition  approximately  of costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were capitalized  bringing the total cost of the investment to million 
the purchase of the  shares was disputed by the oci and picw 
on december   proassurance corporation filed a plan to acquire all the outstanding shares of the common stock of picw 
the oci thereafter entered a stay of proceeding relating to american physicians acquisition of  shares until the proassurance corporation transaction is either approved or disapproved  and until the conclusion of a reasonable time period for closing that transaction 
from time to time  the board of directors authorizes the company to purchase shares of its outstanding common stock 
on november   the board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional five percent of the company s outstanding common shares 
this resulted in an authorization to repurchase an additional  shares  bringing the total number of shares authorized to be repurchased under publicly announced plans to in  we repurchased  shares at a cost of million  bringing the total number of shares purchased pursuant to these plans to  at a total cost of million  or an average price per share of 
in  we did not repurchase any shares pursuant to this plan 
our repurchase of shares is subject to limitations that may be imposed by applicable laws and regulations and the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
the timing of the purchases and the number of shares to be bought at any one time depend on market conditions and the company s capital requirements 
as of december   there are approximately  shares of the november  stock repurchase program remaining to be purchased 
we continually evaluate the benefits of repurchasing our shares 
our net cash flow provided by operations was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million provided by operations in and million in cash generated by operations principally consists of premiums received  net of reinsurance  in excess of net paid loss and loss adjustment expenses as shown in the table below 
year ended december  premiums received  net of reinsurance net paid loss and loss adjustment expenses net premiums received in excess of loss payments additional cash was provided in and by investment returns and reduced expenses 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of available for sale fixed income securities to meet short term cash flow needs 
on a long term basis  fixed income securities are purchased on a basis intended to provide adequate cash flows from future maturities to meet future policyholder obligations and ongoing operational expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million  million and million of held to maturity fixed income securities that mature in the next one to five years  five to ten years and more than ten years  respectively 
we also have approximately million of mortgage backed securities that provide periodic principal repayments 
subsequent to december   we have purchased approximately million of tax exempt municipal bonds and million of government agency fixed income securities 
we anticipate that over the next three to six months  we will deploy more of our cash resources to various other securities  including tax exempt municipals  investment grade corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the anticipated maturities of our fixed income securities 
based on historical trends  market conditions and our current business plans  we believe that our existing resources and sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our short and long term liquidity needs 
however  economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  and there can be no assurance that our funds will be sufficient to meet these liquidity needs 
financial condition in evaluating our financial condition  two factors are the most critical 
first  the availability of adequate statutory capital and surplus to satisfy state regulators and to support our current am best rating  and second  the adequacy of our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
statutory capital and surplus our statutory capital and surplus  which we refer to collectively as surplus  at december  was approximately million 
this results in a net premiums written to surplus ratio of

such cross referenced information is incorporated herein by reference 
the favorable development reflected for the medical professional liability segment is the result of positive trends in both the frequency and severity of reported and paid losses related primarily to the and accident years  especially in our ohio and michigan markets 
these positive trends are the result of the more stringent underwriting standards we have put in place over the last few years  and our efforts to discontinue writing higher risk specialties and in higher risk geographic markets 
although these underwriting changes have taken place over the last few years  management has been cautiously optimistic in reflecting their impact in our actuarial analyses of the original reserve estimates at december  and however  more recent data suggests that the changes in our underwriting practices have reduced both the number of reported claims and the severity of paid claims  which has caused us to revise our original reserve estimates downward for the and accident years 
the unfavorable development associated with prior accident years in the other insurance lines is primarily related to the workers compensation line of business 
prior year development  both favorable and unfavorable  is relatively common for lines that are in run off  as the actual loss patterns that emerge as claims are run off often differ from what the historical data would predict 
this occurs because claims that are settled as the line runs off are often less severe in nature than those that remain open 
in addition  as the number of open claims diminishes  the predictive nature of actuarial models becomes less precise because of their reliance  in part  on historical averages of claims and payment statistics 
while the run off of our workers compensation claims continues to add an element of variability to the already inherently variable process of reserve estimation  we believe that in the second half of  our workers compensation reserves began to stabilize 
accordingly  while prior year development will continue to occur as we run this line off  we do not anticipate that such development will be as significant as that noted during and the following table shows the development of the net liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses from through the top line of the table shows the original estimated liabilities at the balance sheet date  including losses incurred but not yet reported 
the upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts subsequently paid as of successive year ends with respect to the liability 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimates change as claims settle and more information becomes known about the ultimate frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the deficiency or redundancy exists when the re estimated liability at each december is greater or less than the prior liability estimate 
the cumulative deficiency or redundancy depicted in the table  for any particular calendar year  represents the aggregate change in the initial estimates over all subsequent calendar years 
the volatility of professional liability claim frequency and severity makes the prediction of the ultimate loss very difficult 
likewise  the long time frame for professional liability claims to develop and be paid further complicates the reserving process 
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoverable cumulative net paid as of end of year two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later re estimated net liability as of end of year two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later net cumulative deficiency redundancy gross liability end of year reinsurance recoverables net liability end of year gross re estimated liability latest re estimated reinsurance recoverables latest net re estimated liability latest gross cumulative deficiency redundancy during  the gerling global reinsurance corporation gerling commuted their reinsurance contracts with apcapital 
the transaction produced a net loss of million on prior years reserves as a result of apcapital reassuming gerling s obligation for loss and lae in return for consideration which was discounted for the time value of money 
for illustrative purposes  the following cumulative deficiency redundancy amounts exclude the effect of prior year development due to the gerling commutation net cumulative deficiency redundancy excluding gerling commutation during  the company realized million of favorable development on reserves established as of december  the favorable development was the result of million favorable development in professional liability offset with million adverse development in other lines 
the favorable development in professional liability was the result of fewer than expected reported claims and lower indemnity claim costs on the and accident years  particularly in the ohio and michigan markets 
the adverse development in other lines arose primarily from workers compensation in the first half of  partially offset by favorable development in the company s accident and health business 
in evaluating the information in the table above  it should be noted that each column includes the effects of changes in amounts for prior periods 
the table does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
reserve ranges in an effort to better explain the inherent uncertainty in our net loss and lae reserves  we have developed a reasonable range of estimates around the net carried reserves 
our ranges in the table below were primarily established by reviewing the various actuarial methods  discussed under critical accounting policies  used to estimate net loss and lae reserves 
net loss and lae reserves low end recorded high end of range reserves of range in thousands medical professional liability other insurance lines total there are several limitations to interpreting reserve ranges which apply in this situation 
the totals in the above table do not necessarily have the same probabilities as the individual ranges by segment as the segments themselves may not be independent 
for example  if workers compensation medical loss costs increase at a rate greater than expected  professional liability loss costs  of which a component is the cost of medical care  may also increase 
there are also macroeconomic effects that may cause professional liability loss costs to increase at a more rapid rate due to the prospect of tort reform  which likely will have little or no impact on workers compensation loss costs 
other macroeconomic effects which may have differing effects by segment include  but are not limited to  changes in the litigiousness of jurisdictions in which we write business  changes in unemployment rates by geographic location  the influence of legislative actions  and changes in political philosophy 
as a result of these factors  as well as other unknown factors  there can be no assurance that reserves will develop within these ranges 
the likelihood of reserves emerging differently than the carried reserves diminish as you approach the low and high end of the ranges 
however it is meaningful to note the potential variability in the company s net income before the effect of income taxes if reserves develop to either the low or high end 
the following table shows the effects on pre tax net income if the carried reserves as of december  actually prove to be at the low or high end of the range increase decrease in pre tax income in thousands low end of range high end of range due to the long tailed nature of the medical professional liability and workers compensation lines of insurance  changes in the actuarially projected ultimate loss severity can have an even greater impact on the balance of recorded reserves than with most other property and casualty insurance lines 
while we believe that our estimate for ultimate projected losses related to our medical professional liability and workers compensa tion lines of business are adequate based on our open and reported claim counts  there can be no assurance that additional significant reserve enhancements will not be necessary in the future given the many variables inherent in such estimates and the extended period of time that it can take for claim patterns to emerge 
other significant balance sheet items premiums receivable decreased million  or  to million at december  this decrease is relatively consistent with the decrease in medical professional liability direct premiums written 
reinsurance recoverables increased million  or  to million at december  reinsurance recoverables  on a gaap basis  represent reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded under the various reinsurance treaties we have in place  as well as receivables from reinsurers for loss payments we have made and are entitled to recover under the terms of the treaties 
this increase is related to an increase in ceded ibnr as actuarial projections indicate an increase in the number and severity of losses above our retention levels under past and current reinsurance treaties 
unearned premiums decreased million  or  to million at december  the decrease is relatively consistent with the decrease in medical professional liability direct premiums written from to  as would be expected 
accrued expenses and other liabilities at december  were million  a decrease of million compared to december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount payable related to pending security transactions  which was million at december  compared to  at december  shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  from million at december  retained earnings increased million as a result of the net income recorded for the year ended december   which included the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
this increase was offset by a decrease of million in additional paid in capital related primarily to the purchase and retirement of the company s common stock 
the company s book value per common share outstanding at december  was per share  based on  shares outstanding  compared to per common share outstanding at december  total shares outstanding at december  were  off balance sheet arrangements in may  we formed two subsidiary statutory trusts for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities  referred to as trust preferred securities 
the proceeds from the trust preferred securities that were issued were used by the trusts to purchase debentures issued by apcapital  which are shown as long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report 
apcapital used the amounts borrowed pursuant to these debentures to increase its available capital and has subsequently contributed substantially all of the proceeds to american physicians to increase its statutory surplus 
the debentures and the trust preferred securities have terms and maturities that mirror each other

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities  which are interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  our primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the majority of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities 
the fixed income securities primarily consisted of us government and agency bonds  high quality corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and tax exempt us municipal bonds 
qualitative information about market risk investments in our portfolio have varying degrees of risk 
the primary market risk exposure associated with our available for sale fixed income security portfolio is interest rate risk  which is limited somewhat by our management of duration 
the distribution of maturities and sector concentrations are monitored on a regular basis 
in addition  our fixed income security portfolio is also subject to a degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the risk that amounts due the company by creditors may not ultimately be collected 
at december   all of our fixed income portfolio  both available for sale and held to maturity  excluding approximately million of private placement issues  which constitutes of our portfolio was considered investment grade 
we define investment grade securities as those that have a standard poors credit rating of bbb and above 
non investment grade securities typically bear more credit risk than those of investment grade quality 
in addition  we try to limit credit risk by not maintaining fixed income security investments pertaining to any one issuer  with the exception of us government and agency backed securities  in excess of million 
we also try to diversify our holdings so that there is not a significant concentration in any one industry or geographical region 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values 
the fair value of publicly traded fixed income securities is based upon independent market quotations 
the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on independent third party pricing sources that use valuation models 
the valuation models used by the independent third party pricing sources use indicative information such as ratings  industry  coupon  and maturity along with publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads  and the ultimate fair value of the non publicly traded fixed income securities 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
our held to maturity portfolio includes approximately million of mortgage backed securities 
because the held to maturity mortgage backed securities are not carried at estimated fair value  changes in interest rates do not affect the carrying amount of these securities 
however  principal receipts as a result of prepayments may affect our cash flows  as an increase in interest rates will slow principal payments  and a decrease in interest rates will accelerate principal payments 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
our policy for recording otti write downs is more fully discussed in item management s discussion and analysis critical accounting policies  investments
