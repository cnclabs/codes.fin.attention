critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility can be reasonably assured 
the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo for approximately of total consolidated inventory of the inventory within the mohawk segment  which matches current costs with current revenues  and the first in  first out method fifo  which is used to value inventory within both the dal tile and unilin segments and inventory not valued under the lifo method in the mohawk segment 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is a function of historical usage and anticipated future selling price  expected sales below cost  excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete  excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets based on management judgments and assumptions using estimated future cash flows 
these judgments and assumptions could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and  therefore  could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the useful life of a definite lived intangible asset is based on assumptions and judgments made by management at the time of acquisition 
changes in these judgments and assumptions that could include a loss of customers  a change in the assessment of future operations or a prolonged economic downturn could materially change the value of the definite lived intangible assets and  therefore  could materially impact the company s financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the company s tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings  as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable  the company consults with its internal experts 
the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it
