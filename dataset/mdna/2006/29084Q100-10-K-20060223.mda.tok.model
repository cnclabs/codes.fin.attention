item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition we are one of the largest mechanical and electrical construction and facilities services firms in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and in the world 
we provide services to a broad range of commercial  industrial  utility and institutional customers through approximately principal operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities 
our offices are located in states and the district of columbia in the united states  six provinces in canada and primary locations in the united kingdom 
in the united arab emirates  we carry on business through two joint ventures 
overview on february   we effected a for stock split in the form of a stock distribution of one common share for each common share owned on the record date of january  the earnings per share data gives effect to the stock split  applied retroactively  to all periods presented 
operating income for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to operating income of million for  on revenues of approximately billion in both periods 
our united states mechanical construction and facilities services  united states facilities services and united kingdom construction and facilities services operating segments each reported increased operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenues operating margin for compared to  the united states electrical construction and facilities services operating segment performed approximately the same as  and the canada construction and facilities services segment reported a smaller operating loss for than for net income for was positively impacted by tax adjustments of million  compared to million of positive tax adjustments for net cash provided by operating activities was million in  a million improvement over primarily as a result of the improvement in net cash provided by operating activities  we reduced borrowings under our working capital credit line to zero at december  compared to million at december  and increased cash and cash equivalents by million to million at december  on september   we disposed of one of our subsidiaries in the united states facilities services segment 
consequently  results of operations for all prior periods reflect discontinued operations accounting 
included in the results of discontinued operations for is a loss of million  net of income tax  by reason of the sale of the subsidiary 
we will not have any future involvement with this subsidiary 
net income and diluted earnings per share for compared to were positively impacted by a generally improved performance on united states and united kingdom construction contracts  b greater availability of generally higher margin discretionary project work in the united states and united kingdom  c favorable income tax adjustments of million  d the settlement of an insurance coverage related dispute which contributed approximately million to operating income  e a generally improved economic environment  particularly for the commercial construction industry and f reduced losses in the canada construction and facilities services segment 
the favorable income tax adjustments of million were comprised of a reversal of million in income tax reserves no longer required  partially offset by a million income tax provision related to a valuation allowance recorded to reduce deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences of our canada construction and facilities services segment 
the valuation allowance was required because there is uncertainty as to whether the segment will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the income tax benefit of such deferred tax assets 
the results for also included favorable income tax adjustments of million see discussion below 
results for were negatively impacted by non cash expenses of million as a result of proceedings in a civil action described below brought against the upper occoquan sewage authority by a joint venture consisting of one of our subsidiaries and an unrelated company 
net income and diluted earnings per share for increased compared to after excluding restructuring expenses of million and a gain on the sale of assets of the united kingdom delcommerce equipment rental services division of million 
positively impacting operating income was increased gross profits from our united kingdom construction and facilities services segment  increased gross profit from united states transportation infrastructure projects and favorable income tax adjustments of million 
the income tax adjustment was comprised of million in income tax reserves no longer required  partially offset by million of income tax provision related to a valuation allowance recorded to reduce deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences in the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment inasmuch as there was uncertainty whether that segment will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the income tax benefit of such deferred tax assets 
these increases were offset by decreased gross profits due to a poor performance on certain construction work  particularly in the united states mechanical construction and facilities services and canada construction and facilities services segments  b continued decreased availability of generally higher margin discretionary small project spending and repair and maintenance work in certain geographical markets in the united states  c heightened price competition for commercial  industrial and public sector work in the united states and d increased prices for certain fixed price construction project materials  particularly in canada 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased compared to primarily due to reduced salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel in all segments 
we also sold our interest in a south african joint venture for a gain of million during a civil action the uosa action was brought by a joint venture the jv between our subsidiary poole kent corporation poole kent and an unrelated company in the fairfax  virginia circuit court based on a material breach by the upper occoquan sewage authority uosa of a construction contract between the jv and uosa 
as a result of a jury decision on march  and a subsequent ruling on june  of the trial judge in the action  it was determined that the jv is entitled to be paid approximately million in connection with the uosa project in addition to the amounts it has already received from uosa 
however  inasmuch as the jury decision and the trial judge s subsequent ruling did not reflect the amount the jv sought in the trial  we recorded a non cash expense of approximately million during the first quarter of following the jury decision on march  and an additional non cash expense of approximately million during the second quarter of following the trial judge s ruling on june  these non cash expenses reflected a write off of unrecovered costs of poole kent in completing certain work related to this project based on what we believe is probable of recovery by the jv based on current facts 
the unrecoverable costs were included in the balance sheet account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the jv has asserted additional claims against uosa relating to the same project which are also pending in the fairfax  virginia circuit court and which could result in another trial between the jv and uosa to be held at a date not yet determined and in which the jv would seek damages in excess of million 
upon the resolution of the additional claims referred to in the immediately preceding sentence  we may record income or additional non cash expense 
in accordance with the joint venture agreement establishing the jv  poole kent is entitled to approximately one half of the aggregate amounts paid and to be paid by uosa to the jv 
the jv and uosa are each seeking to have the determinations in the trial court reversed on appeal to the virginia supreme court 
however  there is no assurance that the virginia supreme court will hear the appeals or  if the appeals are heard  that they will be resolved in favor of the jv 
the and results were also positively affected by the implementation  beginning in  of significant strategic decisions and management changes we initiated 
these actions included the curtailment of work on certain types of public sector projects  replacement of senior management at certain business units and increased focus on reducing selling  general and administrative expenses in all segments 
related to these actions were million and million of restructuring expenses for and  respectively 
the restructuring expenses were primarily related to employee severance obligations 
operating segments we have the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design  integration  installation  startup  operation and maintenance of various systems  a united states electrical construction and facilities services involving systems for generation and distribution of electrical power  lighting systems  low voltage systems such as fire alarm  security  communications and process control systems and voice and data systems  b united states mechanical construction and facilities services involving systems for heating  ventilation  air conditioning  refrigeration and clean room ventilation systems  fire protection systems and plumbing  process and high purity piping systems  c united states facilities services  d canada construction and facilities services  e united kingdom construction and facilities services and f other international construction and facilities services 
the segment united states facilities services principally consists of those operations which provide a portfolio of services needed to support the operation and maintenance of customers facilities mobile operation and maintenance services  site based operation and maintenance services  facility planning and consulting services  energy management programs and the design and construction of energy related projects which services are not related to customers construction programs 
the canada  united kingdom and other international segments perform electrical construction  mechanical construction and facilities services 
other international construction and facilities services represents our operations outside of the united states  canada and the united kingdom currently primarily in the middle east 
in august of  we sold our interest in a south african joint venture 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
there was no adoption of any new accounting policies during we believe that some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations are the impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to a revenue recognition from i long term construction contracts for which the percentage of completion method of accounting is used and ii services contracts  b collectibility or valuation of accounts receivable  c insurance liabilities  d income taxes and e goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue recognition from long term construction contracts and services contracts we believe our most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition from long term construction contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion accounting is the prescribed method of accounting for long term contracts in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and  accordingly  is the method used for revenue recognition within our industry 
percentage of completion for each contract is measured principally by the ratio of costs incurred to date to perform each contract to the estimated total costs to perform such contract at completion 
certain of our electrical contracting business units measure percentage of completion by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date to perform each contract to the estimated total labor costs to perform such contract at completion 
provisions for the entirety of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
application of percentage of completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in our consolidated balance sheets 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers based upon various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of a contract 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs claims and unapproved change orders 
such amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value and take into account factors that may affect the ability to bill unbilled revenues and collect amounts after billing 
no profit is recognized in connection with claim amounts 
as of december  and  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included unbilled revenues for unapproved change orders of approximately million and million  respectively  and claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  accounts receivable as of december  and include claims of approximately million and million  respectively  plus unapproved change orders and contractually billed amounts related to such contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
generally  contractually billed amounts will not be paid by the customer to us until final resolution of related claims 
due to uncertainties inherent in estimates employed in applying percentage of completion accounting  estimates may be revised as project work progresses 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of revised estimates be reported prospectively in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to revenue recognition for long term construction contracts  we recognize revenues from services contracts as such contracts are performed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revised and updated sab 
there are two basic types of services contracts a fixed price services contracts which are signed in advance for maintenance  repair and retrofit work over periods typically ranging from one to three years pursuant to which our employees may be at a customer s site full time and b services contracts which may or may not be signed in advance for similar maintenance  repair and retrofit work on an as needed basis frequently referred to as time and material work 
fixed price services contracts are generally performed over the contract period  and accordingly  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract 
revenues derived from other services contracts are recognized when the services are performed in accordance with sab expenses related to all services contracts are recognized as incurred 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables 
relevant assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer  our prior collection history with the customer and related aging of past due balances 
the provisions for bad debts during  and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  our accounts receivable of  million and  million  respectively  included allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
specific accounts receivable are evaluated when we believe a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition or its credit ratings 
the allowance requirements are based on the best facts available and are re evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis and as additional information is received 
insurance liabilities we have deductibles for certain workers compensation  auto liability  general liability and property claims  have self insured retentions for certain other casualty claims  and are self insured for employee related health care claims 
losses are recorded based upon estimates of our liability for claims incurred and for claims incurred but not reported 
the liabilities are derived from known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of these obligations 
we believe the liabilities recognized on our balance sheets for these obligations are adequate 
however  such obligations are difficult to assess and estimate due to numerous factors  including severity of injury  determination of liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences and effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if our actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and will be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from deductible temporary differences of milion and million at december  and  respectively  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  and  the total valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in the valuation allowance for was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences of our canada construction and facilities services segment inasmuch as there is uncertainty of sufficient future income from this segment to realize the benefit of such deferred tax assets 
additionally  an increase in the valuation allowance was required for an increase in the deferred tax asset recorded to reflect an increase in the minimum pension liability for the united kingdom pension plan inasmuch as there is uncertainity of sufficient future income from the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment to realize the benefit of such deferred tax assets 
goodwill and intangible assets as of december   we had goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets primarily the market value of our backlog  customer relationships and trademarks and trade names of million and million  respectively  arising out of the acquisition of companies 
the determination of related estimated useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and whether those assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment  on at least an annual basis each october  and be written down when impaired  rather than amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas requires that identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances 
as of december   no indicators of impairment of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment review  which was performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
see note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the provisions of sfas and sfas discussion and analysis of results of operations the reportable segments reflect  in all years presented  discontinued operations accounting due to the sale of a subsidiary in and certain reclassifications of prior years amounts among the segments due to changes in emcor s internal reporting structure 
revenues as described below in more detail  revenues for and were approximately billion 
although the total revenues in the two years were approximately the same  revenues when compared to were positively impacted by increased private sector commercial construction and discretionary project work  offset by our planned curtailment of work on certain types of public sector and other longer term projects by certain of our subsidiaries 
revenues for increased to billion compared to billion for this revenue growth in was principally due to a increased work on united states transportation infrastructure  financial services  healthcare and hospitality construction projects  b the impact of favorable foreign exchange rate changes on revenues generated in the canada construction and facilities services segment despite reduced revenues from our canadian segment as a consequence of certain power generation and healthcare projects having been completed in and in the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment and c an increase in the number of united states site based facilities services contracts 
this growth in revenues was partially offset by reduced revenues from power generation projects  office and manufacturing construction projects and repair and maintenance work in the united states 
our contract backlog at december  was billion compared to billion at december  the increase in backlog compared to the prior year end was primarily due to the addition of private sector construction contracts  partially offset by the curtailment of work on certain types of public sector and other longer term projects at certain subsidiaries 
this increase in backlog has been supplemented by an increase in smaller shorter term discretionary project work 
a portion of the increase in such work is not included in backlog due to its shorter duration ie work started and completed in less than a three month period 
backlog is not a term recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  however  it is a common measurement used in our industry 
backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of facilities services contracts 
however  if the remaining term of a facilities services contract exceeds months  the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in the backlog are limited to only months of revenues 
the following table presents emcor s revenues by operating segment and the approximate percentages that each segment s revenues was of total revenues for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of total total total revenues from unrelated entities united states electrical construction and facilities services    united states mechanical construction and facilities services    united states facilities services total united states operations    canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services total worldwide operations    revenues of our united states electrical construction and facilities services segment for decreased million compared to the decrease in revenues were primarily attributable to reduced transportation infrastructure construction work and construction work for financial services firms  partially offset by increased commercial construction and discretionary project work generally due to the greater availability of such work 
revenues for decreased million compared to the decrease in revenues was primarily due to fewer power generation and manufacturing construction projects available  partially offset by an increase in the availability of transportation infrastructure  financial services and hospitality work 
revenues of our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment for decreased million compared to the revenues decrease was primarily attributable to a planned decrease in activities of certain subsidiaries related to the reduction in certain types of public sector and other long term projects undertaken  partially offset by increased wastewater treatment and hospitality projects undertaken by certain of our subsidiaries and increased discretionary project work 
the increase in discretionary project work was partially attributable to seasonably warm weather conditions in compared to unseasonably cool weather conditions in revenues for increased million compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased work on healthcare  hospitality and financial services construction projects  partially offset by decreased power generation work  commerical work  discretionary small projects and repair and maintenance work 
in  our mid western markets were negatively impacted by a fall off in available outage upgrade and replacement work at manufacturing facilities 
in addition  revenues in were negatively impacted by declines in small and discretionary projects and repairs and maintenance work caused largely by the cooler than normal summer weather conditions in parts of the united states 
united states facilities services revenues  which include our operations that principally provide maintenance and consulting services  increased million for compared to the increase was primarily attributable to increases in the availability of discretionary project work due to improved economic conditions  an increase in mobile services revenues which was partially attributable to seasonably warm weather conditions compared to unseasonably cool weather conditions for and increases in the number of site based operations contracts as a result of increased sales efforts 
revenues increased million for compared to the increase in revenues for was primarily attributable to increased site based facilities services contracts as a result of increased sales efforts 
revenues of the canada construction and facilities services segment increased by million for compared to the increase in revenues were due to increased discretionary project work at manufacturing facilities  construction work at oil and gas extraction facilities  construction work at hospitals and power transmission line work generally due to the greater availability of such work 
the revenues increases also reflected an increase of million related to the change in the rate of exchange of canadian dollars for united states dollars due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
revenues decreased by million for compared to this decrease was primarily due to the completion in of certain long term power generation and healthcare projects  partially offset by increased revenues from power transmission projects 
the decrease was also partially offset by million of increased revenues resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange of canadian dollars for united states dollars due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
united kingdom construction and facilities services revenues decreased million for compared to  principally due to a million decrease related to the rate of exchange of british pounds for united states dollars due to the weakening of the british pound  partially offset by increased small discretionary project work 
revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase in revenues was principally due to an increase of million resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange of british pounds for united states dollars due to strengthening of the british pound and to increases in transportation infrastructure work 
other international construction and facilities services activities consist of operations primarily in south africa until the sale of our interest in its south african joint venture in august and in the middle east 
during each of  and  all of the projects in these markets were performed by joint ventures  and accordingly  the results of these joint venture operations were accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we continue to pursue new business selectively in the middle eastern and european markets  however  the availability of opportunities in these markets has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents cost of sales  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages cost of sales    gross profit gross profit margin our gross profit revenues less cost of sales increased million for compared to gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to improvements in united states and united kingdom construction contract performance compared to the prior year primarily related to an increase in generally more profitable commercial construction work  the greater availability of generally higher margin small discretionary project work including mobile services work  a decrease in certain types of public sector work which is generally less profitable  an improvement in gross profit in the canada construction and facilities services segment and a favorable settlement of an insurance coverage related dispute of approximately million 
these improvements were partially offset by the results of the uosa action which resulted in million of non cash expenses during the increase in gross profit also reflected an increase of million related to the change in the rate of exchange of canadian dollars for united states dollars due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  offset by a decrease of million related to the rate of exchange of british pounds for united states dollars due to the weakening of the british pound 
our gross profit decreased million for compared to gross profit margin was for compared to for gross profit for was lower than in the prior year  despite greater revenues than in  primarily due to a greater than originally estimated labor requirements to perform work as well as continued reduced labor productivity due to the uncertain construction job market  b reduced availability of higher margin small and discretionary project spending and repair and maintenance work  c increased competition for  and a related decrease in gross profit on  commercial  industrial and public sector work in the united states and d increased prices for material required for certain construction projects  which price increases particularly negatively impacted the canada construction and facilities services segment gross profit 
positively impacting overall gross profit margin during were improved gross profit from the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment and increased gross profit from united states transportation infrastructure  financial services and hospitality projects due to the increased availability and successful performance of these types of projects 
additionally  total gross profit increased million in compared to  primarily resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange for british pounds to united states dollars 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table presents selling  general and administrative expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million to million compared to million for selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for compared to for selling  general and administrative expenses were impacted in by increased incentive compensation expense due to our improved profitability 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million compared to selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for compared to for this decline in selling  general and administrative expenses both in dollars and as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel 
restructuring expenses restructuring expenses  primarily relating to employee severance obligations  were million and million for and  respectively 
as of december   the balance of these obligations was million  which we anticipate paying during there were no restructuring expenses for the year ended december  gain on sale of assets the gain on sale of assets of million for the year ended december  was related to the september sale of assets of our united kingdom delcommerce equipment rental services division 
concurrently with the sale  we entered into a long term agreement to utilize the equipment rental services of the purchaser  a publicly traded united kingdom company 
in addition to this sale  there were no other sales of such assets in  or other than the disposal of property  plant and equipment in the normal course of business 
operating income the following table presents our operating income gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses  restructuring expenses plus gain on sale of assets by segment  and each segment s operating income as a percentage of its segment s revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of segment segment segment revenues revenues revenues operating income loss united states electrical construction and facilities services united states mechanical construction and facilities services united states facilities services total united states operations canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services corporate administration restructuring expense gain on sale of assets total worldwide operations other corporate items interest expense interest income gain on sale of equity investment minority interest income from continuing operations before income taxes as described in more detail below  our operating income was million for  million for and million for operating income increased million compared to primarily due to a generally improved performance on united states and united kingdom construction contracts  b greater availability of generally higher margin discretionary project work in the united states and united kingdom  c the settlement of an insurance coverage related dispute which contributed approximately million  d a generally improved economic environment  particularly for the commercial construction industry and e reduced losses in the canada construction and facilities services segment 
excluding restructuring expenses of million and a gain on the sale of assets of million  operating income increased million compared to operating income for compared to was also impacted by other factors previously discussed in the overview above 
operating income was favorably impacted by million  million and million in  and  respectively  in reduction of insurance liabilities previously established for insurance exposures as a consequence of effective risk management and safety programs 
our united states electrical construction and facilities services segment operating income was million for  a million decrease compared to operating income of million for the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of reduced transportation infrastructure and financial services projects  mostly offset by increased commercial construction and discretionary project work and approximately million of income resulting from the settlement of the insurance coverage related dispute referred to earlier 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in personnel and a reduction in incentive compensation expense related to reduced profitability 
operating income for increased million compared to this increase in operating income  when compared to  was attributable principally to increased gross profit on transportation infrastructure  financial services and hospitality construction projects due to the increased availability and successful performance of these types of projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in  when compared to  due to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel 
our united states mechanical construction and facilities services operating income for was million  a million improvement  when compared to an operating loss of million the operating income reflects an approximately million reduction in gross profit as a result of the write off of unrecovered costs related to the uosa action 
notwithstanding the impact of the uosa action  this segment had generally improved results for as a consequence of a improved construction performance when compared to construction performance for partially due to the greater availability of generally more profitable private sector commercial construction work as a result of improved economic conditions and b increased discretionary project work which was partially attributable to seasonably warm weather conditions compared to unseasonably cool weather conditions in in addition  operating income for includes approximately million of income resulting from the settlement of the insurance coverage related dispute referred to earlier 
the improvement in performance was partially attributable to our planned curtailment of certain public sector and other longer term contracts of certain of our subsidiaries  which work is generally been less profitable than private sector work currently being performed 
increased selling  general and administrative expenses related to increased incentive compensation expense due to the segment s improved profitability was partially offset by personnel reductions during  which reductions also contributed to the improvement in operating income 
the operating loss for was million compared to operating income of million for the segment s operating loss was primarily attributable to a decreases in the recovery of estimated costs upon completion of certain projects  principally in the western united states  b poor performance on certain construction work related to greater labor requirements than originally estimated to perform the work and continued reduced labor productivity due to the uncertain construction job market  c a continued decrease in the availability of generally more profitable discretionary small projects and repair and maintenance work due to general economic conditions negatively impacting commercial construction spending and d increased competition for  and a related decrease in gross profit margin on  commercial  industrial and public sector work 
partially offsetting these operating results for were decreased selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel and to reduced incentive compensation due to less favorable financial performance 
operating income of our united states facilities services segment for increased by million compared to during  operating income improved primarily due to improved gross margins on increased revenues  which for the mobile services business was partially related to seasonably warm weather conditions in compared to unseasonably cool weather conditions in  partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses for related to increased incentive compensation due to improved financial performance 
operating income for decreased million compared to the reduced operating income was primarily related to a decrease in revenues from  and profits earned on  discretionary small projects and repair and maintenance work due to general economic conditions negatively impacting commercial construction spending and an increase in expenses for site based facilities services business development 
in addition  during this segment also incurred approximately million of losses on certain construction projects  outside of the normal facilities services operations of this segment  that were contracted for by a subsidiary in this segment prior to our acquisition of the subsidiary 
the decrease in operating income for compared to was partially offset by a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses related to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel 
our canada construction and facilities services operating loss was million for compared to an operating loss of million for the loss was primarily associated with a large power transmission project  severance expenses not associated with restructuring activities and legal expenses 
the impact of exchange rate movements increased operating losses by million for compared to the operating loss for was million compared to operating income of million for the loss was primarily due to greater labor requirements than originally estimated to perform certain projects  increased material prices and the completion of certain long term power generation projects in that were absent in the impact of exchange rate movements increased operating losses by million for compared to our united kingdom construction and facilities services operating income for was million compared to breakeven for this improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to improved performance on construction projects and to a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses related to a reorganization of the united kingdom operations  partially offset by increased incentive compensation due to improved financial performance 
operating income was breakeven in compared to an operating loss of million for this improvement was primarily attributable to a an improvement in the gross profit as the contracts causing large losses  which were incurred in  were substantially completed by december  and to b reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses related to a reorganization of the united kingdom operations in late the operating loss was primarily attributable to a net unfavorable settlements and closeouts of certain construction projects completed during that year  b increased bad debt expense of million in primarily related to the then potential non payment of a large customer account receivable which account receivable was subsequently written off against the allowance in  c reorganization expenses of approximately million related to employee severance expenses and the closing of several offices and d million resulting from the impact of the change in exchange rates due to strengthening of the british pound 
other international construction and facilities services operating income was at breakeven for compared to operating income of million for and million for emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in the middle eastern and european markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
our corporate administration expense for was million compared to million for this increase in expense was primarily due to increased incentive compensation  and to a lesser extent  increased professional fees and the absence of a non recurring benefit attributable to expense reimbursement that occurred in general corporate expenses for increased by million compared to primarily due to the negative impact of higher audit fees and other costs of complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of however  these increased costs in compared to were largely offset by other expense reductions 
non operating items interest expense was million for and million for both and decreased borrowings under the revolving credit facility for compared to and  was partially offset by the impact of increases in interest rates during and interest income increased by million for compared to and increased by million for compared to due primarily to interest earned on cash provided by the united kingdom constructon and facilities services segment  as such cash was invested in the united kingdom at interest rates generally greater than the net cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
the million gain on sale of an equity investment of was attributable to the august sale of our interest in a south african joint venture  the operating results of which had been reported previously in the other international construction and facilities services segment 
minority interest represents the allocation of earnings to those of our joint venture partners who have a minority ownership interest in joint ventures to which we are a party and which joint ventures have been consolidated 
for  the income tax provision was million compared to an income tax provision of less than million for our income tax provision for was comprised of a million of income tax provision in respect of pre tax earnings of million  b million of income tax provision related to a valuation allowance recorded to reduce deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences with respect to our canadian construction and facilities services segment  since there is uncertainty as to whether the segment will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the benefit of such deferred tax assets and c the offset of such income tax provisions by a million income tax benefit for income tax reserves no longer required based on a current analysis of probable exposures 
the income tax benefit of less than million for was comprised of a million of income tax provision on pre tax earnings of million  b million of income tax provision related to a valuation allowance recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences of the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment inasmuch as there is uncertainty of sufficent future income to realize the benefit of such deferred tax assets and c the partial offset of such income tax provisions by million of income tax benefits for income tax reserves no longer required based on current analysis of probable exposures 
the provision on income before income taxes for each of  and was recorded at an effective income tax rate of approximately  and  respectively 
on september   we disposed of one of our subsidiaries in our united states facilities services segment 
the results of operations for all periods presented reflect discontinued operations accounting

represents primarily insurance related liabilities  classified as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash payments for insurance related liabilities may be payable beyond three years  but it is not practical to estimate 
we classify these borrowings as short term on its consolidated balance sheet because of our intent and ability to repay the amounts on a short term basis 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
our previous revolving credit agreement the old revolving credit facility made as of september   as amended  provided for a credit facility of million 
effective october   we replaced the old revolving credit facility that was due to expire september  with an amended and restated million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires on october  it permits us to increase our borrowing to million if additional lenders are identified and or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments 
we utilized this feature to increase the line of credit under the revolving credit facility from million to million on november  we may allocate up to million of the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to letters of credit  which amount compares to million under the previous old revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of our subsidiaries  and provides for borrowings in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the fee ranges from to of the unused amount  based on certain financial tests 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris na from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or united states dollar libor at december   the rate was plus to  based on certain financial tests 
the interest rates in effect at december  were and for the prime commercial lending rate and the united states dollar libor  respectively 
letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to of the respective face amounts of the letters of credit issued and are charged based on the type of letter of credit issued and certain financial tests 
in connection with the replacement of the old revolving credit facility  million of prepaid commitment fees were recorded as interest expense 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  we had borrowings of million outstanding under the old revolving credit facility at december  in august  our canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  renewed a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million 
the facility is secured by a standby letter of credit and provides for interest at the bank s prime rate  which was at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  or one of our subsidiaries has guaranteed indebtedness of a venture in which we have a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric a subsidiary of constellation energy  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning commercial properties 
these guarantees are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we and baltimore gas and electric are jointly and severally liable  in the event of default  for the venture s million borrowing due december the terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies surety companies and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts 
the surety bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts  and we have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts  if any  paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees  surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts  and accordingly  our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   surety companies had issued surety bonds for our account in the aggregate amount of approximately billion 
the surety bonds are issued by surety companies in return for premiums  which vary depending on the size and type of bond 
the largest single surety bond outstanding for our account is approximately million 
in recent periods there has been a reduction in the aggregate bond issuance capacity of surety companies due to industry consolidations and significant losses of surety companies as a result of providing surety bonds to construction companies as well as companies in other industries 
consequently  the availability of surety bonds has become more limited and the terms upon which surety bonds are available have become more restrictive 
we had been notified earlier in by one of our surety companies  which provides approximately of our surety bonds  that it the terminating surety would be terminating its surety bond business 
following that notification  we entered into an arrangement with another surety company in august to provide us with the level of surety bonds previously provided by the terminating surety 
if we experience other changes in our bonding relationships or if there are further changes in the surety industry  we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds such as letters of credit or guarantees by emcor group  inc  by seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement of a surety bond  by increasing our activities in business segments that rarely require surety bonds such as the facilities services segment and or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain  on favorable terms  sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds to replace projects requiring surety bonds that we may decline to pursue 
accordingly  if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of surety bonds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flow 
we do not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
our primary source of liquidity has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
we also maintain the revolving credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
we may also increase liquidity through an equity offering or issuance of other debt instruments 
short term changes in macroeconomic trends may have an affect  positively or negatively  on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  our focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns inasmuch as the facilities services business is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during economic downturns  such as the downturn during through in the commercial construction industry  there were typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies like us more aggressively bid more large long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires working capital until initial billing milestones are achieved 
while we strive to maintain a net over billed position with our customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained 
our net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities  the revolving credit facility and the sale of various secured or unsecured debt and or equity interests in the public and private markets 
based upon our current credit ratings and financial position  we can reasonably expect to be able to issue long term debt instruments and or equity 
over the long term  our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition to the primary revenue risk factor  our ability to perform work at profitable levels is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
we believe that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available through debt or equity offerings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if we were required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain insurance matters as of december   we utilized approximately million of letters of credit issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility as collateral for insurance obligations 
new accounting pronouncement on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  opinion and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than january  as of january   we will adopt statement r 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we will utilize the modified prospective method of accounting as permitted under r 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on our future results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of that standard on reported results would be approximately as described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used any material derivative financial instruments during the years ended december  and  including trading or speculating on changes in interest rates or commodity prices of materials used in our business 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under that facility bear interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this borrowing is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
had there been borrowings  they would bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris na from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or united states dollar libor at december   the rate was plus to  based on certain financial tests 
the revolving credit facility expires in october we are also exposed to market risk and the market s potential related impact on accounts receivable or costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the amounts recorded may be at risk if our customers ability to pay these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions 
we continually monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and maintain on going discussions with customers regarding contract status with respect to change orders and billing terms 
therefore  we believe we take appropriate action to manage market and other risks  but there is no assurance that we will be able to reasonably identify all risks with respect to collectibility of these assets 
see also the previous discussion of accounts receivable under the heading application of critical accounting policies in the management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into u 
s 
dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective local currencies 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in their same local currencies
