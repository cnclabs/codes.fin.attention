table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
on may   we completed the sale of our commworks division and transferred certain assets and liabilities to utstarcom  inc as a result of the sale  we reported the commworks division as a discontinued operation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
business overview we provide secure  converged networking solutions on a global scale to businesses of all sizes 
our products and solutions enable customers to manage business critical voice and data in a secure and efficient network environment 
we deliver networking products and services for enterprises that view their networks as mission critical and value superior performance 
our products form integrated solutions and function in multi vendor environments 
our products are sold on a worldwide basis through a combination of value added partners and direct sales representatives 
our long term technology based strategy centers on enterprises and public sector organizations migrating to secure internet protocol ip based infrastructures that deliver converged voice and data applications 
our products and services can generally be classified in the following categories networking  security  voice  services  and connectivity products 
we have undergone significant changes in recent years  including significant headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities  restructuring activities which included outsourcing of information technology  all manufacturing activity in our scn segment  and other functions  and selling excess facilities  significant changes to our executive leadership  forming the huawei com joint venture h c  acquisition of majority ownership of h c  acquiring tippingpoint technologies  inc  and realigning our sales and marketing channels and expenditures 
we believe an overview of these significant recent events is helpful to an understanding of our operating results 
significant events in fiscal  we undertook a number of actions  affecting both sales and expenses 
we expanded our product portfolio to include more layer plus and higher end products  additional modular switches and routers  and a higher end voip offering 
we consolidated our operations into a single integrated business organized along functional lines  and we relocated headquarters and key management positions and functions from our santa clara  california location to our marlborough  massachusetts location 
also  we consolidated our operations into fewer facilities  disposed of excess real estate  relocated transaction processing activities to lower cost locations  outsourced our dublin  ireland manufacturing operations to our contract manufacturers  and upgraded and modified our it infrastructure and systems to more cost effective alternatives 
in addition  during fiscal  we reduced our overall workforce by approximately forty percent 

table of contents on november   we formed our joint venture  huawei com h c  which is domiciled in hong kong and has its principal operating center in hangzhou  china 
we contributed million in cash  assets related to our operations in china and japan  and licenses to intellectual property related to those operations in exchange for a percent ownership interest of the joint venture 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we expanded the joint venture s market to include hong kong in addition to china and japan 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we further expanded h c s available markets to include several additional countries 
we expect this venture to continue to provide three key benefits to us an expanded product line  access to lower cost and highly effective engineering talent  and a significant presence in the china  japan  hong kong  and other developing markets 
h c sells its own products  as well as products it purchases directly from huawei and us 
outside of china  japan  and hong kong  we resell h c s products under the com brand 
through this reseller agreement  we have expanded our product line to include router products and modular switching products 
we believe the addition of these products to our product portfolio increases the size of the market opportunity for which we can compete 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we entered an agreement with siemens business services to provide expanded service offerings on a global basis for enterprise customers 
this agreement was fully deployed during fiscal on january   we acquired tippingpoint technologies  inc tippingpoint  a provider of network based intrusion prevention systems 
we believe the acquired technologies are uniquely qualified to protect a converged voice and data environment 
we believe our acquisition of those technologies will expand our ability to design innovative and reliable voice  data and security solutions 
during fiscal  we exercised our right to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest in h c and entered into an agreement with huawei for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
we were granted regulatory approval by the chinese government and subsequently completed this transaction on january  date of acquisition 
consequently  we now own a majority interest in the joint venture and have determined that the criteria of emerging issues task force no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights have been met 
accordingly  we consolidated h c s financial statements from the date of acquisition 
both partners have the right to initiate a bid process to purchase all of the other partner s ownership interest at any time after the third anniversary of h c s formation 
during fiscal we undertook several actions that we believe will enhance our competitiveness  execution and profitability over the longer term 
we implemented a strategy to compete in the enterprise networking market  through the following continued advances in products  and increased focus on our customer facing capabilities in the areas of sales and marketing 
we have introduced multiple new products targeted at the large enterprise market  including modular switches and routers sourced from our joint venture  h c  as well as voip  security and wireless solutions 
we also continue to develop solutions for the small to medium enterprise market  including voip  smart switches  and power over ethernet technology 
during the year ended may  we have increased our focus on sales and marketing activities 
initiatives included developing an expanded set of enterprise class channels to support effective sales into the large enterprise market  and implementing marketing programs that we believe will improve our effectiveness and productivity in our existing channels  particularly those that target small and medium sized businesses 
we are currently re assessing our go to market model and expect to make changes that will increase our effectiveness 
business environment and future trends networking industry analysts and participants differ widely in their assessments concerning the prospects for near term industry growth 
industry factors and trends also present significant challenges in the medium term with respect to our goals for sales growth  gross margin improvement and profitability 
such factors and trends include intense competition in the market for higher end  enterprise core routing and switching products  aggressive product pricing by competitors targeted at gaining share in market segments where we 
table of contents have had a strong position historically  such as the small to medium sized enterprise market  and the advanced nature and ready availability of merchant silicon  which allows low end competitors to deliver competitive products and makes it increasingly difficult for us to differentiate our products 
our key focus in fiscal is to manage our h c operating segment for expected growth and to manage our scn operating segment towards our goal of a return to profitability while maintaining strong investment levels in our tippingpoint security products and sales teams 
in fiscal  we plan to continue investment in the h c segment that provided strong growth in fiscal this involves continued investment in research and development  increased distribution both inside and outside of china  and growing the infrastructure 
we continue to face significant challenges in the scn segment with respect to sales growth  gross margin and profitability 
future sales growth for the scn segment depends to a substantial degree on increased sales of our networking products  and we believe our best growth opportunity requires us to expand our product lines targeting selected enterprise customers 
in order to achieve our sales goals in the scn segment for fiscal  it is imperative that we continue to enhance the features and capabilities of these products in a timely manner in order to expand our addressable market opportunities  distribution channels and market competitiveness 
also  we expect a very competitive  difficult pricing environment for the foreseeable future  this will likely exert downward pressure on our scn sales  gross margin and profitability 
another key priority will be to determine future h c ownership pursuant to the bid process or otherwise 
on august   we announced that we will begin negotiations with huawei for the purchase by us of an additional equity interest in h c 
we currently own of h c and huawei owns 
under the terms of our existing shareholders agreement  and as previously disclosed  we each have the right  commencing on and after november   to initiate a bid process to purchase the equity interest in h c held by the other 
the negotiations are intended to result in an agreement outside of the bid process 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms with huawei or that the transaction will be consummated at all 
we may need to raise equity or debt capital in order to finance any such transaction  and such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may also use existing cash to finance a portion of the consideration for any such transaction  which  if used  would reduce available cash on hand 
in connection with our efforts in the scn segment to achieve profitability and realign our cost structure to better reflect our recent performance  on june  we committed to a restructuring plan consisting of facilities closures and a reduction in workforce 
the plan includes the closure of of existing sites around the world and a reduction in force of approximately full time employees in our scn business segment which represents approximately of that segment s full time employee base as of the end of june  period 
we currently estimate the total restructuring charges associated with these actions to be in the range of approximately million to million  of which between million to million is expected to be cash charges primarily related to severance payments and approximately million is expected to be cash charges related to facilities closures and consolidation such as lease termination payments 
the information set forth above includes separate actions taken prior to june  at our santa clara  ca facilities 
we are also focusing on converting non core assets  such as real estate and certain venture investments  to cash  as further discussed elsewhere in this report 
our planned actions for fiscal are based on certain assumptions concerning the overall economic outlook for the markets in which we operate  the expected demand for our products  our ability to compete effectively and gain market share  and the cost and expense structure of our business 
these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
if current economic conditions deteriorate  or if our planned actions are not successful in achieving our goals  there could be additional adverse impacts on our financial position  sales  profitability or cash flows 
in that case  we might need to modify our strategic focus and restructure our business again to realign our resources and achieve additional cost and expense savings 
we are committed to our objective of being a leading provider of secure  converged networking solutions for small  medium and large enterprises 
we believe that our recent initiatives and our business strategy are consistent with our goals of growth and profitability over the longer term 
on august   our president and chief executive officer  r 
scott murray  submitted a letter of resignation from his office as our president and chief executive officer  his membership on our board of directors and his position as chairman of the board of h c 
mr 
murray s resignations are effective at the close of business on august  and his departure is voluntary 
on august   our board of directors appointed edgar masri as our new president and chief executive officer  effective on his start date which is expected to be on august  mr 
masri will also assume the role of chairman of h c 
mr 
masri will join our board of directors  effective immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders on september  we also announced the appointment of robert mao as our new executive vice president  corporate development to manage our interests in h c 
we currently expect that these appointments will not materially change the strategies and key priorities for fiscal described above or our existing cost reduction initiatives designed to return our scn segment to profitability  including the implementation of our previously announced june restructuring plan 
basis of presentation our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to may fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on june  fiscal year  consisted of weeks ended on june   and fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on may  
table of contents for convenience  the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 
during fiscal we exercised our right to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest in h c and entered into an agreement with huawei for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we were granted regulatory approval by the chinese government and subsequently completed this transaction on january  date of acquisition 
consequently  we now own a majority interest in the joint venture and have determined that the criteria of emerging issues task force no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights have been met 
accordingly  we consolidate h c s financial statements from the date of acquisition 
both partners have the right to initiate a bid process to purchase all of the other partner s ownership interest at any time after the third anniversary of h c s formation 
during the three months ended may  we completed our preliminary purchase price allocation 
the acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the assets purchased and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of may  using h c s march  balance sheet data 
because h c follows a calendar year end  we report its results on a two month lag 
the operating results of h c are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition  resulting in the latter two months of h c s three months ended march  being included in our year ended may  statement of operations 
following the h c acquisition we determined that our chief decision making officer receives reports  manages  and operates our business as two separate units  the scn business and the h c business 
as a result we currently report two operating segments  scn and h c 
see footnote note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segments 
prior to the acquisition we accounted for our investment in h c by the equity method 
under this method  we recorded our proportionate share of h c s net income or loss based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements of h c under the caption equity interest in income loss of unconsolidated joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
since h c has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we have reported our equity in h c s net income loss for h c s fiscal period from april  through march  in our results of operations for fiscal and from the date of formation november  through march  in our results of operations for fiscal our acquisition of tippingpoint on january   was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the assets purchased and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of may  the operating results of tippingpoint are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
accordingly  fiscal contains a full year of tippingpoint s results compared to five months of results in fiscal critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which appear in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation revenue recognition we recognize a sale when the product has been delivered and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the fee is fixed or determinable 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable considers whether a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms 
if we determine that the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue at the time the fee becomes due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
also  sales arrangements may contain customer specific acceptance requirements for both products and services 
in such cases  revenue is deferred at the time of delivery of the product or service and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all the undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered 
table of contents elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of the fee is not reasonably assured  then we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
we do not typically request collateral from our customers 
in the h c segment  certain customers pay accounts receivable with bills receivable from chinese banks with maturities less than six months 
these are also referred to as bankers acceptances 
a significant portion of our sales is made to distributors and value added resellers vars 
revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales to these customers are recorded net of appropriate allowances  including estimates for product returns  price protection  and excess channel inventory levels 
we maintain reserves for potential allowances and adjustments  if the actual level of returns and adjustments differ from the assumptions we use to develop those reserves  additional allowances and charges might be required 
for sales of products that contain software that is marketed separately  we apply the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sales of services  including professional services  system integration  project management  and training  are recognized upon delivery and completion of performance 
other service revenue  such as that related to maintenance and support contracts  is recognized ratably over the contract term  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
royalty revenue is generally recognized when we receive payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we monitor payments from our customers on an on going basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts  and geographic and political risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or net realizable value 
we perform detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of inventory on an ongoing basis  for both inventory on hand and inventory that we are committed to purchase  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to cost of sales might be required  alternatively  we might realize benefits through cost of sales for sale or disposition of inventory that had been previously written off 
goodwill and intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting literature 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we review the value of our intangible assets in accordance with the applicable accounting literature for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
as of may   we had million of goodwill and million of net intangible assets remaining on our balance sheet  which we currently believe to be realizable based on the estimated fair value of these assets 
we estimate fair value of goodwill using third party valuation reports and the fair value of our intangible assets using estimated future cash flows of the associated products and technology 
it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the carrying value of these assets  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be re evaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of these assets 
equity securities and other investments we account for non marketable equity securities and other investments at historical cost or  if we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee  by the equity method 
investments accounted for by the equity method include investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and  prior to the acquisition of majority ownership on january   the investment in h c 
in accounting for these investments by the equity method  we record our proportionate share of the fund s net income or loss  or h c s net income or loss  based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements 
since h c has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we reported our equity in h c s net income or loss based on h c s most recent quarterly financial statements  two months in arrears 
for the year ended may  we accounted for h c under the equity method for ten months of the year 

table of contents we review all of our investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in the event that the investment impairment is other than temporary  we would write the investment down to its impaired value 
restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives have required us to record restructuring charges related to severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  accelerated depreciation and write downs of held for sale properties  write downs of other long term assets  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of our restructuring activities and the time required for execution and completion of such activities  the process of estimating restructuring charges is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments requires us to record charges when we have taken actions or have the appropriate approval for taking action  and when a liability is incurred 
our policies require us to periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
as we continue to evaluate the business  we might be required to record additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on our products for periods ranging from days to limited lifetime  depending upon the product  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales might be required 
income taxes we are subject to income tax in a number of jurisdictions 
a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes  and it is reasonably possible that such assets may not be recovered and that such liabilities may not be paid or that payments in excess of amounts initially estimated and accrued may be required 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on various factors  including our recent losses  retained deficit  operating performance in fiscal  and estimates of future profitability  we have concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our us net deferred tax assets as of may  accordingly  we have established an appropriate valuation allowance to offset such deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  we maintain reserves for potential tax contingencies arising in jurisdictions in which we do or have done business 
many of these contingencies arise from periods when we were a substantially larger company 
such reserves are based on our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the expected potential loss from such contingency  and are monitored by management 
these reserves are maintained until such time as the matter is settled or the statutory period for adjustment has passed 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the valuation allowance we have recorded or that our reserves for tax contingencies are inadequate 
we have us federal loss carryforwards of approximately billion as of may  expiring between fiscal years and

table of contents comparison of fiscal and sales the increase in sales from the fiscal year to the fiscal year was primarily due to the inclusion of two months of h c sales in the current period  as well as increased sales of tippingpoint security products and the inclusion of tippingpoint s results for the full current period 
the increase was partially offset by decreases in networking revenues in our scn segment 
the following table shows our sales from products categories in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales for fiscal and fiscal in millions fiscal year networking security voice services connectivity products total sales of networking products in fiscal increased from fiscal networking revenue includes sales of the h c sourced enterprise products  our layer and layer stackable managed switching lines  wireless and officeconnect hardware  baseline branded small to medium sized enterprise market products  and h c s router and switching products 
the increase in sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of two months results from the h c joint venture 
we also saw growth from the introduction of the line of layer switches sourced from h c as well as growth in our modular core and router products 
this growth was partially offset by a decline in demand for layer switches and a reduction in average selling prices resulting from significant price competition  particularly for our mbps switching products as the industry migrates to gigabit switching solutions  and by a shift in mix towards lower priced products 
sales of security products in fiscal increased from fiscal security revenue includes our tippingpoint products and services  as well as other security products  such as our embedded firewall product 
the increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of tippingpoint s sales for the full period and  to a lesser extent  organic growth in sales of security products in fiscal and the inclusion of h c s security product sales 
sales of our embedded firewall products increased in the year ended may  voip telephony revenue includes our vcx and nbx voip product lines 
sales of our voip telephony products in fiscal increased from fiscal the increase in such sales was due largely to growth in the demand for our nbx products as well as a shift in focus to larger enterprise contracts 
incremental sales of vcx products and to a lesser extent  the inclusion of h c s voice products also contributed to the increase in voip telephony sales in fiscal services revenue includes professional services and maintenance contracts  excluding tippingpoint maintenance which is included in security 
connectivity products includes our traditional network interface card  personal computer card  and mini peripheral component interconnect form factors 
sales of our connectivity products in fiscal decreased from fiscal the decrease is a result of lower volumes as well as lower overall average selling prices in fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year offset in part by periodic royalty payments from the licensing of our intellectual property 
we believe the lower volumes resulted from a continuing shift in technology from traditional network interface card nic  personal computer pc card  and mini peripheral component interconnect mini pci form factors to pc chipsets with embedded networking technology for which we have lower market share 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we made a decision to end of life many connectivity products as we determined that the cost to ensure european union restriction of hazardous substance rohs compliance was not commensurate to our future projected revenue streams 
we expect sales from connectivity products to decline again in fiscal due to reduced demand for our products  our end of life decision and continued pricing pressures 

table of contents sales by geographic region are as follows in millions fiscal year north america latin and south america europe  middle east  and africa asia pacific total sales information by geography to the extent available is reported based on the customer s designated delivery point  except in the case of h c s oem sales which are based on the hub locations of h c s oem partners 
asia pacific sales increased primarily due to the inclusion of h c results for two months in fiscal gross profit margin gross margin as a percentage of sales improved percentage points from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal significant components of the improvement in gross profit margins were as follows increased sales of security products and inclusion of tippingpoint higher margin products for full current period consolidation of h c higher margin products scn product mix and selling price reductions royalty payment reductions other total the increase was the result of higher average selling prices and margin for tippingpoint s security products compared to other scn products as well as the inclusion of a full year of tippingpoint results in fiscal year the increase is due to the inclusion of two months of results of h c which generally have higher gross margins 
the decrease in the scn margin was the result of lower average selling prices and an unfavorable shift in product mix 
these declines were partially offset by product cost reductions 
fiscal year included final disbursements on two significant royalty payments 
other cost reduction activities included freight consolidation  and a reduction in the connectivity products business that consequently caused a decrease in unit shipment per revenue dollar which lowered variable costs 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
included in the increase in operating expenses were h c operating expenses of million for the two month period ended may  and the inclusion of a full year of tippingpoint operating expenses in fiscal as compared to five months in both of these factors were the primary contributors to increases in sales and marketing expenses of million  research and development expenses of million  general and administrative expenses of million  and amortization of intangibles of million 
the increase was partially offset by the decrease of in process research and development of million and restructuring charges of million 
as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were  compared to in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that to a 
table of contents significant degree  these expenses are controllable and discretionary over time  but they are not directly variable with sales levels within a particular period 
the most significant component of the increase of was the inclusion of million of h c expenses for the two months ended may  a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of h c expenses for the two months ended may  and tippingpoint s expenses for the entire current fiscal period 
in addition  our investment in our branding campaign and the incurrence of performance related compensation expenses in the year ended may   which were not incurred in the previous fiscal year  contributed to the increase 
employee incentive compensation is aligned to the accomplishment of specific financial objectives and certain of these objectives were met in the current fiscal year  whereas these objectives were not met in the previous fiscal year 
partially offsetting these increases were reduced headcount and related expenses in fiscal  compared to the same period in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of h c expenses for the two months ended may  and the inclusion of tippingpoint s expenses in the current fiscal period 
in addition  a million charge resulting from the impairment of licensed software was incurred for which we had no alternative future use 
the increase was offset by reduced workforce expenses as a result of restructuring activities and reduced project spending in the current year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million from fiscal this increase is due to h c expenses for the two months ended may  and the inclusion of tippingpoint s expenses in the current fiscal period and million related to executive transition costs in the current year 
these transition costs resulted from the departure of the former chief executive officer and the appointment of the current chief executive officer on january  in addition  we incurred performance related compensation expenses in the year ended may   which were not incurred in the previous fiscal year 
amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million 
amortization and write down of intangibles increased due to million of purchased intangibles acquired in the acquisition of of the equity of h c in fiscal that are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years 
partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in impairment charges 
in process research and development 
million of the total purchase price of of the equity of h c has been preliminarily allocated to in process research and development and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
at the time of acquisition  h c had multiple in process research and development efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal  including employee severance and outplacement costs of million  and facilities related charges of million 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of reductions in workforce and continued efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities 
we announced in june a multi faceted scn restructuring plan that will result in significant restructuring charges in fiscal described earlier 
the plan focuses on reducing components of the scn operating segment cost structure in order to achieve our goal of future profitability 
the plan includes the closure of approximately facilities around the world  a reduction in workforce of approximately full time employees  equating to approximately of our scn headcount  and focusing our sales  marketing  and services effort 
we currently expect that these actions will result in significant cost savings  although we intend to use some of these savings to invest in our tippingpoint security business 
further actions may be taken if our business activity declines and additional cost reduction efforts are necessary

table of contents during fiscal  net gains on investments were million  primarily reflecting gains from sales of certain equity securities 
during fiscal  net gains on investments were million  reflecting million of recognized gains from the sale of an investment in a privately held company and public traded securities partially offset by a net loss of million due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds 
interest income and other income expense  net interest and other income  net  was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million in fiscal an increase in interest income accounted for million of this increase  primarily attributable to higher interest rates applicable to short term investments and the inclusion of two months of h c results 
also contributing to the increase was million of other income from h c for an operating subsidy program by the chinese vat authorities in the form of a partial refund of vat taxes collected by h c from purchasers of software products  and a reduction in interest expense due to the expiration of our revolving credit facility in november according to its terms 
our results reflect a quarterly payment that was received during the two month period of h c s results that are in our consolidated financials 
future subsidy payments  which are funded by vat receipts  are subject to the discretion of chinese vat authorities

equity interest in income loss of unconsolidated joint venture as described more fully above  we accounted for our investment in h c by the equity method prior to the acquisition of majority ownership on january  in fiscal we recorded income of million representing our share of the net income from operations generated by h c from april  through january  in fiscal we recorded a charge of million representing our share of the net loss from operations incurred by h c from april  through march  minority interest of huawei in the income of consolidated huawei com joint venture in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing huawei interest in the net income reported by the h c joint venture for the two month period included in our fiscal comparison of fiscal and sales the following table shows our sales from enterprise networking products and desktop  mobile and server connectivity products in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales for fiscal and fiscal in millions fiscal year enterprise networking desktop  mobile and server connectivity total sales of enterprise networking products in fiscal increased two percent from fiscal the increase in sales was primarily driven by certain products in targeted high growth technology areas  such products included fixed configuration gigabit switches  wireless lan  and modular switches and routers sourced from h c 
increased sales of these products was largely due to higher unit volumes  resulting from both the industry shift towards gigabit switching solutions mentioned above  as well as enhanced sales and marketing efforts targeting enterprise customers 
these increases were partially offset 
table of contents by a reduction in average selling prices resulting from significant price competition  particularly for our mbps switching products as the industry migrates to gigabit switching solutions  and by a shift in mix towards lower priced products 
sales of our desktop  mobile and server connectivity products in fiscal decreased percent from fiscal the decrease in such sales was due largely to lower volumes as well as to lower overall average selling prices in fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year 
we believe the lower volumes resulted from a continuing shift in technology from traditional network interface card nic  personal computer pc card  and mini peripheral component interconnect mini pci form factors to pc chipsets with embedded networking technology for which we have lower market share 
the additional week included in fiscal did not have a significant impact on sales  compared to fiscal sales by geographic region are as follows in millions fiscal year americas europe  middle east  and africa asia pacific total sales information by geography is reported based on the customer s designated delivery point 
international sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal the major factor contributing to this decrease was lower sales of our desktop  mobile and server connectivity products  other important factors contributing to the decrease were lower sales of mbps switching products  as well as a decline in sales to customers in china  japan  and hong kong following h c s assumption of responsibility for sales of products into these territories 
gross profit margin gross profit margin as a percentage of sales improved percentage points from percent of sales in fiscal to percent of sales in fiscal significant components of the improvement in gross margins were as follows outsourced manufacturing and facility closure it and facilities related expenses volume related impacts other total gross profit margin benefited compared to fiscal due to effects associated with our decision to outsource our remaining manufacturing operations in dublin  ireland during fiscal in addition to the absence of impairment and transition costs that were incurred in fiscal and not in fiscal  these actions also resulted in lower operating costs 
we allocate and report both it and facilities related expenses as a component of cost of sales and operating expenses 
the portion of such expenses allocated to cost of sales decreased in fiscal due to the outsourcing of our it operations 
volume related impacts include higher post sale technical support costs  manufacturing overhead costs  royalty fees and warranty costs as a percent of sales 
these costs did not decline at the same rate as sales since a portion of these costs is not directly variable with sales 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to contract with siemens business services and enhance our customer service offerings 
this agreement resulted in transition costs in fiscal that were not incurred in fiscal operating expenses

in fiscal  impairment charges totaled million and solely related to the developed and core technology associated with nbx 
in process research and development

at the time of acquisition  tippingpoint had multiple in process research and development efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
we utilized the multi period excess earnings method to value the in process research and development 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
additionally  we incurred million of in process research and development expenses related to technology assets purchased during the first quarter of fiscal

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of may  were million  an increase of approximately million compared to the balance of million as of may  these balances were comprised of the following in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments cash and cash equivalents and short term investments the may  balances included cash and cash equivalents from h c of million 
the following table shows the major components of our statements of cash flows for the last three fiscal years years ended may  in millions cash and equivalents  beginning of period net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities other cash and equivalents  end of period net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  primarily reflecting our loss from continuing operations of million 
included in net cash used in operating activities was cash generated by the h c segment for the two months that were consolidated 
we expect that cash flows from operating activities will continue to be negative during fiscal  and possibly longer  primarily due to continuing net losses 
there are no assurances that we can reduce our net losses and negative cash flow in the foreseeable future  or that we can raise capital as needed to fund our operations on an ongoing basis 
however  based on current business conditions and our current operating and financial plans  we believe that our existing cash and equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
in connection with our june restructuring announcement described above we currently expect to incur cash charges of approximately million to million for severance costs and million for facilities closures and consolidation in fiscal 
table of contents significant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under lease  contract manufacturing and outsourcing agreements  as shown in the following table in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total one year years years years operating leases purchase commitments with contract manufacturers outsourcing agreements total includes scn segment obligations as of may  and h c segment obligations as of march  we have entered into purchase agreements with our contract manufacturers 
pursuant to these agreements  if our actual orders and purchases fall below forecasted levels  we may be required to purchase finished goods inventory manufactured to meet our requirements 
in addition  we may be required to purchase raw material and work in process inventory on hand that is unique to our products  and we may be required to compensate the contract manufacturers with respect to their non cancelable purchase orders for such inventory 
the amount shown in the table above represents our estimate of inventory held by contract manufacturers that we could be required to purchase within the next months 
we do not expect any such required purchases to exceed our requirements for inventory to meet expected sales of our products to our customers 
under our customer service  it outsourcing agreements and research and development agreement we are subject to service level commitments and contractor commitments levels providing for annual minimum payments that vary depending on the levels we choose 
the amounts shown in the table above represent the amounts that would be payable  based on current levels  through the expiration of the agreements

proceeds from maturities and sales of municipal and corporate bonds and government agency instruments were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and proceeds from the sales of equity investments totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal we have selectively made strategic investments in privately held companies and in limited partnership venture capital funds  which in turn invest in privately held companies 
these investment activities are entered into with the intention of complementing our business strategies and research and development efforts  and may include a strategic commercial or technology relationship  such as a component supply agreement or technology license arrangement  with these privately held companies 
we made capital calls on existing investments of million in fiscal and have committed to make additional capital contributions to venture capital funds totaling million 
we are contractually obligated to provide funding upon calls for capital 
the expiration dates for such capital calls are generally five to eight years from the inception of the fund  and the amounts and timing of such calls during that period are at the discretion of the funds general partners 
we estimate that we will pay approximately million over the next months as capital calls are made 
in june we agreed to sell all of our limited partnership interests  subject to general partner approvals  which  when closed  would generate cash of approximately million and eliminate our future capital call requirements 
in july  we agreed to sell our santa clara  ca land and facilities for estimated net proceeds of approximately million  subject to customary closing conditions 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  which includes no repurchases of shares in fiscal on march   our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program providing for expenditures of up to million through march  under the new stock repurchase program  we may repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to million in the open market  in privately negotiated 
table of contents transactions with shareholders or using derivate transactions  provided  however  that all repurchases must be pre approved by the audit and finance committee of the board of directors

the owners of h c  com and huawei  have agreed on a return of capital to shareholders of million 
this is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year  subject to chinese regulatory approval  and will result in a million reduction in cash and a related decrease in the minority ownership liability to huawei due to the cash payment to huawei 
on august   we announced that we will begin negotiations with huawei for the purchase by us of an additional equity interest in h c 
we currently own of h c and huawei owns 
under the terms of our existing shareholders agreement  and as previously disclosed  we each have the right  commencing on and after november   to initiate a bid process to purchase the equity interest in h c held by the other 
the negotiations are intended to result in an agreement outside of the bid process 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms with huawei or that the transaction will be consummated at all 
we may need to raise equity or debt capital in order to finance any such transaction  and such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may also use existing cash to finance a portion of the consideration for any such transaction  which  if used  would reduce available cash on hand 
effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements for additional information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
our short term investments consist mainly of fixed income securities with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels as of may   the fair value of our short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we currently have the ability and intention to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
if necessary  we may sell short term investments prior to maturity to implement management strategies and meet our liquidity needs 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on corporate financial results by hedging existing foreign currency exposures and anticipated foreign currency transactions expected to occur within one month 
anticipated foreign currency transaction exposures with a maturity profile in excess of one month may be selectively hedged 
translation exposures are not hedged 
due to the limitations on converting renminbi  we are limited in our ability to engage in currency hedging activities in china 
although the impact of currency fluctuations of renminbi to date has been slight  fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 

table of contents gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical ten percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently we believe that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity security price risk 
we hold publicly traded equity securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would not have had a material impact on our financial statements as of may
