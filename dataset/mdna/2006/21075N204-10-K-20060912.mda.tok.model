item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview contango is a houston based  independent natural gas and oil company 
the company s core business is to explore  develop  produce and acquire natural gas and oil properties primarily offshore in the gulf of mexico and in the arkansas fayetteville shale 
contango operators  inc coi  our wholly owned subsidiary  acts as operator on certain offshore prospects 
the company also owns a interest in a limited partnership formed to develop an lng receiving terminal in freeport  texas  and holds investments in companies focused on commercializing environmentally preferred energy technologies 
revenues and profitability 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil and on our ability to find  develop and acquire natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable and the completion and successful operation of our freeport lng project 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved natural gas and oil reserves 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas and oil activities 
reserve replacement 
generally  our producing properties in the arkansas fayetteville shale and offshore in the gulf of mexico have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
as a result  we must locate and develop or acquire new natural gas and oil reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire natural gas and oil reserves 
sale of proved properties 
from time to time as part of our business strategy  we have sold  and in the future may continue to sell some or a substantial portion of our proved reserves to capture current value  using the sales proceeds to further our exploration  lng and alternative energy investment activities 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include estimates of remaining proved natural gas and oil reserves and the timing and costs of our future drilling  development and abandonment activities 
please see risk factors on page for a more detailed discussion of a number of other factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the results of our operations for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  revenues 
all of our revenues are from the sale of our natural gas and oil production 
our revenues may vary significantly from year to year depending on changes in commodity prices and production volumes

natural gas and oil production and average sales prices 
our net natural gas production for the year ended june  was approximately mmcf d  down from approximately mmcf d for the year ended june  net oil production for the period was down from barrels of oil per day to barrels of oil per day 
the decrease in natural gas and oil production was primarily the result of the property sale effective april   the property sale to an independent oil and gas company effective february   and the sale of our south texas natural gas and oil interests to edge petroleum effective july  for the year ended june   prices for natural gas and oil were per mcf and per barrel  compared to per mcf and per barrel for the year ended june  for the year ended june   our net natural gas production was approximately mmcf d  down from approximately mmcf d for the year ended june  net oil production for the period was down from barrels of oil per day to barrels of oil per day 
these decreases primarily were due to normal

as a result  some of our former south texas properties were eligible for severance tax reduction 
comparable low levels of severance taxes should not necessarily be expected in future reporting periods 
the million credit for severance taxes was attributable to previously paid severance taxes from our south texas properties  which we sold in december to edge petroleum

cash outflow 
during the year ended june   we invested a total of million consisting of million in exploration and development activities million offshore and million onshore 
we drilled a total of three offshore wells  one of which was successful drilling and completion costs of million  and two of which were dry holes drilling costs of million 
we also invested million in the acquisition of additional offshore interests  million to purchase additional ownership interests in rex and coe  million in our owned freeport lng project and million in alternative energy companies 
capital budget 
for fiscal year  our capital expenditure budget calls for us to invest a total of million  as we anticipate significantly increasing our capital commitment for developing our arkansas fayetteville shale play  drilling our eugene island dutch exploration well  and bringing our grand isle liberty discovery to production

we have not yet identified the offshore prospects we intend to drill during the remainder of fiscal year  but in the event we have exploration success at our dutch prospect  our capital budget will be significantly increased as we will incur additional costs to complete the well and pay for production facilities in addition to follow on development wells 
in addition  depending on how we choose to develop our grand isle discovery  our capital budget could be further increased 
of the million fiscal year capital expenditure budget  million is expected to be invested in onshore activities 
in the arkansas fayetteville shale  our partners and we have acquired or received commitments on approximately  net mineral acres and we have received afes and committed to a total of wells in this play as of august  of these wells  are operated by alta and are operated by a third party independent oil and gas exploration company integrated wells 
we have an average working interest of  and a net revenue interest of in these wells 
of the alta wells  one well was drilled during fiscal year we are budgeting to receive an additional six afes from alta for wells to be drilled during fiscal year  and therefore expect to drill alta wells during fiscal year at a cost of million 
this includes drilling  frac  completion and hookup costs for the wells 
additionally  we expect to invest million in infrastructure  seismic and additional leasehold costs for the arkansas fayetteville shale 
we estimate we will have an average working interest of  and a net revenue interest of in these alta wells 
of the integrated wells for which we have received an afe  wells are producing  wells have already been spud  and wells have yet to be drilled 
in addition to these integrated wells  we are budgeting to receive additional afes for integrated wells during the remainder of fiscal year for a total of integrated wells 
we anticipate having between to producing integrated wells by december our capital budget for integrated wells assumes we will invest million in integrated wells during fiscal year  assuming we drill the wells currently budgeted

as of august   we have approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we have million in long term debt outstanding and million of unutilized borrowing capacity available 
the company has estimated production during august of approximately mmcfe d 
we will need additional financing to fund our offshore exploration and arkansas fayetteville shale development programs 
we intend to access our additional funding needs by first seeking a hydrocarbon borrowing base bank loan 
depending on the terms  conditions and amount of traditional bank financing made available to us  we may be further required to pursue mezzanine debt  equity financing  the sale of assets or seek other financing to fund our opportunities 
the availability of such funds will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors over which we have no control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves certain assumptions  judgments  choices and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
thus  the application of these principles can result in varying results from company to company 
contango s critical accounting principles  which are described below  relate to the successful efforts method for costs related to natural gas and oil activities  consolidation principles and stock based compensation  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
reclassifications 
certain reclassifications have been made to the and financial statements to conform to the presentation 
these reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income or cash flows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom see supplemental oil and gas disclosures and the mark to market valuation of the fund see note contango venture capital corporation of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil produced are recognized upon the passage of title  net of royalties 
revenues from natural gas production are recorded using the sales method 
when sales volumes exceed the company s entitled share  an overproduced imbalance occurs 
to the extent the overproduced imbalance exceeds the company s share of the remaining estimated proved natural gas reserves for a given property  the company records a liability 
at june  and  the company had no over or under produced imbalances 
cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid investment grade debt investments having an original maturity of days or less 
as of june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents  of which  was invested in highly liquid aaa rated tax exempt money market funds 
as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments 
as of june   the company had  invested in a portfolio of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements periodic auction reset par securities  which have coupons that periodically reset to market interest rates at intervals ranging from to days 
these par securities are being classified as short term investments and consist of aaa rated tax exempt municipal bonds 
par securities are highly liquid and have minimal interest rate risk 
as of june   the company had  invested in par securities 
net income loss per common share 
basic and diluted net income loss per common share have been computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing income loss attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock 
see note net income loss per common share to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the calculations of basic and diluted net income loss per common share 
income taxes 
the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of i temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and ii operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based upon management s estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period 
concentration of credit risk 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable result from natural gas and oil sales or joint interest billings to a limited number of third parties in the natural gas and oil industry 
this concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact the company s overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
consolidated statements of cash flows 
for the purpose of cash flows  the company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
significant transactions may occur which do not directly affect cash balances and  as such  are not disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
certain such non cash transactions are disclosed in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity  including shares issued as compensation and issuance of stock options 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amounts of the company s short term financial instruments  including cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable  approximate their fair values based on the short maturities of those instruments 
the company s long term debt was variable rate debt and  as such  approximated fair value  as interest rates are variable based on prevailing market rates 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred  where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged through income 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and all development costs are capitalized 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  and any such impairment is charged to expense in the period 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the results are determined 
if proved reserves are not discovered  the exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
other exploratory costs  such as seismic costs and other geological and geophysical expenses  are expensed as incurred 
the provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization is based on the capitalized costs as determined above 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is on a cost center by cost center basis using the unit of production method  with lease acquisition costs amortized over total proved reserves and other costs amortized over proved developed reserves 
when circumstances indicate that proved properties may be impaired  the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows on a cost center basis to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on the company s estimate of future natural gas and oil prices and operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  then the capitalized cost is reduced to fair market value 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
generally  the application of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas property results in lower capitalized costs and higher expenses compared to similar companies applying the full cost method of accounting 

table of contents 
index to financial statements on july   the company changed its accounting policy for amortizing and impairing the company s natural gas and oil properties from a well by well cost center basis to a field by field cost center basis 
management believes this policy is preferable in providing greater comparability with other successful efforts natural gas and oil companies by conforming to predominant industry practice 
in addition  the field level is consistent with the company s operational and strategic assessment of its natural gas and oil investments 
the company determined that the cumulative effect of the change in accordance with apb opinion no 
was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas  the company classified its million property sale effective april   its property sale to an independent oil and gas company for million  effective february   and its property sale to edge petroleum corporation edge petroleum for million  effective july   as discontinued operations 
an integral and on going part of our business strategy is to sell our proved reserves from time to time in order to generate additional capital to reinvest in our onshore and offshore exploration programs 
thus  it is our intent to remain an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration  production  and acquisition of natural gas and oil 
principles of consolidation 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of contango oil gas company and its subsidiaries and affiliates  after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions 
wholly owned subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
exploration and development subsidiaries not wholly owned  such as owned rex  owned moe  and owned coe  each as of june   are not controlled by the company and are proportionately consolidated 
by agreement  rex  moe and coe have disproportionate allocations of their profits and losses among the owners 
accordingly  the company determines its income or losses from the ventures based on a hypothetical liquidation determination of how increases or decreases in the book value of the ventures net assets will ultimately affect the cash payments to the company in the event of dissolution 
by agreement  since the company was the only owner that contributed cash to rex  moe  and coe upon formation of these three ventures  the company consolidated of the ventures net assets and results of operations until the ventures expended all of the company s initial cash contributions 
subsequent to that event  the owners share in the net assets of the ventures is based on their stated ownership percentages 
by agreement  the owners in coe immediately share in the net assets of coe  including the company s initial cash contribution  based on their stated ownership percentages 
the other owners of rex  moe and coe who participated in the initial formation of these entities  contributed seismic data and related geological and geophysical services to the ventures in exchange for ownership interests 
on september   the company purchased an additional ownership interest in each of rex and coe 
both interests were purchased from an existing owner  which prior to the sale  owned of each of the two subsidiaries 
as a result of these two purchases  the company s equity ownership interest in rex has increased from to and in coe from to 
on september   an independent third party also purchased a interest in each of rex and coe and the selling owner s ownership interest thus decreased from to in each such entity 
contango s limited partnership interest in freeport lng is accounted for at cost 
as a limited partner  the company has no ability to direct or control the operations or management of the general partner 
contango s ownership in ccpm and contango s limited partnership interest in contango capital partners  lp ccplp are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method  only contango s investment in and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
ccplp formed the fund in january the fund owns equity interests in a portfolio of alternative energy companies 
the fund marks these equity interests to market according to fair market values on a quarterly basis 
contango s investments in trulite  moblize and gridpoint are accounted for using the cost method 
under the cost method  contango records an investment in the stock of an investee at cost  and recognizes dividends received as income 
dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions of cost of the investment

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas and oil production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas and crude oil 
prices received for natural gas and oil are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
for the year ended june   a fluctuation in the prices received for natural gas and oil production would have had an approximate million impact on our revenues 
interest rate risk 
we have long term debt subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in interest rates 
as of august   we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding due in april this variable rate obligation exposes us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be less than million
