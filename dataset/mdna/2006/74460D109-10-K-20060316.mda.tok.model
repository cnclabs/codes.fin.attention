overview the self storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and has increased over the past several years due to additional development of self storage facilities as well as the expansion of the containerized storage business by competitors 
we believe that the increase in competition has had a negative impact on our occupancy levels and rental rates in many markets 
however  we believe that we possess several distinguishing characteristics that enable us to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
we are the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the united states with direct and indirect ownership interests as of december  in  self storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of our facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  our self storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving us national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes us as one of the dominant providers of self storage space in most markets in which we operate and enables us to use a variety of promotional activities  such as television advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals  which are generally not economically viable to most of our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
we will continue to focus our growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of our existing self storage properties  ii acquiring self storage properties owned and operated by others  iii expanding and repackaging our existing self storage facilities  iv developing new self storage locations  and v participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc psb 
major elements of these strategies are as follows o we will focus on enhancing the operating performance of our self storage properties  primarily through increases in revenues achieved through the telephone reservation center and associated marketing efforts  as well as management of expense growth 
see self storage operations same store facilities for further discussion 
we expect future increases in rental income to come primarily from increases in rental rates  as opposed to improvements in occupancies  although there can be no assurance 
o we will acquire facilities from third parties 
during and  we acquired interests in self storage facilities from third parties at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in addition  between january  and march   we acquired three additional self storage facilities from third parties total net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million and we currently are under contract to purchase seven self storage facilities total net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we believe that our national telephone reservation system and our marketing and promotional activities present an opportunity to increase revenues at these facilities through higher occupancies  as well as cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
o we will look to expand and further invest into our existing self storage locations by i improving their visual and structural appeal  ii expanding our facilities density  at a per square foot cost that is favorable compared to a ground up development  to take advantage of increases in local demand since the facilities were developed  and iii converting existing vacant space previously used by our containerized storage operations into traditional self storage space 
during   and  we have invested a total of approximately million in such expansion  conversion  and repackaging activities 
at december   we have a pipeline of such projects to expand or repackage our existing facilities  and to convert substantially all of the remaining vacant space previously used by our containerized storage operations  for an aggregate of approximately million  which will add approximately  net rentable square feet 
completion of these projects is subject to contingencies  including obtaining governmental agency approvals 
we continue to evaluate our existing real estate portfolio to identify additional expansion and repackaging opportunities 
o in and  our rate of development of new self storage facilities has declined due to increases in construction cost  increases in competition with retail  condominium  and apartment operators for quality self storage sites in urban locations  and more difficult zoning and permitting requirements 
we will  however  continue to seek favorable sites and markets for development 
during the five years ending december   the company and the consolidated development joint venture developed and opened a total of storage facilities with total costs of approximately million 
in  we opened six facilities with an aggregate cost of million 
at december   we have a development pipeline which includes four self storage facilities that are expected to cost an aggregate of approximately million  which we expect will open over the next months 
o through our investment in psb  we will continue to participate in the potential growth of this company s investment in approximately million net rentable square feet of commercial space at december  the acquisition of interests in facilities that we have an ownership interest in and operate has historically comprised a significant component of our growth 
the pool of such available acquisitions has continued to decrease as we have acquired such remaining interests over the years  including million in such acquisitions in the potential remaining acquisition opportunities principally include the remaining that we do not own in the properties owned by the other investments in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  with a book value of approximately million as well as the other partnership interests in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  with a book value of approximately million 
accordingly  we do not expect such acquisitions to comprise a significant component of our growth going forward 
we have entered into an agreement to acquire shurgard storage centers  inc shurgard  a publicly held reit that has interests in approximately self storage facilities located in the united states and europe 
under the agreement  and based upon our december  balance sheet and shurgard s september  balance sheet included in its related form q  i we would issue shares of our common stock for each share of shurgard common stock which would increase our common shares outstanding from  to approximately  shares  ii we would assume shurgard debt which totals approximately billion at september   increasing our debt outstanding assuming no prepayment from million to approximately billion  and iii million of shurgard preferred stock would be redeemed 
the transaction is targeted to close by the end of the second quarter of completion of the transaction is not assured and is subject to risks  including that shareholders of either public storage or shurgard do not approve the transaction or that the other closing conditions are not satisfied 
in addition  shurgard may under limited circumstances terminate the agreement to take a superior proposal 
public storage and shurgard are not aware of any significant governmental approvals that are required for consummation of the merger 
if any approval or action is required  it is presently contemplated that public storage and shurgard would use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval 
there can be no assurance that any approvals  if required  will be obtained 
the foregoing description of the terms of our agreement to acquire shurgard does not purport to be complete  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement  a copy of which is filed with our current report on form k dated march  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on the company s financial presentation 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
qualification as a reit income tax expense we believe that we have been organized and operated  and we intend to continue to operate  as a qualifying real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code and applicable state laws 
a qualifying reit generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders  and accordingly  we do not pay income tax on the share of our taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders 
we therefore do not estimate or accrue any federal income tax expense 
this estimate could be incorrect  because due to the complex nature of the reit qualification requirements  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  we cannot be assured that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a reit for any particular taxable year 
for any taxable year that we fail or have failed to qualify as a reit and applicable relief provisions did not apply  we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income  whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders 
any resulting requirement to pay corporate income tax  including any applicable penalties or interest  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief 
impairment of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of long lived assets  including real estate  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and on a quarterly basis evaluate other long lived assets for impairment 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment entails valuation of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated  which involves significant judgment in the area of projecting earnings  determining appropriate price earnings multiples  and discount rates 
in addition  the evaluation of other long lived assets for impairment requires determining whether indicators of impairment exist  which is a subjective process 
when any indicators of impairment are found  the evaluation of such long lived assets then entails projections of future operating cash flows  which also involves significant judgment 
we identified impairment charges in the years ended december  and  related to our plan to close and consolidate certain containerized storage facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
future events  or facts and circumstances that currently exist  that we have not yet identified  could cause us to conclude in the future that other long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
estimated useful lives of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of depreciable  long lived assets 
we record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon their estimated useful lives 
any change in the estimated useful lives of those assets  caused by functional or economic obsolescence or other factors  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimated level of retained risk and unpaid tenant claim liabilities as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we retain certain risks with respect to property perils  legal liability  and other such risks 
in addition  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company reinsures policies against claims for losses to goods stored by tenants in our self storage facilities 
in connection with these risks  we accrue losses based upon the estimated level of losses incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on recommendations from an independent actuary that is a member of the american academy of actuaries 
while we believe that the amounts of the accrued losses are adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
accruals for contingencies we are exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that have occurred  but in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we have not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable or because we are not aware of the event 
future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
some of these potential losses  of which we are aware  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for operating expenses we accrue for property tax expense and certain other operating expenses based upon estimates and historical trends and current and anticipated local and state government rules and regulations 
if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect  our expenses could be misstated 
cost of operations  interest expense  general and administrative expense  as well as television  yellow page  and other advertising expenditures are expensed as incurred 
results of operations net income net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in  representing an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily due to improved net operating income before depreciation from our same store  newly developed and acquired self storage facilities  reduced minority interest in income  increased gains on the disposition of real estate assets and higher interest income 
these items were partially offset by increases in depreciation associated with acquisition and development activities  general and administrative expense  and interest expense 
net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in  representing an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily due to improved net operating income before depreciation from our same store self storage facilities  acquired and newly developed self storage facilities  combined with a decrease in income allocable to minority interests based upon ongoing distributions as a result of our restructuring of million of our series n preferred partnership units 
these factors are partially offset by an increase in the allocation of income to minority interest of  attributable to the restructuring of preferred partnership interests  increased general and administrative expense attributable primarily to increased stock based compensation expense and reduced gains from the sale of discontinued real estate facilities 
allocations of income among shareholders in computing the net income allocable to common shareholders for each period  we have deducted from net income i distributions paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a totaling  in  and  in each of  and  ii distributions paid to our preferred shareholders totaling  in   in  and  in  and iii amounts allocated to preferred shareholders in connection with preferred stock redemption activities as described below  totaling  in   in and  in net income per share net income was per diluted common share for compared to per diluted common share for this increase was attributable to the factors denoted above with respect to net income offset partially by an increase in income allocated to preferred shareholders  as described above  and an increase in diluted shares outstanding from  in to  in the increase in shares outstanding was due primarily to the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock options 
net income was per common share  on a diluted basis  for compared to per common share for this increase was attributable to the factors denoted above with respect to net income offset partially by an increase in income allocated to preferred shareholders  as described above  and an increase in diluted shares outstanding from  in to  in the increase in shares outstanding was due primarily to the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock options 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  we have approximately  in higher coupon preferred stock that becomes available for redemption during while there is no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital and at appropriate rates to redeem these securities  if we do redeem these securities  we expect allocations to our preferred shareholders based upon distributions paid to decrease 
however  during there would be an additional allocation to the preferred shareholders of approximately million per common share  based upon weighted average shares during if these redemptions are completed 
real estate operations self storage operations our self storage operations are by far the largest component of our operating activities  representing approximately of our revenues generated during rental income with respect to our self storage operations has grown from  in to  in  representing an increase of  or approximately 
the year over year improvements in rental income are due to improvements in the performance of those facilities that we owned throughout each of the three years  and the addition of new facilities to our portfolio  either through our acquisition or development activities 
to enhance year over year comparisons  the following table summarizes  and the ensuing discussion describes  the self storage operating results

self storage operations same store facilities at december   we owned  self storage facilities that we have operated at a stabilized level of operations throughout the three year period 
these same store facilities contain approximately million net rentable square feet  representing approximately of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our consolidated self storage portfolio

b square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire fiscal year 
c realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income  net of discounts by the weighted average occupied square footage for the year 
realized rents per square foot take into consideration promotional discounts  credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due 
d annualized revenue per available square foot revpaf represents rental income  net of discounts divided by total net rentable square feet 
e in place annual rent per occupied square foot represents contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts 
rental income increased approximately in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher average realized annual rental rates per occupied square foot  which were higher in as compared to our occupancy levels remained flat on a year over year basis at approximately for each period 
rental income increased by in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot combined with a increase in weighted average square foot occupancy in as compared to throughout  and  we continued advertising through the use of television commercials and we offered various promotional discounts in order to improve both our occupancy levels and rental rates 
we believe that continued growth in rental income for these same store facilities will come primarily from continued increases in rental rates charged to our tenants as opposed to improvements in occupancy levels 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of self storage facilities with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months 
we believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer 
our primary goal is to continue to grow rental income in a consistent and sustainable manner 
growth in rental income will depend upon various factors  including our ability to i maintain high occupancy levels  ii increase rental rates charged to both new and existing customers  and iii reduce the amount of promotional discounts to attract new tenants 
in this regard  we are continuously evaluating call volume  reservation activity and move in move out rates relative to our marketing activities and rental rates 
when warranted we will adjust our pricing  promotional discounts  and media strategies to accommodate changing conditions in each market in which we operate 
we believe that our same store facilities are well positioned for continued rental income growth going into at december   our existing tenants were paying rental rates that were higher than one year earlier 
this improvement  however  was partially offset by a slight reduction in occupancy of 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our goal of sustainable growth in our rental income  while sustaining our occupancy levels 
cost of operations excluding depreciation increased by in as compared to this increase was modest relative to increases we have experienced over the last several years  due to reductions in telephone reservation center costs and payroll expense described below 
in  depreciation expense increased  due primarily to the impact of additional capital expenditures 
cost of operations increased by in as compared to this increase was attributable primarily to an increase in direct property payroll due to higher incentives and other compensation to property operating and management personnel  as well as an increase in other cost of management due primarily to increased recruiting and training expenses and information technology costs 
in  depreciation expense declined  due to assets becoming fully depreciated relative to new capital expenditures 
the underlying compensation to our personnel has increased in  and  as our field organization has focused upon improving customer service and productivity 
however  over the last few years we have bolstered our safety programs and improved our workers compensation claims management skills 
these efforts are having a positive impact on reducing workers compensation claims  and have reduced the level of liability for future claims during this resulted in a significant reduction in workers compensation expense in  resulting in a decrease in overall payroll expense in while we believe that there will be additional workers compensation expense reductions to be achieved in  principally through reductions in the ongoing level of claims incurred  the level of reduction will be lower than that achieved in advertising and promotion is comprised principally of media television and radio  yellow page  and internet advertising 
we experienced an increase of in and in in advertising and promotion expense 
yellow page advertising has stayed relatively stable in each of the periods 
our internet advertising expenditures  though still a relatively small portion of our overall expenditures  have grown from virtually none in to  in and  in media advertising  principally television  has increased from  in to  in and  in we expect that internet advertising will continue to grow as that marketing channel becomes a more important source of new tenants  and that yellow page advertising will remain relatively stable 
future media advertising expenditures are not determinable at this time  and will be driven in part by demand for our self storage spaces as well as our evaluation of the most effective mix of yellow page  media  and internet advertising 
repairs and maintenance has increased throughout   and  as we have endeavored to improve the curb appeal and rent ready condition of our facilities 
repairs and maintenance also includes snow removal costs  which declined in as compared to  but increased in as compared to we expect to see a moderate increase in repairs and maintenance expenditures in telephone reservation center costs were  in   in  and  in these declines have resulted from reduced call volume  as well as improvements in staffing efficiencies that have occurred throughout and we believe that the expense represents the stabilized level of expenditures for our telephone reservation center given the current number of self storage facilities in our portfolio and the related call volume 
property insurance expense was relatively flat in as compared to  however  it declined in as compared to this reduction was due to improved cost controls as well as a somewhat softer insurance market allowing us to get improved premiums on our policies 
we expect that property insurance will increase in as a result of the adverse impact that the recent hurricanes had on the insurance industry 
overall  our operating expense growth was more moderate in than we anticipated 
we believe this will change in and return to a to year over year growth  excluding advertising expenditures

the southern california market consists principally of the greater los angeles area and san diego  and has historically been a source of strong growth due to its diverse economy and continued population growth 
in addition  barriers to entry in the form of difficult permitting requirements tend to reduce the potential for increased competition in the infill locations where we focus our operations 
the northern california market consists principally of san francisco and related peripheral areas 
while this area has a vibrant economy and relatively strong population growth  it has been subject to general economic conditions  principally issues associated with the technology sector 
in addition  there has been increased competition in the areas that we do business  principally in the peripheral areas near san francisco  due to new supply 
as a result  revenue growth in this area has been average relative to our other markets 
the texas market principally includes dallas  houston and san antonio 
this market has historically been subject to volatility due to minimal regulatory restraint upon building  which results in cycles of overbuilding and absorption 
for the last few years  we have been in a period of increased supply and competition in the areas we operate  and as a result revenue growth has been below expectations 
the florida market principally includes miami  orlando  tampa  and west palm beach 
these markets have been our strongest in terms of revenue growth in  due in part to increased moving and storage demand resulting from hurricane damage 
in addition  over the longer term we believe that this market benefits from continued strong population growth and barriers to entry 
accordingly  we expect this market to continue to perform at the upper end relative to our other markets 
the illinois market is composed principally of chicago 
revenue growth has been weak in chicago due  we believe  to increased competition from building that is comprised principally of conversions of industrial type facilities into self storage facilities  as well as weaker population growth 
georgia  which includes principally atlanta  has been benefiting from a reduction in new supply relative to population growth in the last few years and  as a result  revenue growth has been favorable in the last three years 
we believe that these conditions should continue and expect atlanta to be one of our strongest markets in self storage operations acquired facilities during and  we acquired self storage facilities containing  net rentable square feet no facilities were acquired during

d during  we expanded one of the acquisitions  adding  net rentable square feet at a cost of  the and acquisitions were acquired at various dates throughout each respective year 
accordingly  rental income  cost of operations  net operating income and weighted average square foot occupancy levels represent the operating results for the partial period that we owned the facilities during the year acquired 
during  we acquired a total of self storage facilities for an aggregate cost of approximately  these facilities contain in the aggregate approximately  net rentable square feet and are located principally in the buffalo  dallas  miami  milwaukee  and minneapolis metropolitan areas 
during  we acquired a total of self storage facilities  principally in single property transactions  for an aggregate cost of  these facilities contain in the aggregate approximately  net rentable square feet and are located principally in the atlanta  chicago  miami  and new york metropolitan areas 
we believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the united states enhances our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities and capitalize on the overall fragmentation in the storage industry 
our and acquisitions consist of facilities that have been operating for a number of years as well as newly constructed facilities that were in the process of filling up to stabilized occupancy levels 
in either case  we have been able to leverage off of our operating strategies and improve the occupancy levels of the facilities  or with respect to the newly developed facilities we have been able to accelerate the fill up pace 
we expect that our and acquisitions will continue to provide earnings growth during as these facilities continue to improve their occupancy levels as well as realized rental rates 
in addition  during we expect to continue to acquire additional self storage facilities 
between january  and march   we acquired three self storage facilities from third parties with total net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million  comprised of cash totaling million and the assumption of debt totaling million 
at march   we are under contract to purchase seven self storage facilities total approximate net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we anticipate that these acquisitions will be funded entirely by us 
each of these contracts is subject to significant contingencies  and there is no assurance that any of these facilities will be acquired 
self storage operations expansion facilities our expansion facilities consist of self storage facilities that we have owned for a number of years and have recently expanded the amount of square footage available for rent combined with eight self storage facilities located in new orleans that were heavily impacted by hurricane katrina during the self storage facilities are generally older facilities that are located in prime locations where we have added additional space by either constructing new buildings on available land at the existing site or by demolishing existing single story buildings and rebuilding multi story buildings in their place 
the operating results of these expansion facilities and the eight facilities located in new orleans are not comparable on a year over year basis 
the operating results for these facilities are presented in the table below

b occupied and available square footage excludes the impact of units taken offline due to hurricane damage  where such amounts are factored in to the computations of weighted average square foot occupancy  weighted average realized rent per occupied square foot  and in place annual rent per occupied square foot 
c realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income  net of discounts by the weighted average occupied square footage for the year 
realized rents per square foot take into consideration promotional discounts  credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due 
d in place annual rent per occupied square foot represents contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts 
e square footage excludes  net rentable containerized storage space initially developed for the containerized storage business at december   but includes square footage taken offline due to hurricane damage 
all of the new orleans facilities were closed for operations for several weeks following the hurricane  however  all but three of these facilities have since reopened 
the five that are operating are not operating at full capacity  as many units are unavailable for lease due to damage 
two of the three facilities that remain closed will not be able to reopen at all without substantial restoration and repair work 
for the years ended december   and  net operating income before depreciation for these eight facilities was   and  respectively 
with respect to the two facilities that have been significantly damaged and should remain inoperable for the foreseeable future  net operating income before depreciation for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
notwithstanding that five of our facilities in new orleans are currently operating  we believe that the indirect economic effects of the hurricane on the city may have a negative impact on our facilities operating results  and these effects are expected to continue for an indeterminate time period 
we expect that the expansion facilities  other than the new orleans facilities  will continue to provide growth to our earnings into as we continue to rent the newly added vacant space 
the weighted average occupancy level of these facilities was   and for each of the three years ended december   and respectively 
we expect that we will continue to repackage additional facilities during at december   we have seven projects with an aggregate cost of million to convert the containerized storage space into self storage space  and other expansion and repackaging projects to enhance the visual appeal of our facilities or increase their net rentable space at an aggregate cost of million 
these activities will increase our self storage space by an aggregate of  net rentable square feet and will result in short term dilution to earnings 
however  we believe that expansion of our existing self storage facilities in markets that have unmet storage demand  and improving our existing facilities competitive position through enhancing their visual and structural appeal  provide an important means to improve the company s earnings 
further  the construction cost for these expansions is generally lower on a per square foot basis than the development of a new facility  resulting in a higher yield potential 
there can be no assurance about the future level of such expansion and enhancement opportunities  and these projects are subject to contingencies 
self storage operations developed facilities we have newly developed self storage facilities  and facilities that were developed to contain both self storage and containerized storage at the same location combination facilities that have not been operating at a stabilized level of operations since january  at december   these newly developed facilities have an aggregate of  net rentable square feet of self storage space  and  net rentable square feet of industrial space developed originally for our containerized storage business 
aggregate development cost for these facilities was approximately million at december  the operating results of the self storage facilities and combination facilities are reflected in the self storage operations table under the caption  developed facilities 
these facilities are not included in the same store portfolio because their operations have not been stabilized 
the following table sets forth the operating results and selected operating data with respect to the developed facilities developed self storage facilities year ended december  year ended december  change change amounts in thousands  except per square foot amounts and facility count rental income self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in      self storage facilities opened in       self storage facilities opened in and       combination facilities       total rental income       cost of operations excluding depreciation a self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in     self storage facilities opened in      self storage facilities opened in and     combination facilities     total cost of operations       net operating income before depreciation a self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in   self storage facilities opened in      self storage facilities opened in and       combination facilities       net operating income before depreciation       depreciation       net operating income       weighted average square foot occupancy during the period self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in and combination facilities weighted average realized rent per occupied square foot during the period b self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in and combination facilities in place annual rent per occupied square foot at december c self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in and combination facilities developed self storage facilities continued year ended december  year ended december  change change amounts in thousands  except per square foot amounts and facility count number of facilities self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in and combination facilities square footage self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in self storage facilities opened in and     combination facilities d     cumulative development cost self storage facilities opened in   self storage facilities opened in     self storage facilities opened in      self storage facilities opened in and      combination facilities d       a cost of operations before depreciation and net operating income before depreciation are included herein because we believe they provide important measures for evaluating our ongoing operations 
b realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income  net of discounts by the weighted average occupied square footage for the year 
realized rents per square foot take into consideration promotional discounts  credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due 
c in place annual rent per occupied square foot represents contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts 
d square footages exclude industrial space developed for containerized storage activities totaling  net rentable square feet at december  during  and  we have converted industrial space no longer used by the discontinued containerized storage business into  net rentable square feet of traditional self storage space  at an aggregate cost of  unlike many other forms of real estate  we are unable to pre lease our newly developed facilities due to the nature of our tenants 
accordingly  at the time a newly developed facility first opens for operation the facility is entirely vacant generating no rental income 
historically  we estimated that on average it takes approximately months for a newly developed facility to fill up and reach a targeted occupancy level of approximately 
as these facilities approach the targeted occupancy level of approximately  rates are increased  resulting in further improvement in net operating income as the existing tenants  which moved in at lower rates  have their rates increased or are replaced by tenants at higher rates 
this process of reaching stabilized rental rates can take approximately another to months following the time when the facilities reach a stabilized occupancy level 
in addition  move in discounts have a more pronounced effect upon realized rental rates for the newly developed facilities  because such facilities tend to have a higher ratio of newer tenants 
property operating expenses are substantially fixed  consisting primarily of payroll  property taxes  utilities  and marketing costs 
the rental revenue of a newly developed facility will generally not cover its property operating expenses excluding depreciation until the facility has reached an occupancy level of approximately to 
however  at that occupancy level  the rental revenues from the facility are still not sufficient to cover related depreciation expense and cost of capital with respect to the facility s development cost 
during construction of the self storage facility  we capitalize interest costs and include such cost as part of the overall development cost of the facility 
once the facility is opened for operations interest is no longer capitalized 
the yield on cost for these facilities for the year ended december   based on net operating income before depreciation  was approximately  which is lower than our ultimate yield expectations 
we expect these yields to increase as these facilities reach stabilization of both occupancy levels and realized rents 
properties that were developed before have contributed greatly to our earnings growth with net operating income before depreciation increasing by approximately million in as compared to this growth was primarily due to higher occupancy levels in as compared to we expect that these facilities will continue to provide growth  however  at a growth rate that is much lower than experienced in as occupancy levels become more stabilized 
with respect to our combination facilities  we have been steadily converting these facilities into entirely self storage facilities by converting the industrial space once used by our containerized storage operations into self storage space 
as of december   of the combination facilities have been converted into entirely self storage 
we expect to convert the remaining three facilities over the next two years 
weighted average occupancy levels for the combination facilities was in  in  and in the drop in occupancy in is due principally to the addition of more space during development of self storage facilities causes short term earnings dilution because  as mentioned above  of the extended time to stabilize a self storage facility 
we believe that development of self storage facilities is favorable  despite the short term earnings dilution  because it is advantageous for us to continue to expand our asset base and benefit from the resulting increased critical mass  with facilities that will improve our portfolio s overall average construction and location quality 
however  the development environment has changed in the last few years due to increases in construction costs  increases in competition with retail  condominium  and apartment operators for quality construction sites in urban locations  and more difficult zoning and permitting requirements  which has reduced the number of attractive sites available for development and reduced our development of facilities 
it is unclear when  or if  these conditions will improve 
we expect that over at least the next months  the developed self storage facilities will continue to have a negative impact to our earnings 
furthermore  the newly developed facilities in our development pipeline described in liquidity and capital resources acquisition and development of facilities that will be opened for operation over the next months will also negatively impact our earnings until they reach a stabilized occupancy level 
commercial property operations commercial property operations included in our consolidated financial statements include commercial space owned by the company and entities consolidated by the company 
we have a much larger interest in commercial properties through our ownership interest in psb 
our investment in psb is accounted for on the equity method of accounting  and accordingly our share of psb s earnings is reflected as equity in earnings of real estate entities  see below 
our commercial operations are comprised of  net rentable square feet of commercial space  operated principally at certain of the self storage facilities 
as noted below  we sold a commercial facility during the operating results for this facility prior to its disposition are included in discontinued operations below 
the results of our commercial operations are provided in the table below commercial property operations excluding discontinued operations year ended year ended december  december  change change dollar amounts in thousands rental income     cost of operations excluding depreciation a     net operating income before depreciation a     depreciation expense     net operating income     a cost of operations before depreciation and net operating income before depreciation are included herein because we believe they provide important measures for evaluating our ongoing operations 
our commercial property operations consist primarily of facilities that are at a stabilized level of operations  and generally reflect the conditions in the markets in which they operate 
we do not expect any significant growth in net operating income from this segment of our business for containerized storage operations commencing in  we significantly curtailed the scope and number of facilities of our containerized storage operations  and continue to evaluate additional facilities for closure 
at december   we operated containerized storage facilities located in major markets in which we have significant traditional self storage market presence 
the operations with respect to the facilities that were closed or consolidated in   and the closed facilities  including historical operating results for previous periods  are not included in the table below and instead are included in discontinued operations on our income statement 
the following table sets forth the operations of these facilities containerized storage excluding discontinued operations year ended december  year ended december  change change dollar amounts in thousands rental and other income       cost of operations excluding depreciation a direct operating costs      facility lease expense     total cost of operations       net operating income prior to depreciation a       depreciation expense b      net operating income      a cost of operations before depreciation and net operating income before depreciation are included herein because we believe they provide important measures for evaluating our ongoing operations 
b depreciation expense principally relates to the depreciation related to the containers  however  depreciation expense for  and includes   and  respectively  related to real estate facilities 
rental and other income includes monthly rental charges to customers for storage of the containers and certain non core services  which were eliminated 
rental and other income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in and  for  primarily as a result of the termination of these non core services 
at december   there were approximately  occupied containers at the facilities 
direct operating costs principally includes payroll  equipment lease expense  utilities and vehicle expenses fuel and insurance 
the reduction in direct operating costs during  when compared to  is due primarily to the aforementioned termination of non core services 
cost of operations increased in  as compared to  due principally to increases in yellow page and media advertising expense totaling  in and  in  partially offset by a decrease in expenses attributable to the termination of the non core services in compared to future yellow page and media advertising may change in response to demand  occupancy levels  and our determination of the most appropriate marketing mix for this product 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate level of the containerized storage business s expansion  level of gross rentals  level of occupancy or profitability 
we continue to evaluate the business operations  and additional facilities may be closed 
see discontinued operations below for a discussion of operating results of the closed facilities 
ancillary operations our ancillary operations include the operating results of our tenant insurance  truck rental  merchandise  and third party property management operations 
the following table sets forth our ancillary operations year ended december  year ended december  change change dollar amounts in thousands revenues tenant reinsurance premiums      merchandise sales      truck rentals      property management     total revenues       cost of operations tenant reinsurance       merchandise sales      truck rentals     property management total cost of operations       net operating income tenant reinsurance      merchandise sales      truck rentals   property management     total net operating income       tenant reinsurance operations on december   we acquired psic from a related party 
ps insurance reinsures policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self storage facilities 
revenues are comprised of fees charged to tenants electing such policies 
cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third party insurers described below  as well as claims adjusting expenses 
throughout   and  we had outside third party insurance coverage for claims paid exceeding  resulting from any individual event  to a limit of  effective january   such coverage was revised to cover claims paid exceeding  resulting from any individual event  to a limit of  the decrease in cost of operations for as compared to is due principally to improved claims handling and claims management 
in addition  in  we recorded an estimated loss of approximately  with respect to potential tenant insured losses as a result of several hurricanes affecting the southeastern united states 
during  we determined that this accrual was too high based upon claims history  and accordingly we reduced the estimated liability by approximately  and reduced cost of operations in by a corresponding amount 
similarly in  we recorded estimated losses of approximately million relating to potential tenant insured claims for losses incurred as a result of hurricanes occurring in other amounts included in cost of operations for claims losses during   and are isolated to events affecting specific properties or tenants  rather than catastrophic events 
the future level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon the number of new tenants electing to purchase policies  premiums charged for such insurance  and existing tenant retention to continue participating in the insurance program 
for the years ended december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our self storage tenant base had such policies 
the future cost of operations will be dependent primarily upon the level of losses incurred  including the level of catastrophic events  such as hurricanes  that occur and affect our properties 
the aforementioned increase in the deductible of  per event could result in higher loss expense in  depending upon the number of catastrophic losses that occur 
merchandise and truck rental operations through a taxable reit subsidiary  all of our self storage facilities sell locks  boxes  and packing supplies to our tenants as well as the general public 
revenues and cost of operations for these activities are included in the table above as merchandise sales 
in addition  at selected locations  our subsidiary maintains trucks on site for rent to our self storage customers and the general public on a short term basis for local use 
in addition  we also act as an agent for a national truck rental company to provide their rental trucks to customers for long distance use 
the revenues and cost of operations for these activities are included in the table above as truck rentals 
these activities generally serve as an adjunct to our self storage operations providing our tenants with goods and services that they need in connection with moving and storing their goods 
the revenues and expenses of these activities have remained relatively stable through the three years ended december    and the primary factors impacting the level of operations of these activities is the level of customer and tenant traffic at our self storage facilities  including the level of move ins 
property management operations we manage self storage facilities on behalf of third party owners and self storage facilities that are owned by the unconsolidated entities  affiliates of the company 
under the supervision of the property owners  we coordinate rental policies  rent collections  marketing activities  the purchase of equipment and supplies  maintenance activities  and the selection and engagement of vendors  suppliers  and independent contractors 
we also assist and advise the property owners in establishing policies for the hire  discharge  and supervision of employees for the operation of these facilities 
our operating income from these activities is generally dependent upon the revenues earned at the managed facilities  because our management fee is based upon revenues 
management contracts with the third party owners can be terminated by either party upon days written notice 
equity in earnings of real estate entities in addition to our ownership of equity interests in psb  we had general and limited partnership interests in eight limited partnerships at december  psb and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the unconsolidated entities 
due to our limited ownership interest and limited control of these entities  we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and account for such investments using the equity method 
equity in earnings of real estate entities for the year ended december  consists of our pro rata share of the unconsolidated entities based upon our ownership interest for the period

psb s earnings increased in the year ended december  as compared to  due to increased same park operating results  an increased gain on sale of real estate  and reduced eitf topic d charges associated with redemptions of preferred securities  offset partially by higher depreciation expense associated with property acquisitions 
psb s earnings decreased in the year ended december  as compared to  due to impairment charges  increased eitf topic d charges associated with redemptions of preferred securities  and increased depreciation expense associated with significant property acquisitions 
equity in earnings of psb represents our pro rata share approximately throughout   and of the earnings of ps business parks  inc  a publicly traded real estate investment trust american stock exchange symbol psb organized by the company on january  as of december   we owned  common shares and  operating partnership units units which are convertible into common shares on a one for one basis in psb 
at december   psb owned and operated million net rentable square feet of commercial space located in eight states 
accordingly  our future equity income from psb will be dependent entirely upon psb s operating results

in january  we entered into a joint venture partnership with an institutional investor for the purpose of acquiring up to million of existing self storage properties in the united states from third parties the acquisition joint venture 
the acquisition joint venture is funded entirely with equity consisting of from us and from the institutional investor 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   our pro rata share of earnings with respect to two of the facilities acquired directly by the acquisition joint venture are reflected in equity in earnings in the table above 
these two facilities were acquired by the acquisition joint venture directly from third parties at an aggregate cost of  our investment with respect to these two facilities was approximately  our future equity in earnings with respect to the acquisition joint venture will be dependent upon the level of earnings generated by these two properties owned by the acquisition joint venture 
the other investments includes our equity in earnings with respect to our pro rata share of earnings with respect to seven limited partnerships  for which we held an approximately consistent level of equity interest during the three years ended december  these limited partnerships were formed by the company during the s 
the company is the general partner in each limited partnership  and manages each of these facilities for a management fee that is included in ancillary operations 
the limited partners consist of numerous individual investors  including the company  which throughout the s acquired units of limited partnership interests in these limited partnerships in various transactions 
our future earnings with respect to the other investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the self storage facilities that these entities own 
the operating characteristics of these facilities are similar to those of our self storage facilities  and are subject to the same operational issues as the same store facilities as discussed above with respect to self storage operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the operating results of these entities for the years ended december  and other income and expense items interest and other income interest and other income increased in as compared to  and in compared to  due primarily to higher interest income attributable to higher average cash balances and higher average interest rates on short term cash investments 
as discussed more fully in liquidity and capital resources below  at december   we had cash balances totaling approximately million 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we issued approximately million of our series h cumulative preferred stock 
the net proceeds from this issuance and our december  cash balances will be used primarily to fund future development  acquisition  and preferred redemption activities see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in the interim  the net proceeds from our cash balances is expected to earn interest income currently at approximately at december  relative to the corresponding divided requirement approximately with respect to our series h cumulative preferred stock 
this difference will result in an estimated reduction to earnings per common share 
in addition  we may issue additional preferred stock during the early part of  raising the necessary funds in anticipation of the potential redemption of approximately  in higher rate preferred stock that becomes available for redemption in september and october these issuances similarly will have a negative impact on earnings per share until the proceeds are utilized 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in  and  in included in depreciation expense with respect to our real estate facilities was  in   in  and  in the increase from to is due to the acquisition and development of additional real estate facilities 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization with respect to real estate facilities for as compared to is due primarily to a reduction in depreciation with respect to maintenance capital expenditures  offset partially by an increase in depreciation with respect to newly developed and acquired facilities 
depreciation and amortization during with respect to real estate facilities acquired or developed during amounted to  which was for a partial period for the time they were acquired until december   and we expect the annual depreciation expense with respect to these facilities for and forward will approximate  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in  and  in general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes  investor relation expenses  and corporate and executive salaries  including employee stock based compensation expense 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes expenses that vary depending upon our activity levels in certain areas  such as overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities  employee severance  and product research and development expenditures 
the increase in general and administrative expense from to is primarily due to higher employee stock based compensation expense relating to our stock option and restricted stock plans which resulted in expenses of  in as compared to  in the increase in general and administrative expense from to is also primarily due to higher employee stock based compensation expense which for amounted to  for total restricted stock and stock option expense  exclusive of payroll taxes on the exercise of options  should approximate million based upon options and restricted stock outstanding at december  grants of restricted stock units and stock options after december  could further increase our future stock based compensation expense 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in  and  in the increase in interest expense in compared to was caused by the assumption of mortgage notes payable in connection with property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of  interest expense with respect to debt due a joint venture partner  interest expense paid to a related party in and a decrease in capitalized interest due to lower average in process development balances 
during the later part of  we assumed mortgage notes payable with an aggregate principal balance of million and having an average interest rate of approximately in connection with property acquisitions 
we incurred interest expense with respect to these mortgage notes of  in for the partial period these notes became our liabilities 
interest expense with respect to these mortgage notes totaled  in  representing a year over year increase of  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  on december   we sold seven self storage facilities to the acquisition joint venture for an aggregate of million in cash 
in january  we sold an interest in three additional self storage facilities to the acquisition joint venture for an aggregate of million in cash 
our joint venture partner s equity interest in these ten facilities has been accounted for as a financing arrangement and has been included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  and as debt to joint venture partner 
our partner s pro rata share of net income with respect to these facilities has been classified as interest expense  which for totaled  none for 
based upon the balance outstanding at december   interest expense should be approximately  with respect to our debt to joint venture partner 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  during we incurred interest expense totaling  with respect to debt due a related party 
this debt was extinguished on november  capitalized interest expense totaled  in   in  and  in in connection with our development activities

income has been allocated to our preferred partnership interests based upon i ongoing distributions  representing distributions paid during the period and ii redemptions of preferred units representing the differences between the redemption amount and the carrying amount of preferred partnership units that have been redeemed 
the reduction in income allocated to preferred partnership interests for ongoing distributions and for redemptions are due to the following issuances and redemptions of our preferred units o in march  we redeemed our series n preferred units million and our series o preferred units million for cash 
we allocated  to the minority interests  reflected as allocations associated with redemptions with respect to these redemptions in accordance with eitf topic d  representing the excess of the stated amount of the preferred units over their carrying amount 
this reduced annual ongoing distributions following the redemption by approximately o in december  we issued  of our series z preferred units in connection with a property portfolio acquisition 
this increased annual ongoing distributions following issuance by approximately  o on march   certain investors who held million of our series n cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units agreed  in exchange for a special distribution of  to a reduction in the distribution rate on their preferred units from per year to per year  and an extension of the call date for these securities to march  the investors also received their distribution that accrued from january  through the effective date of the exchange 
the  special distribution  combined with  representing the excess of the stated amount of the preferred units over their carrying amount  is reflected above in redemptions 
this transaction reduced ongoing annual distributions after march  by approximately million 
in november  we formed a development joint venture the consolidated development joint venture with a joint venture partner psac storage investors  llc whose partners included a third party institutional investor and mr 
hughes  the company s chairman  to develop approximately million of self storage facilities and to purchase million of our equity stock  series aaa see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on august   we acquired the institutional investors interest in psac investors  llc 
as part of the acquisition  we also obtained and subsequently exercised the right to acquire mr 
hughes interest in psac investors  llc which we acquired november  as a result of these events i we ceased allocating income to minority interests with respect to the consolidated development joint venture effective august   and ii mr 
hughes interest in the consolidated development joint venture was classified as debt on our balance sheet and income with respect to mr 
hughes interest in the consolidated development joint venture for the period from august  through november   has been classified as interest expense on our income statement 
the acquired minority interests reflect interests in the consolidated entities  other than the consolidated development joint venture  that we acquired throughout the three years ended december  and are therefore no longer outstanding 
there will be no further income allocated to these interests in and beyond 
discontinued operations as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  between january  and december   we implemented a business plan that included the closure of all but of our containerized storage facilities 
in  we sold five self storage facilities exiting entirely the knoxville  tennessee and perrysville  ohio markets 
in  we sold one of our commercial facilities located in west palm beach  florida 
in  in an eminent domain proceeding  one of our self storage facilities located in portland  oregon was condemned

the following table summarizes our ability to fund distributions to the minority interest  capital improvements to maintain our facilities  and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities 
the remaining cash flow generated is available to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt and for reinvestment

our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
we expect to fund our growth strategies with cash on hand at december   internally generated retained cash flows  proceeds from issuing equity securities or as the case with the planned merger with shurgard storage centers  inc see below the issuance of our common stock for shares of shurgard 
in general  our current strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital  either common or preferred equity 
we have in the past used our million line of credit as temporary bridge financing and repaid those amounts with internally generated cash flows and proceeds from the placement of permanent capital 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our million bank line of credit 
over the past three years  we have funded substantially all of our acquisition and development activities with permanent capital 
we have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt 
we have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i under the reit structure  a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders  making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone  ii our perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  iii after the end of a non call period  we have the option to redeem the preferred stock at any time  which enabled us to effectively refinance higher coupon preferred stock with new preferred stock at lower rates  iv preferred stock does not contain onerous covenants  thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility  and v dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to our reit distribution requirements 
our credit ratings on each of our series of cumulative preferred stock are baa by moody s and bbb by standard poor s 
our portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   we had borrowings under mortgage notes totaling million which encumbers facilities with a book value of million and unsecured debt in the amount of million 
we also have debt to joint venture partner amounting to million with respect to ten real estate facilities with an aggregate book value of million 
recent issuance of preferred stock and projected redemption of preferred securities one of our financing objectives over the past several years has been to reduce our average cost of capital with respect to our preferred securities 
accordingly  we have redeemed higher rate preferred securities outstanding and have financed the redemption with cash on hand or from the proceeds from the issuance of lower rate preferred securities 
we believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital when appropriate 
since the beginning of through december   we have raised approximately billion of our cumulative preferred stock  and used approximately million of these net proceeds in order to redeem higher coupon preferred securities 
on january   we redeemed our series q cumulative preferred stock totaling million 
this redemption was funded with cash on hand 
in addition to the series q preferred noted above  we currently have approximately million of additional preferred securities that become redeemable at our option in  as follows 
earliest redemption dividend liquidation security date rate value s series r preferred stock  series s preferred stock  total securities available for redemption through  from time to time  we may raise additional capital primarily through the issuance of lower rate preferred securities  in advance of the redemption dates to ensure that we have available funds to redeem these securities 
the timing and our ability to issue additional preferred securities are dependent on many factors 
there is no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital and at appropriate rates to redeem these securities 
also in january  we issued  depository shares  each representing  of a share  of our cumulative preferred stock  series h  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
requirement to pay distributions we have operated  and intend to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  we will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders  provided that at least of our taxable income is so distributed to our shareholders prior to filing of the company s tax return 
we have satisfied the reit distribution requirement since aggregate dividends paid during totaled million to the holders of our cumulative preferred stock  million to the holders of our common stock and million to the holders of our equity stock  series a 
although we have not finalized the calculation of our taxable income  we believe that the aggregate dividends paid in to our shareholders enabled us to continue to meet our reit distribution requirements 
we estimate that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to our cumulative preferred stock outstanding at march   and assuming the redemption of the preferred securities mentioned above  will be approximately million 
during  we paid distributions totaling million with respect to our preferred partnership units 
we estimate the distribution requirements with respect to the preferred partnership units outstanding at december   to be approximately million 
for  distributions with respect to the common stock and equity stock  series a will be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders 
we anticipate that  at a minimum  quarterly distributions per common share will remain at per common share 
for the first quarter of  a quarterly distribution of per common share has been declared by our board of directors 
with respect to the depositary shares of equity stock  series a  we have no obligation to pay distributions if no distributions are paid to the common shareholders 
to the extent that we do pay common distributions in any year  the holders of the depositary shares receive annual distributions equal to the lesser of i five times the per share dividend on the common stock or ii 
the depositary shares are non cumulative  and have no preference over our common stock either as to dividends or in liquidation 
capital improvement requirements during  we have budgeted approximately million for capital improvements 
capital improvements include major repairs or replacements to the facilities  which keep the facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal 
capital improvements do not include costs relating to the development or expansion of facilities 
debt service requirements we do not believe we have any significant refinancing risks with respect to our notes payable and debt to joint venture partner 
except for the debt to joint venture partner all such debt is fixed rate 
at december   we had total outstanding debt of approximately million 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for approximate principal maturities of such borrowings 
we anticipate that our retained operating cash flow will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make scheduled principal payments 
it is our current intent to fully amortize our debt as opposed to refinance debt maturities with additional debt 
acquisition and development of facilities during  we will continue to seek to acquire additional self storage facilities from third parties  however  it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake 
for  we do not anticipate that our acquisition joint venture will fund additional acquisitions from third parties  and we expect that additional acquisitions and development will be funded entirely by the company 
between january  and march   we acquired three additional self storage facilities from third parties total net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million comprised of cash totaling million and the assumption of debt totaling million 
these acquisitions were funded entirely by us 
as of march   we are under contract to purchase seven self storage facilities total approximate net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we anticipate that these acquisitions will be funded entirely by us 
each of these contracts is subject to significant contingencies  and there is no assurance that any of these facilities will be acquired 
we currently have a development pipeline of self storage facilities and expansions to existing self storage facilities with an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million unaudited 
approximately million of development cost has been incurred as of december  the development and fill up of these storage facilities is subject to significant contingencies such as obtaining appropriate governmental approvals 
we estimate that the amount remaining to be spent of approximately million will be incurred over the next months 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our development pipeline

during  we repurchased  shares for approximately million 
during  we repurchased  shares for approximately million 
from the inception of the repurchase program through december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
planned merger with shurgard storage centers  inc 
we have entered into an agreement to acquire shurgard  a publicly held reit that has interests in approximately self storage facilities located in the united states and europe 
under the agreement  and based upon our december  balance sheet and shurgard s september  balance sheet included in its related form q  i we would issue shares of our common stock for each share of shurgard common stock which would increase our common shares outstanding from  to approximately  shares  ii we would assume shurgard debt which totals approximately billion at september   increasing our debt outstanding assuming no prepayment from million to approximately billion  and iii million of shurgard preferred stock would be redeemed 
the transaction is targeted to close by the end of the second quarter of completion of the transaction is not assured and is subject to risks  including that shareholders of either public storage or shurgard do not approve the transaction or that the other closing conditions are not satisfied 
in addition  shurgard may under limited circumstances terminate the agreement to take a superior proposal 
public storage and shurgard are not aware of any significant governmental approvals that are required for consummation of the merger 
if any approval or action is required  it is presently contemplated that public storage and shurgard would use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval 
there can be no assurance that any approvals  if required  will be obtained 
we would also be acquiring shurgard s international operations in europe  which consist principally of facilities that have been completed in the last few years and are in various stages of fill up 
shurgard s international operations have not been profitable  and there is no assurance they will ultimately be profitable 
we have limited experience in international operations  which may adversely impact our ability to operate profitably in europe 
in connection with the proposed acquisition of shurgard s european operations  we will be evaluating various strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to  public or private offerings of securities  one or more possible joint ventures  and possible asset acquisitions and or sales 
shurgard s outstanding borrowings on its lines of credit million at september  would become payable immediately upon completion of the merger 
in addition  there would be additional cash costs related to the merger  cash requirements for the redemption of million of shurgard s preferred stock on the merger date  and additional possible cash requirements following the merger 
our current cash on hand and available borrowing capacity on our existing line of credit will be insufficient to fund these immediate capital requirements 
we are currently evaluating several financing alternatives  including  but not limited to  expanding the borrowing capacity of our line of credit  obtaining short term bridge financing  and raising additional capital through the issuance of preferred or common securities 
we would generally look to repay incremental borrowings  including principal payments with respect to the debt assumed as a result of the merger  with retained operating cash and capital raised through the issuance of either preferred or common securities 
the foregoing description of the terms of our agreement to acquire shurgard does not purport to be complete  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement  a copy of which is filed with our current report on form k dated march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to limit our exposure to market risk  we principally finance our operations and growth with permanent equity capital consisting either of common stock  preferred stock or retained operating cash flow 
at december   our debt  including preferred stock called for redemption  as a percentage of total shareholders equity based on book values was 
our preferred stock is not redeemable at the option of the holders 
except under certain conditions relating to the company s qualification as a reit  the preferred stock is not redeemable by the company prior to the following dates series r september   series s october   series t january   series u february   series v september   series w october   series x november   series y january   series z march   series a march   series b june   series c september   series d february   series e april   series f august   series g december  and series h january  on or after the respective dates  each of the series of preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at per depositary share or share in the case of the series y  plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date 
our market risk sensitive instruments include notes payable  which totaled  at december  all of our notes payable bear interest at fixed rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for terms  valuations and approximate principal maturities of the notes payable as of december  as mentioned in management s discussion and analysis of results of operations liquidity and capital resources above  we have entered into an agreement to acquire shurgard 
this transaction  if completed  would result in our assumption of the following areas of market risk o foreign currency risk shurgard has a significant amount of debt in its european operations  and a significant investment in its european operations 
as a result  changes in foreign currency rates could have a significant impact on their results of operations and liquidity 
o interest rate risk million at september  of shurgard s debt represents line of credit borrowings that would become payable immediately upon completion of the merger 
in addition  there would be additional cash costs related to the merger  cash requirements for the redemption of million of shurgard s preferred stock on the merger date  and additional possible cash requirements following the merger 
accordingly  our short term borrowings could increase  which may be at variable rates of interest 
as a result  changes in interest rates could in the future have a significant impact upon our level of interest expense
