part i item business introduction for over a half century  blonder tongue has been a designer  manufacturer  and supplier of products for the cable television industry 
until the past few years  the emphasis has been to maintain a dominant position in the market niche of private cable systems 
however  as the distinction between the private and franchise cable markets has become blurred  the company has widened its strategic thrust to accommodate both markets 
the company has evolved from a manufacturer of electronics equipment to a provider of voice  video and data integrated network solutions 
in the private cable market  products are sold to customers servicing multiple dwelling units mdu s  the lodging industry  and institutions such as hospitals  prisons  schools and marinas 
now the company also supplies products to customers servicing the single family dwelling franchise cable market 
both the private and franchise cable markets are reacting quickly to the surging demand for integrated systems which accommodate video  high speed data internet  and telephony 
this is happening as cable companies add high speed data transmission and telephony to their product offerings  and as telephone companies move toward supplying a broader range of services ie video and high speed data transmission 
these market initiatives by both cable and telephone companies  provide opportunities for blonder tongue 
in addition to its core product line of head end and distribution products  over the past several years the company has added fiber communications network components  qpsk to qam transcoders for echostar and digicipher satellite systems  digicipher compatible set top converters  and a broad range of interdiction products 
the company has also introduced psk to qam transcoders for satellite delivered high definition television hdtv  an hdtv processor for over the air vsb hdtv channels and a qam modulator 
the company is a value added distributor for motorola s qam decoder to the united states private cable and canadian franchise cable markets 
this  coupled with the qtm transcoder line  provides a low cost hardware solution for small system operators that want to offer digital programming from sources such as hits and echostar 
the company s transcoder line has been further enhanced to include the high definition transcoder modules which are intended for use with dish commercial tv from echostar as well as it s hdtv processor for delivery of off air hdtv signals over the systems distribution network 
blonder tongue recently introduced the lighthouse series of fiber to the home ftth products which provide a standards based delivery system for mdu s  gated communities  and small municipalities 
this product series employs passive optical network architecture  which provides the operator with serviceability by requiring no active equipment between the headend and the customer 
through one single mode fiber  the system delivers substantial bandwidth to each subscriber 
this is a low cost solution for the operator to provide ftth that is compatible with video on demand  ip video  and other applications of interest to the consumer 
internet protocol television iptv is an emerging technology which allows viewers to access broadcast network channels  subscriber services  and movies on demand 
although this technology is in its infancy  the market projections are impressive with an estimated million homes worldwide subscribing to iptv services by the company is currently negotiating license agreements that will provide entry into this promising market 
this technology is already experiencing full scale commercialization in international markets such as hong kong  italy  and france 
on november   blonder tongue and its recently formed  wholly owned subsidiary  blonder tongue far east  llc  a delaware limited liability company  entered into a joint venture agreement joint venture agreement with master gain international industrial limited master gain  a hong kong corporation  to manufacture products in the people s republic of china the prc 
this joint venture the joint venture was formed to compete with far east manufactured products and to expand market coverage outside north america 
the joint venture has identified a manufacturing facility in the prc for acquisition and anticipates acquiring this facility and commencing production of certain products sometime in the second half of to date  the joint venture has formed a british virgin island entity which is owned fifty percent by each of the joint venture parties  however  the wholly owned foreign subsidiary in the prc that will acquire and operate the manufacturing facility has not yet been formed and the joint venture parties have not completed the capitalization of the joint venture 
the joint venture anticipates that the formation of the wholly owned subsidiary and funding of the joint venture will occur in the near future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview for a more detailed description of the joint venture agreement with master gain 
ultimately  the company believes that if the joint venture is successful  the manufacture of its core products in the prc  while penetrating the franchised cable market in the far east  will afford the company the opportunity to leapfrog the competition  and will reduce the company s manufacturing cost allowing a more aggressive marketing program in the private cable market 
provide the opportunity to acquire chinese companies with technology in the hybrid fiber coax hfc transmission  the iptv core passive component and high speed data fields  all with very attractive manufacturing costs 
facilitate the company s ability to sell to private and franchised cable operators in the pacific rim  particularly in the prc 
provide access to advanced technologies from multiple companies primarily located in israel and the prc that are not capable of exploiting the same due to financial constraints or due to the inability to competitively produce such products for distribution in the large markets represented by the us and the far east 
the first of these products is the coresma cmts product which is being acquired by the joint venture and is now manufactured by the company 
on february  the effective date  the company entered into a series of agreements related to its megaport line of high speed data communications products 
as a result of these agreements  the company has expanded its distribution territory  favorably amended certain pricing and volume provisions and extended by years the term of the distribution agreement for its megaport product line 
these agreements also require the company to guaranty the payment by shenzhen junao technology company ltd 
shenzhen  an affiliate of master gain  to octalica  ltd 
octalica  in connection with shenzhen s purchase of tmt third millennium technology limited tmt from octalica 
in exchange for this guaranty  the company obtained an assignable option the option having a term of one year  extendable on notice for an additional days to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of tmt on substantially the same terms of the acquisition by shenzhen from octalica 
the purchase price for tmt and  therefore  the amount and payment terms guaranteed by the company is the sum of  plus an earn out 
the earn out will not exceed of the net revenues derived from the sale of certain products during a period of months commencing after the sale of certain specified quantities of tmt inventory following the effective date 
the cash portion of the purchase price is payable i  on the th day following the effective date  ii  on the last day of the twenty fourth month following the effective date  and iii  commencing upon the later of a the second anniversary of the effective date and b the date after which certain volume sales targets for each of the megaport products have been met  and then only as and to the extent that revenues are derived from sales of such products 
the company anticipates that it will either exercise the option or will assign the option to the joint venture or one or more of the joint venture s affiliates for exercise  prior to the expiration thereof 
over the past several years  the company has acquired a private cable system bdr broadband  llc and has acquired an interest in a company offering private telephone services suited to multiple dwelling unit applications 
bdr broadband  a owned subsidiary of the company  acquired the rights of entry for certain mdu cable television and high speed data systems 
the systems are presently comprised of approximately  existing mdu cable television subscribers and approximately  passings 
the minority interest in bdr broadband is owned by priority systems  llc  which has expertise in marketing and operating mdu cable television systems 
the company believes its model for acquiring and operating private cable systems has been successful and can be replicated 
during the past year  the company acquired rights of entry for approximately additional passings to offer cable television and or high speed data services 
overall  the company has increased its subscribers and passings from  and  as of the end of to  and  as of the end of the company is seeking opportunities to acquire additional rights of entry and is presently negotiating several of these opportunities 
the company entered into a series of agreements in march and september to acquire a economic interest in netlinc communications  llc and blonder tongue telephone  llc to which the company has licensed its name 
as a result  the company is now involved in providing a proprietary telephone system ideally suited to mdu development 
the company is entitled to receive incremental revenues associated with direct sales of telephony products and may receive additional revenue from telephone services provided to customers 
revenues derived from sales of these telephony products and services have not been material to date 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in november and completed its initial public offering in december strategy staying at the forefront of the communications broadband technology revolution is a constant challenge 
the company has continued to add products to respond to the changes taking place in the market 
over the past few years  in order to provide product and services that allow integrators to deploy triple play services of voice  data and video both analog and digital  the company has added digital tv transcoders  qam set top boxes  two high speed data product lines one docsis based and a primary telephone equipment line for mdu s 
more recently  the company introduced a fiber to the home product line  hdtv headend products and a qam modulator 
in response to the pressure to compete with far east manufactured products and to expand its market coverage outside north america  the company has entered into a joint venture to manufacture and market its products in the peoples republic of china 
such products would also be sold in the united states 
the company believes that this chinese initiative will reduce the manufacturing costs of its products  with resultant improvement in gross profit margins  provide the opportunity to acquire competitive chinese tv technology  add to its product coverage and allow the company to sell to the cable markets in the pacific rim  particularly in the prc 
the company anticipates that the joint venture will commence production of products in the prc during the second half of the company s principal customers are cable system integrators both franchise and private cable operators  as well as contractors that design  package  install and in most instances operate  upgrade and maintain the systems they build 
the company has historically enjoyed  and continues to enjoy  a dominant market position in the private cable industry  while progressively making inroads into the franchise cable market 
as the company has expanded its market coverage  however  the distinctions between private cable and franchise cable have become blurred 
for example  the most efficient  highest revenue producing private cable systems and small franchise cable systems are built with the same electronic building blocks 
most of the electronics required for these systems are available from blonder tongue 
the continuing evolution of the company s product lines headend and distribution is necessary to maintain the ability to provide all of the electronic equipment needed to build small cable systems and much of the equipment needed in larger systems for the most efficient operation and highest profitability in high density applications 
industry overview the broadband signal distribution industry involving the high speed transmission of television  telephony and internet signals has been dominated by franchise multiple system cable operators  or msos 
the penetration of wireless  direct broadcast satellite dbs  such as directv and dish network  in the tv market continues to grow with a combined subscriber count in excess of million 
the regional telephone operators ie verizon and at t compete with the mso s for high speed data services 
and  now verizon and at t are building fiber optic networks capable of delivering triple play services nationally direct to the home or to the curb utilizing packet based  internet protocol  technology ip 
the mso s are deploying ip for their video on demand vod services and continue to expand the reach of fiber to maintain their dominant position 
the long term result of these activities is increased competition for the provision of all three services and a trend toward delivery of these services through fiber using ip technology 
it is not known how long this transition will take but to remain competitive  the company must continue to increase its product offerings for fiber transmission  ip encoding and decoding and fiber to the home applications 
cable television most cable television operators have built fiber optic networks with various combinations of fiber optic and coaxial cable to deliver television signal programming  data  and phone services on one drop cable 
cable television deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in most existing systems 
the system architecture being employed to accomplish the combined provision of television  high speed data and telephone service is a hybrid fiber coaxial hfc network 
in an hfc network  fiber optic trunk lines connect to nodes which typically feed to subscribers  using coaxial cable 
delivery of vod services incorporates ip technology to update the file servers in the systems  which deliver vod programs 
the company believes that most major metropolitan areas will eventually have complex networks of two or more independent operators interconnecting homes  while private cable operators will provide service to many multi dwelling complexes 
all of these networks are potential users of blonder tongue headend  digital  telephone and interdiction products 
multiple dwelling units mdus mdus  because they represent a large percentage of the private cable market  have historically been responsible for a high percentage of the company s sales 
in the early days of cable television mdus were served by franchise cable operators 
new private cable systems deploy lower cost dedicated headends and by supplying all three services video  voice and high speed data  have substantially greater revenues per subscriber  thereby improving the return on investment over what was possible years ago 
a typical private cable mdu provides to channels of analog signals  as many as digital video channels  high speed data and telephone services  utilizing the company s core headend products receivers  modulators  transcoders  processors  etc  primary telephone equipment and distribution products 
lodging competition among private cable integrators serving the lodging market to provide more channels  video on demand  and enhanced interactivity  has resulted in increased demand for television system electronics 
these systems have been and continue to be well received in the market  as property owners have sought additional revenues and guests have demanded increased in room conveniences 
the leading system integrators in this market rely upon outside suppliers for their system electronics and most are blonder tongue customers 
these companies and others offer lodging establishments systems that provide true video on demand movies with a large selection of titles 
to meet these demands  the typical lodging system headend will include as many as to receivers and as many as to modulators  and will be capable of providing the guest with more free channels  video on demand for a broad selection of movie titles  and interactive services such as remote check out and concierge services 
most of the systems with video on demand service were initially in large hotels  where the economics of high channel capacity systems are more easily justified 
the conversion of hotel pay per view systems into video on demand is increasing 
smaller hotels and motels are being provided with video on demand as enhanced technology results in reduced headend costs  keeping the market growth reasonably steady 
a current trend in lodging is to provide plug and play high speed data service to customers and blonder tongue s megaport high speed data product is an ideal solution for hotel motel high speed data deployment 
international cable television service for much of the world is expanding as technological advancement reduces the cost to consumers 
in addition  economic development in latin america and asia has allowed construction of integrated delivery systems that utilize a variety of electronics and broadband hardware 
the pace of growth is difficult to predict  but as more alternatives become available and television service becomes increasingly affordable  it is anticipated that more equipment will be placed in the field 
the company utilizes several distributors in florida and within latin america to serve the latin american market  although during the last several years international sales have not materially contributed to the company s revenue base 
the recently announced joint venture to manufacture products in the prc will focus on selling to the large customer base in the pacific rim  while expanding the company s capability to manufacture core products at a more competitive cost 
in connection with any expansion  however  there are inherent risks of international operations in general  and operating in the prc in particular 
these risks are described in more detail under risk factors below 
additional considerations the technological revolution with respect to video  data and voice services continues at a rapid pace 
cable tv s qam video is competing with directv and echostar s dbs service  cable modems compete with dsl offered by the regional bell operating companies rboc  rboc s are building national fiber networks and are now beginning to deliver video  data and voice services directly to the home over fiber optic cable  and voice over ip voip is being offered by cable companies and others in competition with traditional phone companies 
the company is also beginning to see the convergence of data and video communications  wherein computer and television systems merge 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty which technology will be dominant at any particular point in time  the company believes that delivery of services using ip technology will eventually dominate the delivery systems of the future and the tremendous bandwidth available through the use of fiber optic cable will eventually be the dominant carrier of video  voice and data communications signals 
since united states television sets are for the most part analog not digital  direct satellite television  digitally compressed programming and ip delivery requires headend products or set top decoding receivers or converters to convert the transmitted signals back to analog 
the replacement of all television sets with digital sets will be costly and take many years to complete 
the company believes that for many years to come  program providers will deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers television sets using headend products at some distribution point in their networks or employ decoding receivers at each television set 
products blonder tongue s products can be separated  according to function  into the several categories described below analog video headend products used by a system operator for signal acquisition  processing and manipulation for further transmission 
among the products offered by the company in this category are satellite receivers  integrated receiver decoders  demodulators  modulators  antennas and antenna mounts  amplifiers  equalizers  and processors 
the headend is like the brain of a television signal distribution system 
it is the central location where the multi channel signal is initially received  converted and allocated to specific channels for analog distribution 
in some cases  where the signal is transmitted in encrypted form or digitized and compressed  a receiver will also be required to decode the signal 
blonder tongue is a licensee of motorola  inc s motorola videocipher and digicipher encryption technologies and integrates their decoders into integrated receiver decoder products  where required 
the company estimates that analog video headend products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in digital video headend products used by a system operator for acquisition  processing and manipulation of digital video signals 
an alternative to converting signals to analog for distribution is to transcode the satellite signal s modulation from qpsk quadrature phase shift key to qam quadrature amplitude modulation or psk to qam for hdtv signals received from a satellite transponder  since qpsk and psk are optimum for satellite transmission and qam is optimum for fiber coaxial distribution 
this maintains the signal in its digital form and saves precious system bandwidth 
digital products continue to expand in the cable marketplace and bring more advanced technology to consumers and operators 
blonder tongue is constantly expanding its digital products offering  which includes a complete line of transcoders for economically deploying and adding a digital programming tier  including both standard and hdtv programming  digital qam up converters for data over cable applications and digital high definition television processors for delivery of hdtv programming and qam modulators 
high speed data products used to provide internet access and transfer data over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable system 
products in this category include standard docsis cable modems  docsis euro docsis cmts cable modem termination system  and the megaport solution for providing broadband internet access to hospitality environments mdus 
the megaport solution consists of two main components  the gateway and the intelligent outlets 
the gateway is a broadband ethernet router or bridge that establishes a network within a building or community over the existing coaxial cable system 
the intelligent outlet serves as the modem  but is permanently installed in the location to eliminate loss of equipment associated with churn 
each gateway can accommodate enabled outlets and with a software upgrade  up to outlets 
this is a relatively new category of products for the company and has not as yet contributed significantly to the company s revenues 
telephony products used to provide expanded telephone service to mdu subscribers 
these products are designed to offer carrier class telephone service to residences using existing twisted pair wires 
service will be fully transparent to subscribers with advanced calling features such as  caller id  call waiting plus  and three way calling available and bundled at a flat rate to subscribers 
the blonder tongue telephony family of products includes a t concentrator and a multiplexer 
the system starts at a telephone company class switch located at their local central office 
a t line is routed from the switch and brought to the loopxpress concentrator 
the telephone information is then routed to the linexpress multiplexer which converts the digital format into analog voice frequencies for transmission to up to independent resident telephone lines 
the existing twisted pair telephone wiring infrastructure is utilized to provide dial tone at a resident s premises using any standard telephone 
system operation  including activating and deactivating phone lines  is achieved through a point and click software package 
communication to the equipment can be performed locally or remotely for increased operating efficiency and simplified system management 
the company does not have a significant history of sales of telephony products as it only acquired the distribution rights in in its preferred configuration  this telephone service which is capable of deploying voip service at lower cost is a true primary line service with full capability 
sales volume has been lower than originally anticipated 
while the company believes that sales will grow at a moderate pace  it is unclear whether such sales will become a significant source of revenue for the company 
microwave products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using point to point communication links in the ghz range of frequencies 
products offered in this category are power amplifiers  repeaters  receivers  transmitters and compatible accessories 
these products convert the headend output up to the microwave band and transmit this signal using parabolic antennas 
at each receiver site  a parabolic antenna receiver combination converts the signal back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers at the receiver site 
due to a second order on reconsideration adopted by the federal communications commission fcc in november  coupled with the availability and inherent superiority of fiber optics in linking adjacent properties in mdu applications  sales of microwave products have diminished 
while microwave products will continue to be sold to maintain existing systems  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
fiber products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using fiber optic cable 
among the products offered are optical transmitters  receivers  couplers  splitters  compatible accessories and ftth fiber to the home solutions 
these products convert rf frequencies to light or infrared frequencies and launch them on optical fiber 
at each receiver site  an optical receiver is used to convert the signals back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers 
sales of products in this category are expected to increase due to the company s recent addition of fiber to the home products 
distribution products used to permit signals to travel from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home  apartment unit  hotel room  office or other terminal location along a distribution network of fiber optic or coaxial cable 
among the products offered by the company in this category are line extenders  broadband amplifiers  directional taps  splitters and wall taps 
in cable television systems  the distribution products are either mounted on exterior telephone poles or encased in pedestals  vaults or other security devices 
in private cable systems the distribution system is typically enclosed within the walls of the building if a single structure or added to an existing structure using various techniques to hide the coaxial cable and devices 
the non passive devices within this category are designed to ensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination to provide high quality audio video images 
the company estimates distribution products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in addressable subscriber and interdiction products used to control access to programming at the subscriber s location 
among the products offered by the company in this category are i its videomask addressable signal jammer  licensed from philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate philips broadband networks  inc ii the smi interdiction product line acquired from scientific atlanta  inc as part of its interdiction business  and iii the addressable multi tap amt 
interdiction products limit the availability of programs to subscribers  through jamming of particular channels 
such products enable an operator or consumer to control subscriber access to premium channels and other enhanced services locally or through a computer located off premises 
they also eliminate the necessity of an operator having to make a service call to install or remove passive traps and eliminate the costs associated with damage or loss of analog set top converters in the subscribers locations 
the company believes that the reduction in operating costs  programming piracy  and converter loss which can be obtained through the use of interdiction can be a significant factor in further product penetration into the franchise cable market in mdu applications 
recently  the company introduced a consumer version of this product  the tv channel blocker parental control  which provides local at the consumer level control of the full analog block of channels 
the customer can select which programs he or she considers objectionable to his or her children or family and locally select to block them 
while it is not possible to predict the breadth of market acceptance for these products  the company believes there is reasonable potential in the private cable market  franchise cable market and consumer market as alternatives to  or in conjunction with  set top converters and as a viable option for companies and municipalities that are overbuilding existing cable infrastructures and are seeking a more consumer friendly and cost effective way to compete with the incumbent franchise cable operator 
test products used for measuring signals in the headend and distribution 
among the products offered by the company in this category are analog and digital spectrum analyzers  qpsk analyzers  and hand held palm analyzers 
while the company expects to continue selling test products to meet the needs of customers  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
the company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements 
typically  these modifications are minor and do not materially alter the functionality of the products 
thus  the inability of the customer to accept such products does not generally result in the company being otherwise unable to sell such products to other customers 
research and product development the markets served by blonder tongue are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete effectively in this environment  the company must engage in ongoing research and development in order to i create new products  ii expand the frequency range of existing products in order to accommodate customer demand for greater channel capacity  iii license new technology such as digital satellite receiver decoders and high speed data transmission products  and iv acquire products incorporating technology that could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources  to suit the dynamics of the evolving marketplace 
research and development projects are often initially undertaken at the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the company s customers and customer prospects with the expectation or promise of substantial future orders from such customers or customer prospects 
additional research and development efforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and engineering to lower production costs 
for the acquisition of new technologies  the company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties when the company believes that it can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than the company could otherwise develop on its own  or when the desired technology is proprietary to a third party 
there were employees in the research and development department of the company at december  the company spent   and  on research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
marketing and sales blonder tongue markets and sells its products worldwide to the following markets private cable operators  system contractors  franchise cable operators  the lodging industry  institutions  satellite dealers and retailers 
sales are made directly to customers by the company s internal sales force  as well as through numerous domestic stocking distributors which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal 
these distributors serve multiple markets 
direct sales to private cable operators and system integrators accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal the company s sales and marketing function is predominantly performed by its internal sales force 
should it be deemed necessary  the company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to specific customer prospects 
the company s internal sales force consists of employees  which currently includes salespersons salespersons in old bridge  new jersey  one salesperson in each of north myrtle beach  south carolina  cudahy  wisconsin  austin  tx and santa margarita  ca and sales support personnel at the company headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s standard customer payment terms are  net days 
from time to time where the company determines that circumstances warrant  such as when a customer agrees to commit to a large blanket purchase order  the company extends payment terms beyond its standard payment terms 
the company has several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of its products 
blonder tongue participates in industry trade shows and conferences 
the company also publishes technical articles in trade and technical journals  distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations plan to ensure complete coverage of blonder tongue s products and technology by editors of trade journals 
the company provides system design engineering for its customers  maintains extensive ongoing communications with many original equipment manufacturer customers and provides one on one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential new customers 
blonder tongue supplies sales and applications support  product literature and training to its sales representatives and distributors 
the management of the company travels extensively  identifying customer needs and meeting potential customers 
the company had approximately  in purchase orders as of december  and approximately  in purchase orders as of december  all outstanding purchase orders as of december  are expected to be shipped prior to december  these purchase orders are for the future delivery of products and are subject to cancellation by the customers 
customers blonder tongue has a broad customer base  which in consisted of approximately active accounts 
approximately   and of the company s revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to the company s five largest customers 
in and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately and respectively of the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to these entities  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
however  the company anticipates that these customers will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods  although none of them is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
the complement of leading customers may shift as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
the company believes that many integrators will grow rapidly  and as such the company s success will depend in part on the viability of those customers and on the company s ability to maintain its position in the overall marketplace by shifting its emphasis to those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the company s leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or the company s inability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators which may replace the present leading customers  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental united states  however  the company also derives revenues from customers outside the continental united states  primarily in canada and to a more limited extent  in underdeveloped countries 
television service is less developed in many international markets  particularly latin america and asia  creating opportunity for those participants who offer quality products at a competitive price 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately  and of the company s revenues in fiscal years  and respectively 
all of the company s transactions with customers located outside of the continental united states are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the company has no material foreign currency transactions 
in connection with the company s anticipated expansion into the prc  the company will likely have foreign currency transactions and will be subject to various capital and exchange controls programs related to its prc operations 
see risk factors below for more detail on the risk of foreign operations 
manufacturing and suppliers blonder tongue s manufacturing operations are located at the company s headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the assembly and testing of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts  printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication from raw sheet metal of chassis and cabinets for such assemblies 
management continues to implement a significant number of changes to the manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost  including logistics modifications on the factory floor  an increased use of surface mount  axial lead and radial lead robotics to place electronic components on printed circuit boards  a continuing program of circuit board redesign to make more products compatible with robotic insertion equipment and an increased integration in machining and fabrication 
all of these efforts are consistent with and part of the company s strategy to provide its customers with high performance to cost ratio products 
the company has also formed the joint venture with master gain  which joint venture expects to acquire a manufacturing facility in the prc and ultimately commence production of certain products at that facility 
if successful  the company may shift a material portion of its manufacturing operations to the prc in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiencies 
outside contractors supply standard components  etch printed circuit boards and electronic subassemblies to the company s specifications 
while the company generally purchases electronic parts which do not have a unique source  certain electronic component parts used within the company s products are available from a limited number of suppliers and can be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such component parts 
if the company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part  the company believes that alternative parts could be obtained or system design changes implemented 
however  in such situations the company may experience temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by the component shortage 
on an as needed basis  the company purchases several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as the videocipher and digicipher encryption systems manufactured by motorola  which are standard encryption methodologies employed on us c band and ku band transponders  echostar digital receivers for delivery of dish network programming  and hughes digital satellite receivers for delivery of directv programming 
an inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of these components could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company does not have an agreement with any sole source supplier requiring the supplier to sell a specified volume of components to the company 
blonder tongue maintains a quality assurance program which tests samples of component parts purchased  as well as its finished products  on an ongoing basis and also conducts tests throughout the manufacturing process using commercially available and in house built testing systems that incorporate proprietary procedures 
blonder tongue performs final product tests on of its products prior to shipment to customers 
competition all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than blonder tongue which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to the company sell directly as well as through distributors into the franchise and private cable marketplaces 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the company 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than blonder tongue 
the company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could result in price reductions  loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders 
the principal methods of competition are product differentiation  performance and quality  price and terms  service  and technical and administrative support 
the company believes it differentiates itself from competitors by continuously offering new products and delivering a high performance to cost ratio 
intellectual property the company currently holds united states patents and foreign patents covering a wide range of electronic systems and circuits  of which united states patents and foreign patents were obtained in the company s acquisition of scientific atlanta  inc s interdiction business during other than certain of the patents acquired from scientific atlanta  inc  none of the company s patents are considered material to the company s present operations because they do not relate to high volume applications 
because of the rapidly evolving nature of the cable television industry  the company believes that its market position as a supplier to cable integrators derives primarily from its ability to develop a continuous stream of new products which are designed to meet its customers needs and which have a high performance to cost ratio 
the company has a registered trademark on blonder tongue and also on a bt logo 
in connection with the transactions pursuant to which the company acquired an ownership interest in netlinc and blonder tongue telephone  the company granted blonder tongue telephone a non exclusive  revocable and royalty free license to use these trademarks and certain variations of such names 
the company is a licensee of philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate philips broadband networks  inc  motorola  hughes and several smaller software development companies 
under the philips license agreements  the company is granted a non exclusive license for a term which expires in  concurrently with the last to expire of the relevant patents 
the philips license agreements provide for the payment by the company of a one time license fee and for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
the company is a licensee of motorola relating to motorola s videocipher encryption technology and is also a party to a private label agreement with motorola relating to its digicipher technology 
under the videocipher license agreement  the company is granted a non exclusive license under certain proprietary know how  to design and manufacture certain licensed products to be compatible with the videocipher commercial descrambler module 
the videocipher license agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
the videocipher license agreement also provides for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
under the digicipher private label agreement  the company is granted the non exclusive right to sell digicipher ii integrated receiver decoders bearing the blonder tongue name for use in the commercial market 
the digicipher private label agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
during  the company entered into several software development and license agreements for specifically designed controller and interface software necessary for the operation of the company s video central remote interdiction control system  which is used for remote operation of videomask signal jammers installed at subscriber locations 
these licenses are perpetual and require the payment of a one time license fee and in one case additional payments  the aggregate of which are not material 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and know how 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technologies and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know how independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the company s products and such competition could adversely affect the prices for the company s products or the company s market share 
the company also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining its competitive position 
regulation private cable  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
franchise cable operators had been subject to extensive government regulation pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future rate increases 
the telecommunications act of deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
in june   the fcc adopted and issued a final rule and order relating to the re designation of portions of the ghz frequency band among the various currently allocated services 
the final rules regarding this issue provided for the grandfathering  for a period of ten years  of certain pre existing installed terrestrial fixed service operators tfsos and tfsos that had made application for a license prior to a certain date 
the fcc segmented the ghz frequency band into several sub bands and provided for varying obligations and rights as between the tfsos and fixed satellite service operators fssos 
overall  the final rules were complex and placed a measure of uncertainty upon tfsos considering the use of microwave gear in new systems 
in november  the fcc issued a second order on reconsideration the second order  which redefined the use of the ghz microwave band 
among other things  the second order changed the permissible band of transmission for future microwave links from the to ghz band to the ghz to ghz band 
as a result of the second order  the company s existing microwave inventory would have to be modified to function within the new frequency band 
the new ghz band provides additional channel capacity to the private cable operator 
in addition  on april   the fcc international bureau released a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm  docket  which among other things  proposes channelization changes for the ghz band 
through this nprm  the fcc international bureau is seeking to reduce the useable band from ghz to ghz 
this proposed change  if adopted  would reduce ghz channel capacity for private cable operator use 
the impact on future ghz sales remains uncertain at this time 
these issues  coupled with the expanding use of fiber optic cable and the inherent superiority in fiber due to its greater bandwidth capability  have resulted in a shift in customer purchases away from microwave gear and toward fiber optics 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
the company did not incur in and does not anticipate incurring in material capital expenditures for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on the company 
further  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
any failure by the company to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
the company presently holds a permit from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep  division of environmental quality  air pollution control program relating to its operation of certain process equipment  which permit expires in may  the company has held such a permit for this equipment on a substantially continuous basis since approximately april  the company also has authorization under the new jersey pollution discharge elimination system discharge to surface waters general industrial stormwater permit  permit no 
nj this permit will expire may  employees as of february   the company employed approximately people  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in quality assurance  in sales and marketing  and in a general and administrative capacity

item a risk factors the company s business operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following risk factors highlights some of these risks 
additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company now deems immaterial may also affect the company and the value of its common stock 
the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this report  should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could harm the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
solely for purposes of the risk factors in this item a  the terms we  our and us refer to blonder tongue laboratories  inc and its subsidiaries 
any substantial decrease in sales to one or more of our five largest customers may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to our five largest customers 
in   and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to these customers  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
however  we anticipate that these customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods  although none of them is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products beyond outstanding purchase orders or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
the complement of leading customers may shift as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
we believe that many integrators will grow rapidly  and  as such  our success will depend in part on the viability of those customers  our ability to identify those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects  and our ability to maintain our position in the overall marketplace by shifting our emphasis to such customers 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or our inability to develop solid relationships with the integrators which may replace the present leading customers  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an inability to reduce expenses or increase of revenues may cause continued net losses 
we have had net losses each year since while management believes its plans to reduce expenses and increase revenues will return us to profitability  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
failure to reduce expenses or increase revenues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant increase to inventory reserves due to inadequate reserves in a prior period or to an increase in excess or obsolete inventories may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we continually analyze our slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices  we establish reserves 
if we do not meet our sales expectations  these reserves are increased 
products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value 
we recorded an increase to our reserve of   and  during  and  respectively 
although we believe reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value  there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional inventory reserves in the future 
significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an inability to develop  or acquire the rights to  technology  products or applications in response to changes in industry standards or customer needs may reduce our sales and profitability 
both the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by the continuing advancement of technology  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
to be successful  we must anticipate the evolution of industry standards and changes in customer needs  through the timely development and introduction of new products  enhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties 
although we depend primarily on our own research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products  we have and may continue to seek licenses for new technology from third parties when we believes that we can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than we could otherwise develop on our own  or when the desired technology has already been patented by a third party 
there can  however  be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the cable television or the communications industry generally  we will be able to anticipate changes in the market and customer needs  technologies and applications under development by us will be successfully developed  or successfully developed technologies and applications will achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce products and applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
anticipated increases in direct and indirect competition with us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
all aspects of our business are highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than us  which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to us sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by us 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we have 
we expect that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition through price reductions  loss of market share  delays in the timing of customer orders  and an inability to increase our penetration into the cable television market 
our sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators 
the vast majority of our revenues in fiscal years  and came from sales of our products for use primarily in private cable systems 
demand for our products depends to a large extent upon capital spending on private cable systems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
capital spending by private cable operators and  therefore  our sales and profitability  are dependent on a variety of factors  including access by private cable operators to financing for capital expenditures  demand for their cable services  availability of alternative video delivery technologies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  our sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over build existing cable system infrastructures  or constructing  rebuilding  maintaining and upgrading their systems 
there can be no assurance that system operators in private cable or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining  or upgrading their systems 
any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any significant casualty to our facility in old bridge  new jersey may cause a lengthy interruption to our business operations 
we operate out of one manufacturing facility in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility 
while we maintain a limited amount of business interruption insurance  a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of the ability to manufacture at  or otherwise use  that facility would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on certain third party suppliers could create an inability for us to obtain component products not otherwise available or to do so only at increased prices 
we purchase several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as the videocipher and digicipher encryption systems manufactured by general instrument corporation  which are standard encryption methodology employed on united states c band and ku band transponders  certain components of echostar s digital satellite receiver decoders  which are specifically designed to work with the dish network  and certain components of hughes network systems digital satellite receivers which are specifically designed to work with directv programming 
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components  our receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices  or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the pricing of our products 
our existing and proposed international sales and operations subject us to the risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in foreign telecommunications standards  and unfavorable political  regulatory  labor and tax conditions in other countries 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
such sales are subject to certain risks such as changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  capital and exchange control programs  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
there can be no assurance that sales to customers outside the united states will reach or exceed historical levels in the future  or that international markets will continue to develop or that we will receive additional contracts to supply our products for use in systems and equipment in international markets 
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if international markets do not continue to develop  we do not continue to receive additional contracts to supply our products for use in systems and equipment in international markets or our international sales are affected by the other risks of international operations 
our anticipated international operations in the prc may subject us to the risks of unfavorable political  regulatory  legal  and labor conditions in the prc 
during the second half of  we expect to being manufacturing and assembling some of our products in the peoples republic of china  or prc 
in addition  we may increase the amount of revenues we derive from sales to customers outside the united states  including sales in the prc 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the risks related to  or any other problems arising from  operating in the prc  including those risks described in the preceding risk factor 
although the prc has a large and growing economy  its potential economic  political  legal and labor developments entail uncertainties and risks 
while the prc has been receptive to foreign investment  we cannot be certain that its current policies will continue indefinitely into the future 
in the event of any changes that adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations within the prc after we commence operations  our business will suffer 
shifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense 
we have signed an agreement with master gain with an intention to acquire a manufacturing facility in the prc and ultimately commence production of certain products at this facility 
if successful  over time we may shift a material portion of our operations to the prc in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiency 
this could result in reducing our domestic operations in the future  which in turn could entail significant one time earnings charges to account for severance  equipment write offs or write downs and moving expenses 
competitors may develop products that are similar to  and compete with  our products due to our limited proprietary protection 
other than the smi interdiction product line acquired by us from scientific atlanta  inc  the underlying technology for which is covered by numerous us and international patents  we possess limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to our technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know how 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products which compete with our products 
such competition could adversely affect the prices for our products or our market share and could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
patent infringement claims against us or our customers  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant costs 
while we do not believe that our products including products and technologies licensed from others infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted against us or our customers 
damages for violation of third party proprietary rights could be substantial  in some instances damages are trebled  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims  we would incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us or our customers  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances  a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all 
the failure to obtain a license to a third party s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in governmental regulation of the private cable or franchise cable market may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the private cable industry  which represents the vast majority of our business  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted in the future which impose burdensome restrictions on private cable operators resulting in  among other things  barriers to the entry of new competitors or limitations on capital expenditures by private cable operators 
any such regulations  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
operators in the franchise cable market  which represents a relatively small percentage of our business  had been subject to extensive government regulation pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future rate increases 
the telecommunications act of has deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and has opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted which would re impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in  among other things  the grant of exclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas 
in addition  certain rules adopted by the fcc in june  as further revised in and provide for the re designation of portions of the ghz frequency band among the various currently allocated services  which rules have shifted demand away from our microwave gear 
any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in governmental environmental regulations or our inability or failure to comply with existing environmental regulations may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
we do not anticipate material capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on us 
further  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations 
any failure by us to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
losing the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees  or our inability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced employees  could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key executives and technical and management personnel  including james a 
luksch  chief executive officer  and robert j 
pall  president and chief operating officer 
we maintain and are the beneficiary of  of key man life insurance on each of mr 
luksch and mr 
pall 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  manufacturing  marketing and managerial personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  in particular the principal members of our management and technical staff  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our organizational documents and delaware state law contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover or change in control of our company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  to determine the powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the common stock 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting  does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors  does not provide our stockholders with the right to call special meetings  provides for a classified board of directors  and imposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for our stockholders to affect certain corporate actions 
these provisions and the board s ability to issue preferred stock may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or offers from third parties to acquire our company  preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock  or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company 
we are also afforded the protection of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  impede a merger  consolidation or other business combination involving us  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 
any of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
it is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business and therefore do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
moreover  our loan agreement with national city business credit prohibits the payment of cash dividends by us on our common stock 
potential fluctuations in the stock price for our common stock may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations  failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community s expectations  and market conditions for cable industry stocks in general  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
delays or difficulties in negotiating a labor agreement may cause an adverse effect on our manufacturing and business operations 
all of our direct labor employees are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local  under a collective bargaining agreement  which expires in february delays or difficulties in negotiating and executing a new agreement  which may result in work stoppages  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
item properties the company s principal manufacturing  engineering  sales and administrative facilities consist of one building totaling approximately  square feet located on approximately acres of land in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility which is owned by the company 
the old bridge facility is encumbered by a mortgage held by national city business credit  inc in the principal amount of  as of december  management believes that the old bridge facility is adequate to support the company s anticipated needs in subject to compliance with applicable zoning and building codes  the old bridge real property is large enough to double the size of the plant to accommodate expansion of the company s operations should the need arise

certain distributorship agreements were also concurrently entered into among netlinc  btt and the company pursuant to which the company ultimately acquired the right to distribute netlinc s telephony products to private and franchise cable operators as well as to all buyers for use in mdu applications 
btt partners with clecs to offer primary voice service to mdus  receiving a portion of the line charges due from the clecs telephone customers  and the company offers for sale a line of telephony equipment to complement the voice service 
as a result of netlinc s inability to retain a contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply the products in a timely and consistent manner in accordance with the requisite specifications  in september  the parties agreed to restructure the terms of their business arrangement entered into in march  the restructured business arrangement was accomplished by amending certain of the agreements previously entered into and entering into certain new agreements 
some of the principal terms of the restructured arrangement include increasing the company s economic ownership in netlinc from to and in btt from to  all at no additional cost to the company 
the cash portion of the purchase price in the venture was decreased from  to  and the then outstanding balance of  was paid in installments of  per week until it was paid in full in october  in addition  of the  shares of common stock issued to btt as the non cash component of the purchase price fair valued at  one half  shares have been pledged to the company as collateral to secure btt s obligation to repay the  cash component of the purchase price to the company via preferential distributions of cash flow under btt s limited liability company operating agreement 
under the restructured arrangement  the company can purchase similar telephony products directly from third party suppliers other than netlinc and  in connection therewith  the company would pay certain future royalties to netlinc and btt from the sale of these products by the company 
while the distributorship agreements among netlinc  btt and the company have not been terminated  the company does not anticipate purchasing products from netlinc in the near term 
netlinc  however  continues to own intellectual property  which may be further developed and used in the future to manufacture and sell telephony products under the distributorship agreements 
in addition to receiving incremental revenues associated with its direct sales of telephony products  the company also anticipates receiving additional revenues from telephony services provided by or through contracts for such services obtained by bdr broadband  btt through the company s stake therein as well as through joint ventures with third parties 
it has been the company s experience that the time frame from introduction of a telephony service opportunity to consummation of the associated right of entry agreement  is longer than the time frame relating to obtaining rights of entry for the provision of video and high speed data services 
this protracted time frame has had an adverse impact on the growth of telephony system revenues 
as a result  sales volume has been lower than originally anticipated 
while the company believes that sales will grow at a moderate pace  it is unclear whether such sales will become a significant source of revenue for the company

legal title and risk of loss with respect to the products pass to customers at the point of shipment 
customers do not have a right to return products shipped 
products carry a three year warranty  which amount is not material to the company s operations

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from customers to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectibility of those balances 
management s estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowances and net income 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management assumptions  these allowances may need to be adjusted in the future 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value may be impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
if impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the long lived asset 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each long lived asset are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties
