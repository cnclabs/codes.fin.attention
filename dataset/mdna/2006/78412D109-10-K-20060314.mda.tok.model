item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation business strategy summary the company is primarily a regulated natural gas distribution company with operations in michigan and alaska 
the company provides natural gas service to approximately  customers  with approximately  customers in michigan and  customers in alaska 
approximately of the company s market consists of residential customers 
the company s gas distribution business sells a significant portion of gas to customers for heating purposes and  therefore  is a seasonal business 
as a result  earnings are significantly influenced by the weather and concentrated in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of the year 
the company typically experiences net losses during the non heating season  which takes place in the second and third fiscal quarters of the year 
the company s business is regulated by the mpsc  ccbc  and rca 
the company s current strategic focus remains two fold 
first  the company continues to seek to improve its financial performance by enhancing financial flexibility through cost control and improving credit quality 
in  this effort is expected to include containing its controllable costs including capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses 
the company is also considering i seeking mpsc and rca approval of possible changes in the methods by which the company charges customers for natural gas service which is known in the industry as rate design  and ii depending on analyses of the company s revenue needs  seeking approval of increases in the rates the company s charges customers for natural gas service in jurisdictions where doing so is warranted and otherwise considered achievable 
an analysis of possible rate design proposals is currently under way  including an assessment of the relative merits 
table of contents of various alternative ways of collecting revenues from customers 
a primary focus of this effort is to attempt to devise acceptable revenue collection methods that address the impact of higher and more volatile gas prices on the company 
analyses of the company s need for additional revenue  by jurisdiction  will be performed using year end data  again with a view towards assessing that need if any and other aspects of any base rate increase proposals  including the expected receptivity of regulatory agencies where such requests would be filed  to such proposals and the relationships if any between possible rate increase proposals and the company s rate design proposals  when finalized 
part of the analysis of the company s need for additional revenue is expected to involve an assessment of ratemaking conventions that affect the calculation of revenues the company is authorized to collect and the need for  and acceptability of  changes in such conventions 
upon completion of the analyses of the company s need for additional revenue  with respect to the company s mpsc regulated service area  it is anticipated that the company will have a revenue deficiency in connection with its allowed rate of return  using a test year 
also  under current rate designs in michigan  the company believes it is disadvantaged in achieving its authorized return  given the current higher and more volatile natural gas price environment 
of particular concern are declining consumption per customer  higher bad debt expense  increased lost and unaccounted for lauf gas expense  higher working capital requirements  and conventions used to estimate the impact of weather on the company s revenues 
depending on the results of the analyses of the company s need for additional revenues and rate design alternatives  the company would expect to file for base rate changes and or rate design changes for its mpsc regulated service area during the second quarter of the second aspect of the company s strategic focus is growing its gas distribution business including related pipeline and storage operations by seeking to make appropriate acquisitions and investments in michigan  alaska  and elsewhere 
the company s ability to make such acquisitions and investments will be affected by efforts to improve the company s financial condition described above and elsewhere in this form k as well as by the availability of appropriate acquisition and investment opportunities and the ability to consummate any such transactions on reasonable terms 
it is the company s intent that any such acquisitions and investments  which typically would be subject to federal and state regulatory approvals  would be accretive to earnings 
it is unlikely  however  that such acquisitions and investments  if made  would significantly change the profile of the company s business  since any natural gas distribution  pipeline or storage operations the company would acquire would likely share the characteristic of having earnings that are significantly influenced by the weather 
such acquisitions and investments also would likely involve companies that are subject to regulation with respect to services  rates  and other terms and conditions of service by federal  state  and local regulatory bodies 

table of contents summary of results of operations the discussions in this section are summarized and intended to provide an overview of the results of company operations 
in most instances  the items discussed here are covered in greater detail in later sections of management s discussion and analysis 
any variances in results in this section are quantified on an after tax basis 
the company uses an effective income tax rate of to estimate these after tax amounts 
all references to earnings or losses per share eps in management s discussion and analysis are on a fully diluted basis

the company s million of net income available to common shareholders for is an million improvement over results 
there were a number of offsetting factors that impacted net income available to common shareholders 
the primary factors that improved results  when compared to  were an increase in gas sales margin and other gas distribution revenue  the absence from results of expenses associated with the terminated sale of the company s apc subsidiary  changes in results from discontinued operations million of income in compared to million of losses in  and a decrease in property and other taxes 
the increase in gas sales margin and other gas distribution revenue increased net income by approximately million and was attributed in large part to rate increases in michigan and the addition of new customers  partially offset by a decrease in gas consumption by customers 
the expenses included in results for the company s apc subsidiary include costs associated with an arbitration proceeding over the termination of the company s sale of the apc subsidiary and a payment by the company to settle the matter 
these apc related expenses increased the net loss by approximately million 
the decrease in property and other tax expense increased net income by approximately million 

table of contents the primary factors that negatively impacted earnings for  when compared to  were a premium associated with the repurchase of the cps  a non cash debt extinguishment charge  increases in operations and maintenance expenses  increased depreciation expense  and the absence from results of state income tax benefits recorded in the premium associated with the repurchase of the cps decreased net income by approximately million 
the non cash debt extinguishment charge  which represents the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with long term debt retired in  decreased net income by approximately million 
the increase in operations and maintenance expenses  which decreased net income by approximately million  was due primarily to increases in employee benefit and incentive costs  compensation  facilities costs  uncollectible customer accounts and various other operating expenses  due to the increasing cost of doing business 
the increase in depreciation expense reduced net income by approximately million 
the state income tax benefits recorded in amounted to approximately million and related to a change in estimate of the company s prior years state income taxes 
combined financing costs for  which include interest expense and dividends on both the cps and newly issued preferred stock  were essentially unchanged from comparison of and results 
the million net loss available to common shareholders for is a million improvement over results 
there were a number of offsetting factors that impacted the net loss available to common shareholders 
the primary factors that improved earnings for  when compared to  were a million decrease in losses from the company s discontinued construction services business  the non recurrence in of million of debt exchange and extinguishment costs recorded in  and a change in estimate of the company s prior years state income taxes  which resulted in an additional income tax benefit of approximately million in the primary factors that negatively impacted earnings for  when compared to  were a decrease in gas sales margin  the previously discussed apc related expenses incurred in  and increases in operations and maintenance expenses and financing costs 
the decrease in gas sales margin  which increased the net loss for by approximately million  was largely caused by a decrease in gas consumption by customers and an increase in lauf gas expense partially offset by gas sales margins from new customers 
the increase in operations and maintenance expenses increased the net loss by approximately million and the increase in financing costs increased the net loss by approximately million 
the business segment analysis and other discussions on the next several pages provide additional information regarding the differences in operating results when comparing  and the impact of higher natural gas prices the market price of natural gas increased substantially during the second half of the company believes that such price increases were caused  in large part  by the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on drilling  production  pipelines and processing facilities in and around the gulf of mexico  along with the supporting infrastructure and resources for those facilities 
the company also believes that higher natural gas prices may persist or remain volatile even after hurricane related damage to production and other facilities is repaired  due to an apparent imbalance between natural gas supplies and demand resulting from  among other factors  the use of substantial amounts of natural gas to generate electricity and environmental and other restrictions on natural gas exploration and production 
for customers in its michigan service areas  the company purchases natural gas supplies throughout the year  in order to i meet current customer needs  ii inject gas into storage for use by customers during the winter heating season  and iii have sufficient supplies under contract for the winter heating season 
recent natural gas purchases for customers in the company s michigan gas service areas have  and future purchases are expected to  cost significantly more than purchases during prior years due to the increase in natural gas prices 
since mid december  natural gas prices have receded from their peak levels established earlier in december the recent decline in prices may be attributable  among other factors  to reduced customer gas consumption in reaction to high prices  relatively warm weather in january throughout the midwestern and eastern portions of the united states and relatively high levels of working gas in storage in comparison to average levels over the last five years 
despite the recent pullback in natural gas prices  future 
table of contents prices still remain relatively high for the upcoming winter heating season 
additionally  since the majority of the company s michigan gas procurement for the winter heating season occurred throughout  the recent reduction in natural gas prices is not expected to impact the gas commodity portion of customer rates substantially until after the winter heating season has passed 
approximately to of annual michigan sales volumes typically occur in the first quarter of each year  so nearly half of the company s gas sales in michigan will have occurred before there would be any significant decrease in the gas commodity portion of customer rates 
for customers in alaska  the company s facilities are located near natural gas supplies  and the company has rca approved gas purchase contracts with various cook inlet area producers 
the price of gas purchased under these contracts is adjusted annually in january 
much of the natural gas purchased by the company for its alaska customers is priced on trailing average prices for oil and natural gas  so recent price increases are not yet fully reflected in the price the company is currently paying for gas sold to customers in its alaska service area 
however  gas prices under these contracts have increased over the past few years and  based on these trailing average prices  are expected to increase in the future 
in general  the costs of natural gas purchased for customers are recovered on a dollar for dollar basis in the absence of regulatory disallowances  without a profit 
the recovery of these gas costs is accomplished through the company s gcr pricing mechanisms  through which customer rates are periodically adjusted for increases and decreases in the cost of gas purchased by the company for sale to customers 
refer to the caption cost of gas  gas charges recoverable from customers  and amounts payable to customers in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on the gcr pricing mechanisms 
when gas costs increase substantially such as has been the case recently  the company may require regulatory approval in certain of its regulatory jurisdictions to increase the commodity  or gcr  component of rates  to ensure the timely recovery of the cost of gas purchased for sale to customers 
in addition  higher gas costs may increase delinquent or uncollectible accounts  increase the value of lauf gas and decrease customer consumption 
these and other factors could result in an increase in working capital requirements and the need for the company to borrow additional amounts under its bank credit agreement 
the company has been addressing  and continues to address  the likely impact of higher natural gas prices by i seeking gcr rate increases in michigan to recover the cost of gas on a timely basis  ii closely monitoring customer payment patterns in michigan and alaska  encouraging the use of budget type levelized payment plans and referring customers to sources of charitable and public assistance  iii attempting to secure mpsc approval to recover the commodity costs associated with lauf gas and uncollectibles in the gcr component of rates or in another way that would reflect actual costs incurred by the company  and iv monitoring the impact of higher gas costs on customer consumption and the company s working capital 
in addition  the company is assessing the need for changes in rate design  changes in ratemaking conventions  and increases in revenues to be collected from customers  with a view towards addressing  among other things  the impact of higher and more volatile natural gas prices 
the mpsc approved gcr rate affects approximately  customers in the company s service territory regulated by the mpsc 
in october  the mpsc approved a settlement under which the company increased its gcr rate to recover the increases in the cost of natural gas purchased by the company for sale to customers 
the gcr rate for the approximately  customers in the service territory regulated by the ccbc is revised monthly  to track and recover changes in the cost of natural gas purchased by the company for use by battle creek area customers 
the gcr rate for the approximately  customers in alaska is established annually in january by the rca to reflect the pricing mechanisms in certain long term gas supply contracts approved by the rca and  recovers the cost of natural gas purchased by the company under those contracts 
higher gas costs  to the extent they are reflected in revised rates  may affect the ability of some customers to pay their bills for gas service on time or in full 
the company plans to monitor customer payment patterns closely and has been and is encouraging customers to elect budget type levelized payment plans  to spread winter heating season bills over a twelve month period 
in addition to cutting off service to delinquent 
table of contents customers  as necessary and permitted  the company will refer customers to sources of charitable and public assistance 
the company participates in efforts to secure charitable donations that will provide such assistance 
the company s uncollectibles expense for gas sales customers as a percent of gas sales revenue was in  in and for assuming that future uncollectibles expense as a percent of gas sales revenue is similar to the experience in  for each increase in gas sales revenue principally driven by the change in natural gas prices  there would be an expected increase in uncollectibles of approximately million 
the company cannot provide any assurance that its future uncollectibles expense will be consistent with its prior experience  in view of the increased cost of natural gas and related rate increases and other factors affecting customer payment patterns 
the company also expects that higher gas costs will increase the expense associated with lauf gas in its michigan service areas  assuming that lauf volumes are consistent with lauf volumes in prior periods 
annual lauf volumes in michigan have ranged from to of volumes sold and transported in the company s michigan service area over the last years 
the company s michigan gas distribution operation typically accounts for to of total volumes sold and transported by the company 
the company also believes that higher gas costs  to the extent they are reflected in rates  have affected  and may continue to affect  gas consumption by customers  who are induced by higher prices to conserve 
the company is unable to estimate the amount of conservation if any that is likely to occur 
however  the company estimates that every one percent decrease in customer consumption in michigan may cause a decrease in gas sales margin of million to million for the first quarter of the company estimates that every one percent decrease in customer consumption in alaska may cause a decrease in gas sales margin of million to million for the first quarter of the company expects that higher gas costs will increase its need for working capital to finance gas purchases at higher market prices  finance storage inventory  carry accounts receivables  and carry any under recovery of gas costs not recouped in current rates 
the company uses its bank credit agreement to fund its working capital requirements  which normally peak around year end or in early january due to the seasonal nature of the company s business 
the company expects that its bank credit agreement will provide sufficient borrowing capacity to fund working capital requirements through the winter heating season 
the impact of weather and energy conservation temperature fluctuations and energy conservation have a significant impact on operating results of the company 
accordingly  the company believes that information about normal temperatures and consumption is useful for understanding its business and operating results 
consumption of natural gas for heating is largely determined by weather  and a portion of the company s revenues are collected through consumption based charges 
the company s budgets  forecasts and business plans are prepared using expected gas consumption under normal weather conditions and historical consumption patterns 
the regulatory bodies that have jurisdiction over the rates charged by the gas distribution business use weather normalized consumption data to set customer rates and to establish authorized rates of return 
many of the company s customers appear to be continuing a pattern of conserving energy by utilizing energy efficient heating systems  insulation  alternative energy sources  and other energy saving devices and techniques 
during the past several years  average annual gas consumption has been decreasing 
in addition  increases in natural gas prices appear to have increased conservation efforts by customers 
the company expects this conservation trend to continue as an era of higher and more volatile natural gas prices influences customer consumption

degree days for a particular year are determined by adding the degree days incurred during each day of the year 
b normal degree days for a particular year is the average of degree days during the prior fifteen years 
beginning in  the company plans to determine normal degree days for its alaska operations using a ten year average of degree days rather than a fifteen year average 
c the percent by which actual degree days differ from normal degree days is often referred to as the percent by which temperatures were colder warmer than normal 
d the percent by which actual degree days differ from prior year actual degree days is often referred to as the percent by which temperatures were colder warmer than the prior year 
e normalized average annual gas consumption is determined by dividing the actual average annual gas consumption by actual degree days as a percent of normal degree days 
the normalized average annual gas consumption represents an estimate of what average annual gas consumption would have been if during the period in question  actual degree days had equaled normal degree days 
f the percent by which normalized average annual gas consumption differs from prior year normalized average annual gas consumption represents an estimate of the percentage change in gas consumption from one year to the next caused by factors other than temperature variations 
this change can relate to various factors but is most likely due to changes in energy conservation by customers 

table of contents the company has estimated that in its michigan service area  temperatures were approximately and warmer than normal during and  respectively  and approximately colder than normal during in the company s alaska service area  temperatures were estimated to be approximately  and warmer than normal during  and  respectively 
normalized average annual gas consumption for all gas sales customers in the company s michigan and alaska service areas decreased in by a larger percentage than in previous years 
the company has estimated that in its michigan service area  normalized average annual gas consumption during for all gas sales customers decreased by approximately  when compared to in the company s alaska service area  normalized average annual gas consumption during for all gas sales customers decreased by an estimated  when compared to the company estimates that the combined variations from normal temperatures and normalized gas consumption decreased net income by approximately million in and approximately million during these estimates reflect the adoption of new methodologies that are designed to more accurately estimate the impact of combined variations from normal temperatures and normalized gas consumption 
the company estimates the impact on its operating results of combined variations from normal temperatures and normalized gas consumption by comparing average annual gas consumption per customer during a year to the normalized average annual gas consumption per customer for the prior year 
the difference is multiplied by the average number of customers during the year to arrive at the total estimated increase or decrease in consumption associated with the combined variations from normal temperatures and normalized gas consumption 
the total increase or decrease in consumption is multiplied by the actual gas sales margin per unit of gas consumption during the year to arrive at the estimated impact on operating results of combined variations from normal temperatures and normalized gas consumption 
reportable business segments the company is required to disclose information regarding its reportable business segments 
business segments that do not exceed the quantitative thresholds required to be reportable business segments are combined and included with the company s corporate division in a category the company refers to as corporate and other

gas distribution business segment gas sales revenue 
the company s gas sales revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the most significant factor causing the change in gas sales revenue from year to year is the change in the cost of gas sold 
a significant portion of the company s cost of gas sold is accounted for by the company s gcr pricing mechanisms  which allow for the adjustment of rates charged to customers to reflect increases and decreases in the cost of gas purchased by the company 
under these mechanisms  customers are charged rates that allow the company to recoup its cost of gas purchased for sale to customers  subject  in the company s michigan service territory regulated by the mpsc  to a review by the mpsc of the company s gcr gas purchase plan and the reasonableness of actual purchases and procurement practices 
in alaska  gas supply contracts are reviewed by the rca at the time the company enters into those contracts 
as a result of the use of these mechanisms  in the absence of regulatory disallowances  for any increase or decrease in cost of gas sold  there is a corresponding increase or decrease in gas sales revenue 
refer to the caption cost of gas  gas charges recoverable from customers  
table of contents and amounts payable to customers in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information on cost of gas and the gcr mechanisms 
management generally evaluates changes in gas sales margin rather than gas sales revenue  due to the fluctuations caused by market driven changes in cost of gas sold

gas sales margin 
the company s gas sales margin is derived primarily from customer service fees and consumption based distribution fees 
the customer service fees are fixed amounts charged to customers each month 
distribution fees vary each month because they are based on the volume of gas consumed by customers 
there are four primary factors that have historically impacted gas sales margin and may impact future gas sales margin 
these factors are changes in i customer gas consumption  ii the number of gas sales customers  iii lauf gas  and iv customer rates  including gas cost savings 
in addition to these recurring factors  the company sold excess gas to a third party gas supplier in  which also increased gas sales margin for by approximately million 
changes in customer gas consumption from one year to another have historically been attributable primarily to the impact of changes in temperatures between periods 
however  in recent years  other factors including conservation by customers  the increasing use of more energy efficient gas furnaces and appliances  the addition of new energy efficient homes to the company s gas distribution system and the price of natural gas have contributed more significantly than in the past to changes in customer gas consumption 
a decrease in customer gas consumption reduced gas sales margin for by approximately million  when 
table of contents compared to during  customer gas consumption was lower than expected  given that temperatures during were similar to temperatures during the company believes the decrease in gas consumption was due in large part to conservation prompted by the increased cost of natural gas 
refer to the discussion in management s discussion and analysis under the caption the impact of higher natural gas prices 
a decrease in customer gas consumption reduced gas sales margin for by approximately million  when compared to the average number of gas sales customers in michigan and alaska combined excluding customers acquired in the acquisition of peninsular gas has increased by an average of annually during the past three years 
during  company s average number of gas sales customers in michigan and alaska combined excluding peninsular gas customers increased by  or when compared to during  the company s average number of gas sales customers increased by  or when compared to customer additions increased gas sales margin for by approximately million  when compared to customer additions increased gas sales margin for by approximately million  when compared to customers added to the company s michigan operation as a result of the acquisition of peninsular gas contributed million to gas sales margin for lauf gas is a term used in the natural gas distribution industry to refer to the difference between the gas that is measured and injected into the company s gas distribution system and the amount of gas measured at customer meters 
typically  there is more gas injected into a gas utility s distribution system than is actually measured as sold or transported at customer meters 
there are a number of reasons for this lauf gas  including measurement errors and leaks 
the annual lauf gas volumes in michigan have ranged from to of total gas volumes sold and transported in michigan over the last ten years 
an increase in lauf gas expense decreased gas sales margin for by approximately million  when compared to an increase in lauf gas expense decreased gas sales margin for by approximately million  when compared to the cost of lauf gas is affected by the underlying commodity cost and rate mechanisms employed to price lauf gas volumes and recover this cost from customers 
refer to the discussion in management s discussion and analysis under the caption the impact of higher natural gas prices  for more information 
the remainder of the change in gas sales margin from to  an increase of million  was due primarily to changes in rates and gas cost savings  as well as other miscellaneous factors 
these same items also contributed to the remainder of the change in gas sales margin from to  a decrease of million 
there was an increase in customer rates effective in march  for mpsc regulated customers 
the rate increase for mpsc regulated customers was the result of a settlement agreement reached with the mpsc 
the ccbc approved new rates for ccbc regulated customers  effective in april  and the use of a gcr pricing mechanism  effective in april during  and the first three months of  the company s service area regulated by the ccbc was not operating under a gcr pricing mechanism and certain gas cost savings allowed under the terms of a gas supply and management agreement which expired march  were retained by the company 
the gas cost savings realized under the agreement varied from year to year

gas transportation revenue 
the company provides gas transportation services to customers who typically consume large volumes of natural gas 
these customers purchase their natural gas directly from third party suppliers 
the natural gas purchased by customers from third party suppliers is then transported on the company s gas distribution system to the customers 
there was a million increase in gas transportation revenue in  when compared to the increase was primarily due to higher rates and volumes to industrial customers and an increase in transportation volumes to commercial customers  partially offset by a decrease in transportation volumes to power plants 
there was a million increase in gas transportation revenue in  when compared to the primary reasons for the increase were increases 
table of contents in transportation volumes and rates for commercial transport customers  as well as an increase in transportation volumes for industrial and power plant transport customers 
one of the company s alaska service area industrial transportation customers  a fertilizer manufacturer  has publicly announced that it has experienced difficulty in securing sufficient natural gas supplies at an appropriate price to continue operating in the future 
the customer has indicated that it has secured sufficient natural gas supplies to operate at a reduced rate through october  but currently does not have sufficient natural gas under contract at an appropriate price to operate after that date 
transportation revenues to this customer totaled million in and million in based upon volumes transported during and estimates provided by the customer  transportation revenues to this facility are expected to total million in the company cannot predict the likely pattern of future operations at this plant  including whether the plant will ultimately close 
other operating revenue 
increases in miscellaneous customer revenues and pipeline management revenues are the primary reasons for changes in other operating revenue during the past three years 
in addition  a scheduled fee increase and a one time settlement related to one of the company s large pipeline capacity contracts also contributed to the increase in other operating revenue in the miscellaneous customer revenues include various service fees and late payment fees charged to customers 
an increase in these fees from to increased other operating revenue for by approximately million 
an increase in miscellaneous customer fees from to increased other operating revenue for by approximately million 
the pipeline management revenue is earned by norstar 
these revenues increased approximately million in  when compared to  because of revenues earned from norstar s management of a pipeline construction project performed during pipeline management revenue for decreased approximately million from because norstar was only performing routine pipeline management work and did not have a large management project similar to a project norstar managed in operations and maintenance expenses 
for the year  operations and maintenance o m expenses increased by million when compared to during  o m expenses increased by million when compared to the changes in operating expenses over the past three years resulted from four primary factors i employee benefit costs  ii professional fees  iii commercial insurance and claims costs  and iv uncollectible customer accounts 
employee benefit costs primarily include pension expense  medical coverage expense including retiree medical coverage  and incentive compensation 
for  employee benefit costs increased by approximately million 
approximately of this increase was due to increased pension expense while much of the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in incentive compensation 
for  employee benefit costs decreased by approximately million 
the decrease for was a result of a million decrease in medical coverage costs partially offset by increases in other employee benefits 
the decrease in medical coverage costs in was primarily due to plan modifications that required employees and retirees to pay for a larger portion of their medical coverage costs and a decrease in retiree medical expense due to the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare act 
for more information on the medicare act  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
professional fees consisting primarily of accounting and legal fees for were essentially unchanged from levels  but professional fees for increased by approximately million  when compared to the increase in the amount of professional fees in and continued level in were due in large part to the increased level of costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of commercial insurance and claims costs decreased by approximately million for  when compared to for  commercial insurance and claims costs increased by approximately million  when compared to commercial insurance costs have increased significantly over the past few years as a result of the september  attack on the us  which has caused increases in liability insurance costs  and recent corporate financial wrongdoing by other large companies  which has increased director and officer 
table of contents liability insurance costs 
the company had previously been shielded from these increases due to a three year fixed premium general liability policy  which expired in  and a fixed premium excess liability policy  which expired in uncollectible customer accounts increased by approximately million in  when compared to by comparison  during  uncollectible customer accounts decreased by approximately million  when compared to the increase in was due in large part to a higher cost of gas in  offset partially by increased collection efforts and collection programs initiated by the company 
the decrease in uncollectible customer accounts in was primarily due to a reduction in large customer bankruptcy write offs 
the remaining increase in o m expenses from to  and from to  was caused by increases in compensation expense  facilities expense including building and office lease expense  customer collection expense and various other expenses due primarily to inflationary pressures on expenses and the increased cost of doing business 
when expenses continue to increase as a result of inflation or other factors  the company typically files base rate cases to recover the increased cost of doing business 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information regarding recent rate case filings 
depreciation and amortization 
the addition of new customers to the company s gas distribution system typically requires expansion of the system 
in addition  the company has a replacement program to ensure that older sections of its distribution system are being upgraded and replaced  and the company also typically upgrades and relocates parts of its system in connection with public works projects to improve roads and other public facilities 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from year to year is due to depreciation on net additional property  plant and equipment placed in service as a result of expanding and upgrading the system 
property and other taxes 
the company s property and other taxes have increased over the past three years 
the increases are primarily attributed to property taxes 
each year the company s property taxes generally increase as a result of taxes on net additional property  plant and equipment placed in service as part of the expansion and upgrading of the company s gas distribution system 
during  the company also incurred million in additional property tax expense as a result of adjusting the amount it estimated it would recover from certain prior years property tax appeals 
during  the company initiated settlement offers to all taxing jurisdictions involved with the property tax appeals 
numerous taxing jurisdictions have accepted the company s settlement offer and  as a result  the company reduced its property tax expense by approximately million 
the company intends to pursue further refunds in  which is expected to reduce property tax expense

critical accounting policies the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies under which judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
rate regulation 
the gas distribution business is subject to regulation 
the regulatory matters associated with gas distribution customers located in the city of battle creek  michigan  and surrounding communities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ccbc 
the mpsc has jurisdiction over the regulatory matters related to the company s remaining michigan customers 
regulatory matters for gas distribution customers in alaska and apc are subject to the jurisdiction of the rca 
these regulatory bodies have jurisdiction over  among other things  rates  accounting procedures  and standards of service 
the gas distribution business has accounting policies  which conform to sfas  accounting for the effect of certain types of regulation and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the mpsc  ccbc and rca 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the consolidated statements of operations by an unregulated business 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then included in the consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the consolidated statements of financial position and included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as extraordinary items 
goodwill 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the company perform impairment tests on its goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of the company s business segments 
the company s determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows attributable to the company s reporting units that have goodwill  as compared to the carrying value of those reporting units net assets 
the company must make long term 
table of contents forecasts of future revenues  expenses and capital expenditures related to the reporting unit in order to make the estimate of discounted cash flows 
these forecasts require assumptions about future demand  future market conditions  regulatory developments and other factors 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
if an impairment test of goodwill shows that the carrying amount of the goodwill is in excess of the fair value  a corresponding impairment loss would be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment tests were performed for the company s business segments and indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill for any of its business segments 
the annual impairment tests were performed for the company s business segments and indicated that there was an impairment of goodwill at the company s it services business 
the annual impairment tests were performed for the company s business segments and indicated that there was an impairment of goodwill for the construction services business 
for further information on these impairments  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the company accounts for pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with the sfas  employers accounting for pensions and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these statements require liabilities to be recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position at the present value of these future obligations to employees net of any plan assets 
the calculation of these liabilities and associated expenses require the expertise of actuaries and are subject to many assumptions  including life expectancies  present value discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs 
the discount rate used by the company is determined by reference to the citigroup pension discount curve  other long term corporate bond measures and the expected cash flows of the plans 
the duration of the securities underlying those indexes reasonably matches the expected timing of anticipated future benefit payments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is established based on the company s expectations of asset returns for the investment mix in its plans with some reliance on historical asset returns for the plans 
the expected returns of various asset categories are blended to derive an appropriate long term assumption 
any change in these assumptions can significantly change the liability and associated expenses recognized in any given year 
for example  a one percentage point increase in anticipated health care costs each year would increase the accumulated retiree medical obligation as of december   by million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic retiree medical costs for  by million
