item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the national security group  inc referred to in this document as we  our  us  the company or nsec and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
please refer to our note regarding forward looking statements on page of this report 
similar to last year  except for the increase in number  the term hurricane will be prominent throughout management s discussion 
during the third quarter of three hurricanes affected the company s property and casualty coverage areas hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita 
losses resulting from the impact of these third quarter hurricanes significantly influenced the financial results for the year ended december  while total losses  just as with hurricane ivan  were mitigated through risk management using catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance  the company s share of total losses and catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium reduced net income by over  results of operations the following analysis of the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  which begin on page of this form k 
primary reference is made to the consolidated statements of income on page and segment information provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the fourth consecutive year  premium revenue reached a new company record high despite reductions for reinstatement premiums related to hurricane katrina 
total premium revenue was  an increase of just over over premium revenue of  premium revenue in included reductions for catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium triggered by hurricane katrina of  and premium revenue in included reductions for catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium triggered by hurricane ivan of  life segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium revenue while property and casualty segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium  virtually no change from the same period last year 
consolidated income before income taxes declined in to  compared to  in third quarter hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita were the primary factors contributing to the decline in income before taxes in compared to the same period last year 
gross incurred losses  before reinsurance recoveries  from the third quarter hurricanes totaled after reinsurance recoveries  pre tax losses and expenses from third quarter hurricanes totaled over  and a catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium of  was also incurred in the third and fourth quarters of third quarter losses from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita were the primary reason for the decline in net income 
losses and related expenses from hurricanes reduced net income by approximately  or per share 
consolidated net income for was  compared to  in  a decline of 
on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the third consecutive year  premium revenue reached a new company record high 
total premium revenue was  an increase of over premium revenue of  life segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium revenue and increased over property and casualty segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium revenue and increased over continued strong growth in the dwelling property lines of business  particularly the homeowners line of business  were the major contributor to increases in property and casualty premium revenue 
consolidated income before income taxes declined in to  compared to  in hurricane ivan  which struck the alabama gulf coast in september of  is the primary factor leading to the decline in consolidated income before income taxes 
gross incurred losses  before reinsurance recoveries  from hurricane ivan totaled  including paid losses of  case unpaid losses and adjustment expenses of  and incurred but not reported reserve ibnr estimates of  after reinsurance recoveries  pre tax losses from hurricane ivan totaled over  and a catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium of  was also incurred in the third quarter of as for the bottom line impact from hurricane ivan  consolidated net income declined by over  due to losses and expenses related to hurricane ivan 
as a result of hurricane ivan earnings per share  for  declined by 
consolidated net income for was  compared to  in  a decline of 
again  hurricane ivan was the primary factor contributing to the decline in consolidated net income 
on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in additional details on the sources of premium revenue growth and the impact of individual segments on consolidated income will be discussed in the respective segment results of operations sections that follow 
industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life segment  property and casualty segment  and other non insurance is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance income before taxes and minority interest life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance other interest expense in addition to the preceding table  reference is made to note of the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for the segment information that follows 
life and accident and health insurance operations the company s life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  nsic had a loss before income taxes in of  compared to income before tax of  in expenses related to ongoing litigation totaled over  and  in and the litigation expenses are primarily related to an ongoing class action lawsuit which is further discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and form k filed december  and incorporated herein by reference 
based on currently available information  we remain optimistic that this ongoing multi year litigation will reach final settlement during this litigation is periodically reevaluated and estimates are adjusted to reflect total estimated cost 
while we believe that  based on currently available information  our reserves are adequate to cover the total ultimate cost of this settlement  until a final settlement is approved  it is possible that our litigation reserve may have to be adjusted 
premium revenue increased to  in compared to  in  an increase of 
as we have discussed over the last few years  we have began a shift to the independent agent method of distribution of nsic s products 
in  for the first time in company history  we had more business in force that was produced by independent agents than was in force and produced by our traditional home service method of distribution 
independent agent premium revenue grew by year over year in while home service premium revenue declined by 
unfortunately  the shift to the independent agent method of distribution is expensive as commissions paid to independent agents are front loaded  meaning that higher commission rates are paid early in the life of the policy and decline as the policy ages 
this front loading significantly increases our cost of producing new business and until a more substantial book of renewal business is built  this method of distribution will hamper short term earnings 
as discussed last year  nsic has had a primary focus on the production of new business in the independent agent method of distribution over the last five years 
in the process of establishing this position  nsic has had very low thresholds for business production and persistency 
nsic has appointments with approximately that activilely produce new business 
during we did begin the process of implementing new performance standards that will require minimum amounts of premium production and persistency in order to retain a contract with our company 
as a result of these standards  we will become more selective in the appointment of new agents and will discontinue appointments with many current agents 
in undertaking this exercise  we plan to get to a point that we can offer more exceptional service to fewer agents and produce higher quality business in the process 
this process will take a couple of years to implement but will help improve profitability of nsic in the future 
commission expense  including field servicing cost from the home service method of distribution  as a percent of premium revenue increased percentage points in compared to this increase was primarily due to increased separation cost associated in reducing home service management personnel 
independent agent commission expense and other cost of distribution decline percentage points in compared to these costs are expected to continue to decline to percentage points per year for the next couple of years until the renewal book of business reaches a point of maturity to support short term profitability 
life insurance commission rates for independent agents are typically front loaded meaning that higher commissions are paid in the early years of a policy and commission rates decline as the policy ages 
because the independent agent method of distribution is a relatively new method of distribution  overall commission rates are skewed higher because the majority of in force policies are still paying the higher commission rates of the early years 
management is continuing to focus on reducing commissions through improving the rate of retention of new and existing business 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  income before income taxes in was  compared to  in a decline in realized capital gains of  in the life segment was the primary factor contributing to the decline in income before income taxes 
also  litigation related expenses continued to be a drain on the bottom line 
litigation expenses exceeded  in compared to  in litigation expenses for and are related to items discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenue increased to  in compared to  in  an increase of 
premium revenue produced by independent agents totaled  in compared to  in  a increase 
while nsic is continuing to focus on growth through the independent agent method of distribution  we will begin to shift focus to an increased focus on quality 
premium revenue produced by nsic home service agency force increased slightly in to  from  in due to changing market conditions  the home service market is not considered to be a growth market  but the company intends to maintain a niche in this market to serve our current policyholders that prefer this method of service 
at december  nsic had home service agents that serviced this book of business 
commission expense  including field servicing cost from the home service method of distribution  as a percent of premium revenue declined percentage points in compared to commission expense totaled of revenue in compared to over in property casualty operations the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty premium revenues totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of just over 
the property and casualty subsidiaries have generated significant growth in revenue over the last four years 
while growth has slowed  premium revenue was reduced due to additional ceded reinsurance premium paid under the reinstatement provisions of our catastrophe reinsurance contracts triggered by hurricane katrina 
premium revenue for was reduced by due to similar provisions triggered by hurricane ivan 
while overall premium revenue growth moderated significantly in compared to  the property and casualty subsidiaries continued to grow the primary dwelling property lines of dwelling fire  homeowners and mobile homeowners with growth rates of  and respectively 
offsetting these gains were declines in non standard private passenger automobile and ocean marine lines of business 
we expect the trend of more moderate premium revenue growth to continue in with premium revenue growth expected to be in the range of 
as the discussed on the consolidated results of operations section of this report  the hurricane season was the overriding event that led to a decline in earnings for the year and of course property and casualty operations was the operating segment that bore the full brunt of the hurricane season 
income before income tax in the segment declined to  in compared to  in  a decrease of 
claims frequency increased significantly in compared to with claims on dwelling lines of business homeowners and dwelling fire exceeding  claims compared to  claims in approximately  claims were reported from hurricane katrina in  very close to the  claims were reported from hurricane ivan in however  the average severity of claims from hurricane katrina was much higher with losses averaging over  each compared to less than  per occurrence from hurricane ivan 
the increase in the average loss per claim is due to the widespread impact of this huge storm causing severe damage in coastal areas of alabama  louisiana and the most heavily impacted coastal area  mississippi 
the most heavily impacted coastal area for us from hurricane ivan was concentrated in baldwin county  alabama 
additionally  we paid nearly million in underwriting association assessments due to losses from hurricane katrina 
in addition to katrina  we incurred over  claims from hurricane rita with an average severity of  and hurricane dennis with over claims and an average severity of  non hurricane related dwelling property claims totaled  in which remained consistent with non hurricane related claims of just over  average severity for all dwelling property claims was  per occurrence in compared to  in as discussed earlier  average severity was skewed downward due to lower average claims from hurricane ivan 
hurricanes typically cause higher number of claims frequency and a lower average cost per claim severity than tornado related losses 
tornadoes tend to affect a more isolated area and therefore have a lower frequency but typically cause more structural damage including a higher proportion of total losses therefore severity is greater from tornado losses 
non catastrophe related dwelling losses typically have an average per loss severity in the  to  range for the p c subsidiaries 
to help add a little perspective to the magnitude of the hurricane season  we thought it may be useful to give a few statistics 
total insured losses from hurricane katrina alone totaled more than the cumulative amount of hurricane losses paid in previous company history dating back to hurricane katrina was the most expensive hurricane in company history  exceeding the previous most costly storm  hurricane ivan  by over 
hurricane rita  which was a bit of an afterthought in the media  was the fourth most costly hurricane in company history with losses of  our property and casualty subsidiaries had previously never incurred two major hurricanes in a major season until hurricanes katrina and rita in we had also never incurred consecutive hurricane seasons with a major hurricane until and with ivan  katrina and rita while we would like to think that the events of the last two years are statistical anomalies  we are taking a critical look at our hurricane risk mitigation program with a goal of better managing this risk should we actually be entering an era of more frequent and severe atlantic and gulf coast hurricanes 
this is especially challenging for us as a regional carrier with a large percentage of total business concentrated primarily in the southeastern united states 
because of our geographic concentration of risk  we will be unable to totally eliminate the impact of future storms  but we do believe that the events of the last two years will allow some changes in the markets we serve to help mitigate the impact of future storms on short term profits 
we are in the process of making several changes to help reduce future storm exposure 
we will be reviewing rates and minimum deductibles on over of our programs during obviously the risk reward paradigm for writing in coastal areas of the southeastern us has shifted in the last two years 
while we do not want to abandon areas that we have served successfully for many years  we are going to have to seek higher margins on our insurance products in certain coastal areas to justify the economic feasibility of continuing to write in these areas 
we are increasing marketing efforts in the non coastal states that we serve in order to gain greater geographic diversity 
of course this opens us up to more significant exposure to other types of risk such as more frequent tornados  hail storms  and ice storms but these types of events are generally more geographically concentrated and help mitigate the risk of the widespread exposure posed by atlantic and gulf coast hurricanes 
another challenge posed by the events of that will have an impact on future earnings of the property and casualty subsidiaries is the cost that we pay for catastrophe reinsurance 
we incurred an increase in catastrophe reinsurance in of as a result the frequency of storm related losses over the last two years 
in addition  we had to increase our catastrophe deductible by to  in order to keep the increase in catastrophe reinsurance rates to only 
this has necessitated that we increase rates in many of the areas we serve 
our reinsurance rate increase took effect january  unfortunately  due to regulatory hurdles and backlogs created from a large number of other insurers filing revised rates in the affected states as well  we will be unable to reflect the increased reinsurance rates we pay in rates charged to our insured for up to a year 
this will result in a drag on earnings of approximately  pre tax 
however  we believe that the short term earnings drag will be offset by increased pricing power and less competition in many of the areas impacted by the hurricane season 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty premium revenues totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of 
the significant growth in premium revenue over the past four years has been achieved through several different methods including an acquisition in  increased marketing efforts in states outside of alabama  and careful monitoring and increasing of rates in order to achieve underwriting profitability 
the homeowners line of business was the largest contributor to the increase in premium revenue 
gross written premium from the homeowners market for the p c subsidiaries totaled  in and has grown to  in written premium in  a compound growth rate over four years 
several factors have contributed to this growth including  the development of a new homeowners product launched in  an upgrade to an existing homeowners product that made the product more competitive  and favorable market conditions that have allowed pricing of the product to achieve more attractive margins 
significant premium growth has also been achieved in nsfc s traditional dwelling fire market 
dwelling fire written premium totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of 
this line of business has also enjoyed robust growth over the last four years and has grown at a compound growth rate since this growth is primarily attributable to favorable market conditions  as many larger carriers do not focus on the dwelling fire market with insured values typically less than  per dwelling 
income before income tax declined considerably in to million compared to million in as discussed earlier  results for were negatively impacted by losses and adverse claims experience related to hurricane losses in the third quarter of claims frequency increased significantly in compared to with claims on dwelling lines of business homeowners and dwelling fire exceeding  claims compared to  claims in over  claims were reported from hurricane ivan so without the impact of ivan  claims frequency was in line with total of around  claims 
average severity on dwelling claims in declined to an average of  compared to  in average severity declined primarily due to the large volume of hurricane ivan claims 
because most of the losses from hurricane ivan were inland and limited primarily to minor wind damage  claims from ivan averaged less than  per occurrence  which skewed average severity downward 
claim adjustment expenses averaged of earned premium in compared to in the slight increase was primarily due to the increase in cost associated with settling claims from hurricane ivan 
the company employs claims adjusters  which work approximately of reported dwelling claims in a typical year with independently contracted adjusters working remaining claims 
in areas with large concentrations of business  it is typically less expensive to use employee adjusters compared to independent adjusters 
due to the large number of claims from hurricane ivan  the company utilized more independent adjusters to handle the increased workload in order to expedite the payment of claims to our policyholders 
p c segment revenue before income taxes was  in compared to  in the decline in pretax earnings was due to losses incurred from hurricane ivan 
pretax losses from ivan  including catastrophe reinstatement premium of  reduced p c segment income before taxes by over  as shown in the combined ratio comparison that follows  the p c companies still managed to achieve a combined ratio below even after the impact of hurricane ivan 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
the combined ratio for compared to increased percentage points 
this increase was entirely due to losses incurred from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita which each added  and percentage points to the combined ratio respectively 
hurricane ivan added percentage points to the combined ratio for leasing operations the company s leasing operations are conducted through its owned subsidiary  mobile attic  inc mobile attic was incorporated in august of and is a joint venture with a manufacturing partner  cash brothers leasing of elba  alabama 
as detailed in note a of the consolidated financial statements on page  the company consolidated its investment in the subsidiary mobile attic  inc mobile attic is in the business of leasing portable storage containers to individual and commercial customers primarily through franchise locations covering alabama and expanding throughout the southeastern united states 
at december  there were franchise locations throughout the southeast and dealerships 
at december  mobile attic had over  storage containers available for lease through franchise and dealer locations 
the portable storage containers are eight feet wide and eight feet tall and are available in lengths of    and feet 
independent dealers market these portable storage containers primarily to household customers in need of a convenient alternative to fixed location mini storage  commercial customers in need of secure storage facilities at job sites  and retail customers for storage of seasonal inventory 
mobile attic began the steps to change its business model during with the goal of future growth to come through expansion of independently owned franchise locations 
expansion through this new avenue will allow mobile attic to venture more rapidly into new areas and expand into larger cities while significantly reducing future capital requirements 
mobile attic began selling franchised locations in the first quarter of with locations in operation or beginning operations as of december  in  mobile attic generated net income of  primarily due to franchise fees generated on the strength of sales of new franchise locations 
as individual franchise locations begin to mature over the next five years  the company expects a shift in revenue away from one time franchise fees to more stable continuing royalty fees which are based on a percentage of individual franchisee rental revenues 
in  mobile attic generated a net loss of  which was primarily related to a decrease in revenues from dealership sales fees and utilization fees below expected ultimate levels coupled with the cost of shifting to a franchise method of establishing new locations 
asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to national association of insurance commissioners naic securities valuation office svo rating standards  and the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of moody s and standard and poor s svo equivalents svo class moody s standard and poor s of total bond portfolio aaa to a aaa to a baa to baa bbb to bbb ba to ba bb to bb b to b b to b caa to ca ccc to c caa to ca c to d as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement and reclassified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held to maturity 
with that reclassification  the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million and million at december  and respectively 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo s and typically avoids investment in cmo s priced at significant premiums above par value 
the results with respect to the foregoing investments are as follows year ended december net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized gains on investments before taxes changes in net unrealized gains on investments before income taxes as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows maturity schedule amounts in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years liquidity and capital resources due to increased claims from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita  the company established a million revolving credit facility with a local bank 
the establishment of the credit facility allowed the company to better manage the timing differences associated with the payment of catastrophe claims to policyholders and subsequent reimbursement of paid claims from reinsurance companies 
the establishment of the credit facility also prevented the insurance subsidiaries from having to liquidate investments for the payment of claims and reinvest proceeds upon reimbursement from reinsurance companies 
due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiaries are typically of a longer duration and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiaries are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investment  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicate that operating activities used provided cash of   and  in   and respectively 
the significant decline in cash flow from operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the significant increase in claims associated with hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita 
cash flow in compared to declined primarily due to the increase in claims associated with hurricane ivan 
the consolidated statement of cash flows also reflects an increase decrease in cash from financing activities of   and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow from financing activities in reflects proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of  the reduction of debt held by mobile attic of million  and the payment of shareholder dividends of  in december of  the national security group completed the issuance of debt through a trust preferred securities offering 
specific details of the offering are discussed on form k filed december  and are incorporated herein by reference 
the primary purpose of the offering was to increase regulatory capital of the primary property and casualty subsidiary  nsfc 
upon receipt of the proceeds of the million debt issuance  the company made an additional capital contribution to nsfc of  over the past five years  nsfc has generated significant growth in premium revenue 
due to losses incurred from four hurricanes over the past two years  regulatory surplus had not kept pace with the rate of premium growth 
in order to put nsfc in a better position to react to opportunities for continued growth going forward  we felt it prudent to boost the regulatory capital of nsfc via the proceeds of the long term debt issuance 
also in december of  the consolidated joint venture  mobile attic paid down debt of approximately  through the sale of portable storage units to new franchisees 
as discussed previously  we do not own a controlling interest in mobile attic but through the existence of certain debt guarantees established in and the subsequent issuance of financial interpretation r by the financial accounting standards board in december of  we are obligated to consolidate mobile attic financial statements 
it is a primary focus of management to continue to reduce mobile attic debt  to remove the impact of the debt guarantees and return the presentation mobile attic financial statements of the company to the equity method 
the company has standby letters of credit of  these letters are used to guarantee obligations of the property casualty subsidiary under assumed reinsurance contracts 
certain invested assets of the company secure the letters of credit 
the company also routinely incurs a liability for declared but unpaid dividends 
long term liquidity needs of the company constitute only those items which are directly related to the principal business operations of the company 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations property and casualty claim reserves long term debt obligations include  in debt held directly by the company 
it is anticipated that  will be retired in included in long term debt held directly by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in for further discussion of the subordinated debentures please review note to the consolidated financial statements and form k filed december  which is incorporated herein by reference 
long term debt obligations also include  in debt held by a owned subsidiary  the mobile attic 
the current debt obligation of mobile attic matures in  but it is currently anticipated that mobile attic will seek to refinance approximately of this debt under a longer term financing prior to maturity 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management feels that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company s claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation  which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s insurance subsidiary assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities  which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
off balance sheet arrangements with the consolidation of owned subsidiary  the mobile attic  inc triggered by preexisting debt guarantees and the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation fin r  the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations  and industry standards 
the company s financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management s opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance receivables deferred policy acquisition costs deferred taxes valuation of investments reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense recognition of revenue evaluation of litigation reinsurance as part our risk management strategy we routinely cede risks associated with insurance policies we underwrite to reinsurers pursuant to contractual agreements 
reinsurance provides protection for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophes  to alleviate fluctuation in the results of our underwriting activities and to limit our net liability for individual risks 
the estimated reinsurance recoverable on paid losses  including an estimate for losses incurred but not reported  and amounts paid to reinsurers applicable to unexpired terms of policies in force are reported as assets 
a reinsurance arrangement does not discharge the issuing company from primary liability to the insured  and the issuing company is required to discharge its liability to the insured even if the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements 
reinsurance  however  does make the reinsurer liable to the issuing company to the extent of any reinsurance in force at the time of the loss 
reinsurance arrangements also decrease premiums retained by the issuing company since that company pays the reinsuring company a portion of total premiums based upon the amount of liability reinsured 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
the estimated recoverable is recorded as an asset on the financial statements 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectibility 
nsic generally reinsures all risks in excess of  with respect to any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
in addition  the property casualty subsidiaries have catastrophe excess reinsurance  which protects it in part with respect to aggregate property losses arising out of a single catastrophe  such as a hurricane 
in  the property casualty subsidiaries had catastrophe protection up to a million loss 
based on an evaluation using actual nsfc and omega exposures and catastrophe modeling based on a year loss  that is a loss that has a less than of chance of occurring in any given year  the property and casualty subsidiaries would pay pre tax million in losses and reinstatement and reinsurers would pay pre tax million 
it should be noted that  due to an increase in reinsurance rates  effective january  the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries incurred an increase in the cost of reinsurance coverage 
also  due to the level of rate increases on the first layer of coverage  which began at  in  we increased our deductible to  for however  management also placed coverage on a book of run off business that was previously not insured under the catastrophe reinsurance arrangement 
catastrophe losses on this book of business exceeded  in each of the last two years 
so  we believe the increase in deductible coupled with the addition of catastrophe coverage to this book of business does not materially change our catastrophe reinsurance profile and is the most cost effective risk management solution in the current rate environment 
also in light of the magnitude of hurricane katrina in  we felt it prudent to increase the top end of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage for for  we will have in place catastrophe reinsurance protection for a single event of up to million in excess of  with one reinstatement

deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions and other costs related to issuing insurance policies  net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety  rather they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management s assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december   we had recorded  as an asset for dac in our financial statements

deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are created when there are differences between assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes  as well as tax credits  net operating losses and other carryforwards 
sfas accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this standard requires management to exercise judgment in determining whether or not the deferred tax asset is realizable 
at december  there is no evidence to suggest to management that the deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  please see note to our financial statements 
valuation of investments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for every investment debt and equity security included in the financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
this evaluation requires significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement 
at december  there were no other than temporary impairments

loss and loss adjustment expense property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management s expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management s reserve estimates are reviewed by independent actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
at december  the recorded liability for loss and loss and adjustment expense was  for more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense  see note to our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements  and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately million 
certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note in the consolidated financial statements presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities  and is incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of loss of principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on net worth for a sustained period of time  and low price to book value or low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the major shift has been a move away from corporate bonds and into government agency issues 
corporate spreads have remained extremely tight relative to agency securities 
due to the tight interest rate spreads  the investment committee has not felt compelled from a risk reward standpoint to increase or maintain the allocation to corporate bonds 
corporate bonds now compose just of bond investments compared to over last year 
in contrast  government securities  primarily agency issues  compose of bond investments compared to last year 
collateralized mortgage obligations  which primarily consist of planned amortization class structures  now compose of bond investment compared to last year 
the company does not anticipate any further major shifts in fixed income investment allocations in the near future
