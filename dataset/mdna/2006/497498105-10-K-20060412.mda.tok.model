our fiscal year is comprised of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january accordingly  fiscal represented weeks ended on january  fiscal represented weeks ended on january  fiscal represented weeks ended on january  introduction we are a leading specialty retailer of home decor in the united states  operating stores in states as of january  our stores present a broad selection of distinctive merchandise  including framed art  mirrors  candles  lamps  accent furniture  accent rugs  garden accessories and artificial floral products 
our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise  as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for giving as gifts 
for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded net sales of million 
our stores offer a unique combination of style and value that has led to our emergence as a leader in home decor and has enabled us to develop a strong customer franchise 
as a result  we have achieved substantial growth and have expanded our store base into different regions of the country 
during the past seven years  we have more than doubled our store base  principally through new store openings 
we intend to continue opening new stores both in existing and new markets 
we anticipate our growth will include primarily off mall locations in major metropolitan markets  middle markets and selected smaller communities 
we believe there are currently more than additional locations in the united states that could support a kirkland s store 
we plan on opening new stores and estimate closing stores in fiscal overview of key financial measures net sales and gross profit are the most significant drivers to our operating performance 
net sales consists of all merchandise sales to customers  net of returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
our net sales for fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal  reflecting sales from the new stores we opened in fiscal as well as sales increases from the stores we opened in fiscal comparable store sales declined for fiscal we use comparable store sales to measure our ability to achieve sales increases from stores that have been open for at least full fiscal months 
increases in comparable store sales are an important factor in maintaining or increasing the profitability of existing stores 

table of contents gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales has four distinct components product cost  freight cost  store occupancy cost and central distribution cost 
product cost comprises the majority of cost of sales  while central distribution cost is the least significant of these four elements 
product and freight cost are variable  while occupancy and distribution costs are largely fixed 
accordingly  gross margin gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced by many factors including overall sales performance 
for fiscal  gross profit decreased to million from million for fiscal gross margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales from of net sales for fiscal  primarily due to heavier than anticipated markdown activity that resulted in higher product cost as a percentage of net sales 
operating expenses  including the costs of operating our stores and corporate headquarters  are also an important component of our operating performance 
compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses 
operating expenses contain fixed and variable costs  and managing the operating expense ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales is an important focus of management as we seek to maintain or increase our overall profitability 
operating expenses include cash costs as well as non cash costs such as depreciation and amortization 
due to the significant fixed cost component of operating expenses  as well as the tendency of many operating costs to rise over time  increases in comparable store sales are typically necessary in order to prevent meaningful increases in the operating expense ratio 
operating expenses can also include certain costs that are of a one time or non recurring nature 
while these costs must be considered to understand fully our operating performance  we typically identify such costs separately on the consolidated statement of operations so that we can evaluate comparable expense data across different periods 
a complete evaluation of our financial performance incorporates not only operating results  but also an assessment of how effectively we are deploying our capital 
we believe that a high return on capital is an indicator of a financially productive business 
accordingly  we evaluate our earnings in relation to inventories and total assets in order to determine if we are achieving acceptable levels of return on our capital 
inventory yield gross profit divided by average inventories and return on assets net income divided by total assets are two of the measures we use 
we use a number of key performance measures to evaluate our financial performance  including the following fiscal year net sales growth comparable store sales growth average net sales per store in thousands average net sales per square foot gross profit compensation and benefits as a of sales other operating expenses as a of sales inventory yield return on assets roa calculated using net sales of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period indicated 
calculated using the gross square footage of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period 
gross square footage includes the storage  receiving and office space that generally occupies approximately of total store space 
inventory yield is defined as gross profit divided by average inventory for each of the preceding four quarters 
return on assets equals net income divided by total assets 

table of contents strategic areas of emphasis the downturn in our financial performance for the last two fiscal years has primarily resulted from declining comparable store sales and decreases in our merchandise margin 
accordingly  a central area of emphasis for fiscal is improving the productivity of our merchandise assortment 
this effort encompasses customer research  assessment of merchandising personnel and department structure  and evaluation of competitive and other factors 
the increase in our store base during fiscal reflected a continued commitment to growth  which accelerated upon completion of our initial public offering in july that transaction enabled us to reduce our debt significantly  which led to a significant reduction in interest expense and the ability to allocate more of our cash toward capital expenditures and working capital for new stores 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  of which million was related to leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures for new stores 
the construction of new stores will continue to be an important part of our strategy in fiscal we plan on opening new stores and closing stores during the upcoming year 
our stores historically have operated primarily in enclosed malls  but in fiscal we opened of our new stores in a variety of off mall venues including lifestyle centers  power centers and outlet centers 
in fiscal  all of our new stores were located in these off mall venues 
at january   we operated of our stores in non mall venues  and we anticipate that substantially all of our new store openings in fiscal will be in off mall venues 
typically these off mall stores have been able to achieve higher sales volumes with lower total occupancy costs than our mall stores 
the following table summarizes our stores and square footage under lease in mall and off mall locations as of january  and january  as of january  as of january  mall off mall total mall off mall total number of stores square footage average square footage per store for the fiscal year ended for the fiscal year ended january  january  mall off mall total mall off mall total average net sales per store in thousands average net sales per square foot calculated using net sales of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period indicated 
another important area of emphasis will be improving the effectiveness of our supply chain 
we commenced operations in a new distribution center in the second quarter of fiscal this facility replaced the three buildings that previously supported our central distribution effort 
the commencement of operations in the new distribution center was accompanied by the implementation of a new warehouse management system as well as investments in material handling equipment designed to streamline the flow of goods within the distribution center 
in fiscal and beyond  our goal is to achieve better labor productivity  better transportation efficiency  leaner store level inventories and reduced store level storage costs as a result of this move and our continued improvement in distribution practices 
our objective is to finance all of our operating and investing activities with cash provided by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit line 
our cash balances decreased to million at january  from million at january  we expect that capital expenditures for fiscal 
table of contents will range from to million  primarily to fund the construction of new stores and maintain our investments in existing stores  our distribution center and information technology infrastructure 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts contained in the financial statements and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion aggregates the various critical accounting policies addressed throughout the financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
cost of sales and inventory valuation our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  net of reserves and allowances  with cost determined using the average cost method with average cost approximating current cost 
we estimate the amount of shrinkage that has occurred through theft or damage and adjust that to actual at the time of our physical inventory counts which occur throughout the fiscal year 
we also evaluate the cost of our inventory by category and class of merchandise in relation to the estimated sales price 
this evaluation is performed to ensure that we do not carry inventory at a value in excess of the amount we expect to realize upon the sale of the merchandise 
we believe we have the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that our inventory values would be materially misstated 
depreciation and recoverability of long lived assets approximately of our assets at january   represent investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
we utilize the straight line method of depreciation and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings are depreciated over years 
furniture  fixtures and equipment are generally depreciated over years 
computer software and equipment is depreciated over years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful lives of the asset or the original non cancelable lease term 
our lease terms typically range from to years 
to the extent we replace or dispose of fixtures or equipment prior to the end of its assigned depreciable life  we could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent our assets are used beyond their assigned depreciable life  no depreciation expense is being realized 
we reassess the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains arising from either the disposition of our assets or the utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed annually and upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances such as anticipated store closings or upcoming lease renewals 
the assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the review includes a comparison of the carrying value of the store assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the store 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future net sales  gross profit and store expense increases and decreases 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in additional impairment charges 
goodwill we account for our goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is not amortized but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
table of contents during each fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
insurance reserves workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance programs are partially self insured 
it is our policy to record a self insurance liability using estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported or paid  based on historical claims experience and trends 
actual results can vary from estimates for many reasons  including  among others  inflation rates  claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations 
we monitor our claims experience in light of these factors and revise our estimates of insurance reserves accordingly 
the level of our insurance reserves may increase or decrease as a result of these changing circumstances or trends 
income taxes we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
stock options and warrants the company applies accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for its stock compensation plans 
these plans are more fully described in note of the financial statements 
compensation cost on stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the company s common stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price 
certain of our stock options require us to record a non cash stock compensation charge in our financial statements 
the amount of the charge is determined based upon the excess of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the stock options 
other options have been granted to employees or directors with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock options which have been granted to persons other than employees or directors in exchange for services are valued using an option pricing model 
the fair value of our common stock is a significant element of determining the value of the stock option or the amount of the non cash stock compensation charge to be recorded for our stock option awards or for non employee stock option grants 
prior to our initial public offering in july  our common stock was not traded on a stock exchange 
to determine the value of our common stock prior to the initial public offering we first considered the amount paid to us for our common stock in recent transactions 
absent a recent sale of our common stock  we obtained a valuation from an independent appraiser 
in each case  the determination of the fair value of our common stock requires judgment and the valuation has a direct impact on our financial statements 
we believe that reasonable methods and assumptions have been used for determining the fair value of our common stock 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations 
the table below sets forth selected results of our operations in dollars and expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal change net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses compensation and benefits other operating expenses depreciation and amortization non cash stock compensation charge operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income net sales 
net sales increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net sales increase in fiscal resulted primarily from the opening of new stores 
we opened new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal  and we closed stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal our net sales also benefited from sales increases from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores  which are excluded from our comparable store base 
the impact of these changes in the store base was offset by a decline of in comparable store sales for fiscal during fiscal  comparable store sales decreased 
comparable store sales in our mall store locations were down for the year  while comparable store sales for our off mall store locations were down 
lower customer traffic was the primary reason for the decrease in comparable store sales 
we attributed the traffic declines to a combination of the challenging competitive environment in the home decor sector as well as our inability to present a compelling merchandise assortment to our customer base 
declines in customer traffic were most evident in our mall stores  as malls generally have been attracting fewer of our core female customers 
key categories that outperformed the prior year included candles  furniture  alternative wall decor  mirrors and textiles 
these increases were offset by declines in art  lamps  garden  gift novelty and seasonal 
the growth in the store base along with sales from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores accounted for an increase of million over the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by the negative comparable store sales performance  which accounted for a million decrease from the prior year 
the comparable store sales performance was characterized by a higher average dollar transaction offset by lower transaction volumes 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal  from for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from higher product cost of sales 
product cost of sales increased during fiscal as a percentage of sales  as we took significant markdowns in an attempt to improve sales 
store occupancy costs increased slightly as a percentage of sales as the comparable store sales decline negatively affected the occupancy ratio  offsetting the benefits we began to achieve from our shift to more off mall real estate  the occupancy rates for which tend to be lower than those for enclosed mall properties 
freight expenses decreased as a percentage of sales  despite rising fuel costs  as we realized savings throughout the year due to the 
table of contents implementation of changes in our store delivery methods 
central distribution costs were unchanged as a percentage of net sales for the year 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits  including both store and corporate personnel  was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or for fiscal the increase in the compensation and benefits ratio was primarily due to the negative comparable store sales performance 
at the store level  we were able to leverage payroll costs slightly versus the prior year by employing tight payroll management in a difficult sales environment 
this improvement was offset by higher payroll costs at the corporate level due to key additions to the management team that occurred during fiscal and fiscal additionally  employee benefits costs increased slightly as a percentage of sales due to higher costs of health care claims 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses  including both store and corporate costs  were million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in these operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the negative comparable store sales performance and the lack of a positive leveraging effect on the relatively fixed components of store and corporate operating expenses 
store level operating expenses increased slightly as a percentage of sales due to greater spending on advertising and promotion as well as increases in expenses associated with the increased penetration of our private label credit card loyalty program 
additionally  utilities costs increased during the year due to rising energy costs and our implementation of a wide area network during the second quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by decreases in storage and related equipment rental costs due to improved distribution efficiencies 
corporate level operating expenses were slightly lower as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
this decline was due to reductions in professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and decreases in travel and corporate level insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization was the result of the negative comparable store sales performance  along with the growth of the store base 
additionally  lease terms for many of our recent off mall store openings have been shorter than the historical lease term for a mall store  resulting in higher amortization expense on the associated leasehold improvements for these stores 
non cash stock compensation charge 
during fiscal  we incurred non cash stock compensation charges related to stock options granted to certain employees in november the charge related to these stock option arrangements amounted to million  or of net sales  for fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
this charge was taken ratably over the vesting period of the november options 
these options were fully vested as of january   therefore there was no charge in fiscal and there will be no additional charge related to these options in future periods

the impact of these changes in the store base was offset by a decline of in comparable store sales for fiscal during fiscal  comparable store sales decreased 
the comparable store sales decline resulted from several factors  including a difficult sales environment in the home d cor sector 
additionally  our merchandise assortments were not sufficiently compelling to customers  particularly in several of our home d cor categories where our inventory mix became overly broad during the second and third quarters of the year 
key categories that outperformed the prior year included primarily novelty gift items and textiles 
these increases were offset by declines in decorative accessories  floral  housewares  frames  and garden 
the growth in the store base along with sales from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores accounted for an increase of million over the prior year

central distribution costs increased slightly as a percentage of net sales due to the transition costs incurred during the second quarter of in connection with our move into a new distribution center 

table of contents compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits  including both store and corporate personnel  was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or for fiscal the increase in the compensation and benefits ratio was primarily due to the negative comparable store sales performance 
in particular  we were not able to reduce hours sufficiently in stores to maintain the ratio at the prior year level 
furthermore  we made several additions to corporate management during in order to strengthen key departments such as merchandising  marketing and store operations 
finally  and to a lesser extent  we experienced increases in health care costs related to our employee health insurance coverage 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses  including both store and corporate costs  were million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in these operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the negative comparable store sales performance and the lack of a positive leveraging effect on the relatively fixed components of store and corporate operating expenses 
additionally  we increased spending on advertising and promotion by approximately million during fiscal as we experimented with various forms of media advertising and other marketing programs in order to drive traffic to our stores 
furthermore  corporate professional fees increased due to the costs associated with our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act 
these costs totaled approximately million for fiscal lease termination charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided notice to our landlords of our intent to terminate the leases on our existing central distribution facilities 
consequently  upon providing that notice  we recorded a one time charge of million related to the penalties associated with those early terminations 
no such charge was recorded during fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization was the result of the growth of the store base and the increased capital costs associated with our move to a new distribution center during the second quarter of non cash stock compensation charge

as a result of the foregoing  net income million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal diluted earnings per share was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are for working capital and capital expenditures 
working capital consists mainly of merchandise inventories  which typically reach their peak by the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
capital expenditures primarily relate to new store openings  existing store expansions  remodels or relocations  and purchases of equipment or information technology assets for our stores  distribution facilities or corporate headquarters 
historically  we have funded our working capital and 
table of contents capital expenditure requirements with internally generated cash  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities depends heavily on operating performance  changes in working capital  the timing and amount of payments for income taxes  and the timing of interest payments on indebtedness 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to the decline in our operating performance for the year 
additionally  non cash working capital increased million as we continued our store growth which required incremental inventory investment 
inventory levels increased over the prior year due to a combination of growth in our store base  and a return to more normal beginning of year store inventory levels as compared to the relatively low levels with which we started fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal due to reduced earnings performance 
this decline in earnings was offset by a reduction in inventory of million as we managed inventory levels tightly in response to a challenging sales environment  and ended the year with lean store inventory levels 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts consisted entirely of capital expenditures offset slightly by proceeds received from the sale of certain assets 
these capital expenditures primarily included investments in new store construction  existing store remodels  information technology assets for stores  the distribution center  and the corporate headquarters  and materials handling and related equipment for our new distribution facility  which was occupied in the second quarter of fiscal new store construction comprises the large majority of our capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we opened new stores 
we expect that capital expenditures for fiscal will range from to million  primarily to fund the construction of approximately new stores and maintenance of our investments in stores  information technology  and the distribution center 
we also expect that capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and equipment for our fiscal new stores will average approximately  to  per store 
we anticipate that we will continue to receive landlord allowances  which help to reduce our cash invested in leasehold improvements 
these allowances are reflected as a component of cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal cash flows from financing activities for fiscal were primarily comprised of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility as well as the repayment of a shareholder loan 
the facility was drawn to a peak of million and paid down to zero by the end of the fiscal year 
during fiscal and fiscal  cash flows from financing activities also primarily related to bank revolver activity 
we borrowed to a peak of million and million and paid down to zero by the end of the year for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities also include cash received for exercises of employee stock options  as well as cash paid for issue costs on indebtedness 
revolving credit facility 
effective october   the company entered into a five year senior secured revolving credit facility with a revolving loan limit of up to million 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at a floating rate equal to the day libor rate at january  plus to depending on the amount of excess availability under the borrowing base 
additionally  the company pays a fee to the bank equal to a rate of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets and guaranteed by the company s subsidiaries 
the maximum availability under the credit facility is limited by a borrowing base formula  which consists of a percentage of eligible inventory less reserves 
the facility also contains provisions that could result in changes to the presented terms or the acceleration of maturity 
circumstances that could lead to such changes or acceleration include a material adverse change in the business or an event of default under the credit agreement 
the facility has one financial covenant that requires the company to maintain excess availability under the borrowing base  as 
table of contents defined in the credit agreement  of million at all times 
the facility matures in october as of january   we were in compliance with the covenants in the facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
at january   our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million and the borrowing availability under our facility was million net of the million availability block as described above 
we believe that these sources of cash  together with cash provided by our operations  will be adequate to carry out our fiscal plans in full and fund our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations 
the following table identifies payment obligations for the periods indicated under our current contractual arrangements 
the amounts set forth below reflect contractual obligations as of january  the timing and or the amount of the payments may be changed in accordance with the terms of the contracts or new contractual obligations may be added 
payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years more than years dollars in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations total operating leases consist of future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases and does not include future minimum sublease rentals 
the amounts included above primarily consist of operating leases for our store locations and distribution facilities  but also include operating leases for certain equipment and vehicles 
purchase obligations consist entirely of open purchase orders of merchandise inventory as of january  seasonality and quarterly results we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
we believe this is the general pattern typical of our segment of the retail industry and  as a result  expect that this pattern will continue in the future 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of new store openings  net sales contributed by new stores  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and competition 
consequently  comparisons between quarters are not necessarily meaningful and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results 
our strongest sales period is the winter holiday season 
consequently  we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we purchase large amounts of inventory and hire temporary staffing help for our stores 
our operating performance could suffer if net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain unaudited financial and operating data for kirkland s in each fiscal quarter during fiscal and fiscal the unaudited quarterly information includes all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of the information shown fiscal quarter ended april  july  october  january  net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted stores open at end of period comparable store net sales increase decrease fiscal quarter ended may  july  october  january  net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted stores open at end of period comparable store sales increase decrease inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no
