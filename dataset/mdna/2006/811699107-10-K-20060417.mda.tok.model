item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed at item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of digital video systems and services including the management  aggregation  licensing  storage  and distribution of video  television  gaming and advertisement content to cable system operators  telecommunications companies and broadcast television companies 
we have three reportable segments broadband  broadcast and services 
the broadband segment includes hardware  software and systems  such as our digital advertising and video on demand products that digitally manage  store and distribute digital video for cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
the broadcast segment includes products for the storage  archival  on air playback of advertising and other video programming for the broadcast television industry 
our product revenues are comprised of sales originating from our broadband and broadcast segments 
the services segment is comprised of revenue related to software development  media content services  installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support for the above products 
we have experienced fluctuations in our product revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s receipt of authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  the time required to produce and test the product before delivery  and the customer s required delivery date 
the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs and consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined from product introduction to product maturity 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have historically increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
in the current state of the economy  we currently expect that our broadband and broadcast customers may still have limited capital spending budgets as we believe they are dependent on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
we also expect our operating expenses to increase in sequential periods in the future as a result of consolidating the operating results of liberate s non north american business and odg s business 
in light of the higher proportion of our international business due  in part  to the recent acquisitions of european based business from liberate technologies and odg  we expect movements in foreign currency exchange rates to have a greater impact on our operating results in the future 
our ability to continue to generate revenues within the markets that our products are sold and to generate cash from operations and net income is dependent on several factors which include market acceptance of the products and services offered by our customers and increased subscriber usage and demand for these products and services  selection by our customers of our products and services versus the products and services being offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner and to meet the demands of the market for new products and product enhancements  our ability to maintain gross margins from the sale of our products and services at a level that will provide us with cash to fund our operations given the pricing pressures within the market and the costs of materials to manufacture our products  and our ability to control operating costs given the fluctuations that we have experienced with revenues from quarter to quarter 
in fiscal our total revenues declined to million compared to growth in fiscal the decrease in revenues is primarily attributed to a decrease in product revenues to million in fiscal as compared to a increase in fiscal the decline in product revenues was offset by an increase in services revenues which grew by to million in fiscal as compared to growth in fiscal the growth in services revenue is primarily attributable to the media content services provided by the on demand group odg which was acquired in september and from growth in maintenance and technical support services to our expanding base of equipment installed at customer sites 
the product revenue decline in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower revenues from video on demand product sales  with total sales of million recorded in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and broadcast product sales of million recorded in fiscal as compared to million recorded in fiscal  partially offset by the new product revenues of million related to our middleware software contracts acquired from liberate technologies in july this decrease in video on demand product revenues primarily reflects a decline in demand by us cable operators  including a significant decline in revenues from our largest us customer  partially offset by increased revenues from the initial deployment of video on demand systems in europe 
we expect video on demand product revenues will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal  depending upon our customers continued expansion of these systems in key regional domestic markets  the success of certain telephony companies in entering the video on demand market  and the continued deployment of video on demand systems to new customers in asia  europe and south america during fiscal we expect sales of broadcast products to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal depending upon the success of our new mediaclient technology which we initially introduced in fiscal our advertising product revenues within the broadband segment increased by to million in fiscal compared to a decrease of in fiscal we believe the increase in advertising product revenues reflects an increase in demand for digital advertising systems  reflecting cable operators replacement of the old analog technology with digital technology 
we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year gross profits decreased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal in comparison to a four percentage point increase in fiscal over fiscal overall lower revenues  offset in part by an increase in higher margin software development contract revenues  contributed to the decline 
in addition  fiscal year gross margins were favorably impacted by the million adjustment to product revenue recorded in connection with the final agreement with comcast see note to financial statements concerning the issuance of incentive common stock warrants 
our services gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting higher revenues on a relatively fixed cost base and the added margin generated from odg media services acquired in september we believe that competitive pressures will continue and our ability to maintain or improve gross margin will be dependent upon maintaining or increasing current levels of revenues and achieving technological advances that will further reduce material costs of sales  and increasing the amount of revenues from higher margin software products as compared to the levels attained in fiscal our operating expenses increased million or in fiscal over fiscal in comparison to a million or increase in fiscal over fiscal this increase is principally attributable to the expansion of our research and development activities and to our acquisitions of the non north america business of liberate technologies and odg in fiscal we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in fiscal as these business acquisitions will be consolidated for the entire fiscal year 
our decrease in revenues and gross margins and the increase in operating expenses and amortization of intangibles resulted in a net loss of million or per share in fiscal as compared to net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal this net loss and loss per share differ from amounts reported in our earnings release  issued march   by an additional  of general and administrative expense recorded in connection with our patent infringement litigation accrual and per share  respectively 
the decline in operating results  the acquisitions of the middleware software technology from liberate technologies and odg  the additional investments in affiliates and the purchase of the acton property were the primary contributors to our million decrease in cash 
we believe there are significant uncertainties about our ability to be profitable in fiscal these uncertainties include the timing and magnitude of orders from new customers located primarily outside the united states and the timing and magnitude of orders from our largest us customer who has represented and of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  it is uncertain as to the extent to which our new broadcast technology will be accepted in its targeted markets 
there also continues to be pricing pressures from our competitors across all our product lines 
revenues for fiscal year are also dependent upon the timely introduction and customer acceptance of new products within each of our product families 
acquisitions the on demand group ltd 
on september   we purchased the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of the on demand group limited odg  a company incorporated under the laws of the united kingdom 
as a result of this purchase  we owned of odg at january  odg is a london based aggregator of television content that provides movies and other television programming for on demand and pay per view services throughout europe 
since  we owned a interest in odg 
the step acquisition of the remaining of outstanding capital stock will provide us with a broader range of video on demand service offerings that complement our existing video on demand products and services 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired the outstanding shares in odg that we did not previously own in exchange for approximately million in cash consideration  including transaction costs of  the purchase agreement also provides for additional contingent consideration if odg meets certain annual performance goals related to net income for three measurement periods over the period from the acquisition date through january  we may pay up to a maximum aggregate contingent consideration of million based on the exchange rate in effect at january   including up to payable in shares of our common stock  par value per share  with the remainder payable in cash provided that the performance goals are met 
the contingent consideration is comprised of three installments  each to be made annually  beginning with the year ended january   for a baseline amount of million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts are subject to upward and downward adjustment based on the actual net income of odg  as defined in the agreement  during these performance periods  provided that the aggregate maximum contingent consideration payable is the sum of these baseline amounts plus million 
the contingent consideration will be recorded as an additional cost of the purchase and charged to goodwill if performance measures are met by odg and it becomes available 
on january   the first earnout measurement period ended  and seachange recorded an additional million of goodwill to reflect the additional payment due within seventy five business days of january   based on the actual performance reported by odg 
as a result of the step acquisition of odg  our ownership interest in filmflex increased to 
filmflex was founded in by odg  columbia pictures corporation limited and the walt disney company limited to provide high quality movies for use in on demand service 
each investor owns of filmflex and the investment agreement includes a put option for odg and a call option for the other two investors for the sale of odg s ownership percentage provided certain conditions are met 
if either of these options is exercised and the sale price exceeds a certain threshold  twenty percent of the proceeds will be recorded as additional consideration paid for the step acquisition of odg and charged to goodwill 
prior to the acquisition on september   we accounted for our odg under the equity method of accounting 
our proportionate share of equity income loss in odg was recorded two months in arrears 
as a result  our equity income loss included in the consolidated statement of operations included of odg s net income loss for the nine months ended august  the acquisition was accounted for as a step acquisition under the purchase method of accounting which requires that of odg s net assets be recorded at historical cost and that of its net assets be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date 
the financial position and results of operations of odg have been consolidated subsequent to the acquisition date 
for a further discussion of the accounting treatment of the transaction  see note of the accompanying financial statements 
non north american business of liberate technologies 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of liberate technologies business outside of north america 
at the time of the transaction  liberate technologies was a leading provider of software for digital cable systems 
the acquisition enables seachange to combine liberate s software that enables television set top boxes to operate efficiently in a video on demand system with seachange s digital video delivery systems and video on demand applications 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired certain customer contracts  patents and other intellectual property  and assumed certain liabilities related to liberate s business outside of north america in exchange for approximately million in cash consideration 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the financial position and results of operations of liberate technologies former non north american business have been consolidated subsequent to the acquisition date 
for a discussion of the accounting treatment of the transaction  see note of the accompanying financial statements 
zq interactive  ltd 
in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of zq interactive  ltd  a company incorporated in the british virgin islands with its principal office in shanghai  china  for million in cash and a note payable 
accordingly  the financial position and results of operations of zq interactive have been consolidated subsequent to the acquisition date 
for discussion of the accounting treatment of this transaction  see note of the accompanying financial statements 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
basis of consolidation 
the company consolidates the financial statements of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all inter company accounts are properly eliminated in consolidation 
seachange also holds minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance 
the company evaluates its equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine whether the guidelines of fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised under fin r should be applied in the financial statements 
fin no 
r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
the company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary for any variable interest entities as of january  the company s investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
the investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common shares of the affiliate  seachange s proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate are included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
revenues from sales of hardware  software and systems that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
installation  training  project management  and video on demand services revenue is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from product maintenance and technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
customers are billed for installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale 
revenue from software development contracts that include significant modification or customization  including software product enhancements  is recognized on efforts expended in relation to the overall efforts for the project to the extent billable and the sales arrangement 
efforts are measured based on the time expected to be incurred 
for contracts where some level of profit is assured but we are only able to estimate ranges of amounts of total contract revenue and total contract cost  we use the lowest probable level of profits in accounting for the contract revenues and costs 
shipping and handling costs and service expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenues and cost of revenues 
our share of intercompany profits associated with sales and services provided to affiliated companies are eliminated in consolidation  in proportion to our equity ownership interest 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware  software  systems and services in multiple element arrangements 
hardware  software and systems sales always include at least one year of free product maintenance and technical support services 
revenues under multiple element arrangements are allocated to all undelivered elements of the sales arrangement based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to undelivered elements  which may include  project management  installation  training  maintenance and technical support and certain hardware and software components are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to the sale of hardware  software and systems reflects the residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to the undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements 
the amount allocated to installation  training and product management revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
installation  project management  and training services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements that include software licenses and services where vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist to allocate a portion of the fee to the undelivered element  and the only undelivered element is product maintenance and technical support  the entire fee under the multiple element arrangement is recognized ratably over the period during which the product maintenance and technical support is expected to be performed 
for transactions in which consideration  including equity instruments  is given to a customer  we account for the value of this consideration as a reduction in revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the fair value for each element 
we recognize revenue for product and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
our finance management regularly monitors payments from our customers and assesses any collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition but generally do not require collateral 
for some of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
we maintain allowances for specific doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit assessments  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal  we entered into a video on demand purchase agreement and a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with comcast corporation comcast 
as part of these agreements  comcast was issued common stock and earned incentive common stock purchase warrants based on the number of cable subscribers being served by our equipment which had been purchased by comcast 
we determined the fair value of the common stock and the incentive common stock purchase warrants using the black scholes valuation method and amortized this fair value as an offset to gross revenue in proportion to the revenue recognized from the sale of the equipment to comcast 
the assumptions used in this valuation included a weighted average volatility factor  a dividend yield  a risk free interest rate and an expected warrant term 
if management had used another valuation method or different valuation assumptions  the fair value of the common stock and the warrants may have significantly changed  which could have materially impacted our results of operations 
during the year ended january   comcast earned the remaining common stock purchase warrants available under the agreement 
in october  we issued comcast the remaining  incentive common stock purchase warrants 
the original estimate of the value of the warrants was based on management s determination that comcast earned the incentive common stock warrants when our video on demand equipment was delivered to comcast and we recorded the revenue 
we agreed to revise the number of incentive common stock purchase warrants to be issued at each of the determination dates defined above when we reached a final agreement with comcast on when the warrants were earned 
as a result of the adjustment  we determined that the estimated fair market value of the incentive common stock purchase warrants was lower than the amount previously recorded which resulted in a million reduction in the accrual estimate with an offsetting increase in product revenues in the accompanying statement of operations for the fiscal year ended january  no further adjustments were made in the fiscal year ended january  in connection with the warrants issued to comcast 
inventories and reserves for obsolescence 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components  subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of our hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
we depend upon certain vendors for the manufacture of significant components for all of our products 
if these vendors were to become unwilling or unable to manufacture these products in required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable alternative vendors 
the inability to develop alternative sources  if required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing  finance and operations personnel monitor quarterly the inventories to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we record charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  when an impairment is identified through the quarterly management review process 
obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand components  subassemblies and finished products  is written down to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
in the fiscal years and  we recorded inventory write downs of  and  primarily as a result of management s termination of certain product development initiatives 
for inventory that has been written down to its net realizable value  we release the reserve upon sale or disposal of this inventory 
investments in affiliates 
investments in affiliates include equity investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method of accounting 
for investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the affiliate  the investments are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common stock of the affiliate  our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate is recorded as equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether an investment is more accurately reflected using the cost or equity method 
we periodically review indicators of the fair value of our investments in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  may suggest an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
the carrying value of an investment in an affiliate may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
accounting for acquisitions 
we have completed business acquisitions that resulted in goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our accounting for acquisitions involves judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the estimates of fair values of certain acquired intangible assets which may involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  of acquired tangible acquired assets  of assumed liabilities and contingencies  and the estimated useful lives of acquired long lived assets  and the accounting for income taxes in purchase accounting 
the values we record for goodwill and other intangible assets represent fair values calculated by primarily using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
such valuations depend upon significant estimates and assumptions that are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
these estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired products or services  and discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets  as discussed below  may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment 
changes in assumptions and estimates related to acquisitions could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets 
other long lived assets include million of property and equipment  million of intangible assets and million of purchased software development for resale as of january  goodwill  of million as of january   was acquired primarily through the purchases of odg and liberate 
whereas  the substantial majority of intangible assets were acquired in fiscal and are subject to amortization  the software  which was acquired in fiscal and fiscal  is currently expected to begin amortization in the first half of fiscal we periodically review for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  that may suggest an asset is not recoverable that is  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
factors we consider important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market  and a reduction in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
our cash flow projections contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
we believe there is no impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets as of january  accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets in the future is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax expense benefit  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax income in future periods 
as of january   we maintained a full valuation allowance of million against our us deferred tax assets primarily due to the significant pre tax loss that was recorded in fiscal and the significant ongoing uncertainties surrounding the ability of the us entity  seachange international  inc  to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
in addition  seachange maintains a valuation allowance for the full amount of certain foreign tax assets 
we assessed the need for the valuation allowance as of january  based on all available evidence 
the significant uncertainties surrounding the ability of the us entity to generate pre tax income in future years includes the timing and magnitude of orders from new customers located primarily outside the united states and from our existing world wide customer base 
in addition  there may continue to be pricing pressures and competitive new products from our existing competitors across all our product lines 
revenues for fiscal year are also dependent upon the timely introduction and customer acceptance of new products within each of our product families 
we expect to obtain and evaluate additional information available in fiscal that may provide sufficient evidence for us to reassess whether some portion or all of our us deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we established reserves for uncertain tax positions that reflect our best estimate of the transactions and deductions that we may be unable to sustain or that we could be willing to concede as part of a broader tax settlement 
we are subject to undergoing routine tax examinations by federal and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
tax authorities periodically challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns 
we do not expect the outcome of these examinations  either individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
accounting for contingencies 
we are subject to certain claims and litigation  including proceedings under government laws and regulations and commercial disputes relating to our operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
we review and determine which liabilities  if any arising from these claims and litigations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
loss contingency liabilities are recorded for these contingencies based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside counsel when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
in fiscal  we recorded charges of million associated with an unfavorable jury verdict in connection with the litigation with ncube  million of this amount was for accrued settlement costs 
on april  the us district court granted ncube s motions for damages  attorneys fees  costs and interest of million as of january  our reserve has been adjusted as of january  to fully cover these costs 
we expect to make full payment of these expenses in the quarter ending april  off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital or incurring debt 
other than our equity investment in casa systems and filmflex see note included in the consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources  we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  product revenues 
our product revenue consists of sales of hardware  software and systems from our broadband and broadcast segments 
year ended january  broadband revenues video on demand products advertising products middleware products total broadband revenues broadcast revenues total product revenues our total product revenues decreased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal  decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal advertising product revenues were million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  video on demand product revenues decreased to million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  revenues from video on demand product for the fiscal year ended january  were increased by million for the adjustment recorded in connection with the final agreement with comcast see note to financial statements concerning incentive common stock purchase warrants 
the decrease in broadband revenues reflects a decline in demand by us cable operators  including a significant decline in revenues from our largest us customer and price decreases partially offset by increased revenues from the initial deployment of video on demand systems in europe and the new middleware software revenues of million from customer contracts acquired from liberate technologies 
this decrease was also partially offset by an increase in revenues from our advertising products due to an increase in demand for digital advertising systems  reflecting cable operators replacement of the analog technology with digital technology 
broadcast product revenues were million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues during the fiscal year ended january  was primarily attributable to the delay in the introduction and initial customer acceptance of the new products 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our video on demand products as international cable companies and telecommunications companies  both in north america and internationally  begin to deploy video on demand systems  north american cable companies continue to expand their existing deployments of video on demand systems and we expand our existing product line of video on demand products with new products and services 
if revenues from broadcast and video on demand products increase  the advertising products may become a smaller portion of total product revenues 
however  we believe that there will continue to be an increased demand for digital advertising insertion systems offset by a decline in demand for the older analog based advertising insertion systems 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support  software development  and movie content services 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in service revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of product maintenance and technical support service contracts from our expanding installed base of products and million of revenues from odg s video content services recorded since the acquisition of odg in september software development and professional services revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary  digital video arts  increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from services are expected to continue to grow from our expanding installed base of products  our digital video arts software development business  additional service offerings  and from the consolidation of odg s on demand video content services throughout fiscal for the fiscal years ended january  and  one customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
this customer accounted for and of revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
revenue from this customer was primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
international products and services revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
both us and united kingdom customers accounted for more than of total revenue in fiscal the us was the only country to account for more than of total revenues in fiscal revenues from european customers increased from million to million in the fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
the increase in european revenues was primarily attributable to uk customers 
the increase in revenues from the united kingdom is primarily due to the expansion of the video on demand system deployments by united kingdom cable operators  software revenues generated from our uk customer contracts recently acquired from liberate technologies  and the service revenues from the video content services provided by on demand group since its acquisition 
we expect that international products and services revenues will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
since substantially all of our product sales are made in united states dollars usd  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
however  due to the acquisition of the odg business  which has designated the british pound sterling bps as its functional currency  we expect greater exposure to fluctuations in the usd bps exchange rate in the future 
product gross profit 
costs of product revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased material components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses 
costs of product revenues decreased to million  or of related product revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million  or of related product revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  in the fiscal  the decrease in the costs of product revenues primarily reflects the decrease of the video on demand systems revenue 
we expect the cost of revenues for the video on demand products within the broadband segment to vary as a percentage of related product revenues as our revenue levels continue to change significantly 
product gross profit for the broadband segment decreased from of related revenues in fiscal to of related revenues in fiscal the decrease in broadband gross profit percentages is primarily due to lower video on demand product revenues offset in part by an increase in software revenues from customer contracts recently acquired from liberate technologies 
product gross profit for the broadcast segment was down from of related product revenues in fiscal year to of related product revenues in fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to lower revenues  higher discounts on certain broadcast orders as a result of competitive pressures and the additional cost of sales necessary to enhance the performance of certain systems 
while our ability to maintain or improve our product gross profit as a percentage of product revenues could be impacted by competitive price pressures in broadcast in fiscal  we expect gross profit to improve in fiscal due to a better product mix of hardware and higher margin media client software 
services gross profit 
cost of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support  software development  project management provided by us and costs associated with providing video content services 
costs of services revenues increased from million or of services revenues in the year ended january  to million or of services revenues in the year ended january   primarily due to additional costs of services generated as a result of the acquisition of odg in september the increase in services gross profit was primarily due higher revenue levels and a relatively fixed cost base and the added margin generated from the on demand group revenues recognized since the acquisition in september we expect that service gross profit percentage will continue to increase in the future due to the growing installed base of systems and higher margin new media content services  but may be adversely impacted by the timing of costs associated with our ongoing investment required to expand our service organization in order to support our installed base of systems  our new products and additional media service requirements 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  primarily due to the hiring of additional development engineers to support new product initiatives million and additional development costs incurred by odg  after its acquisition date 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in fiscal year as we continue our development of our new products and enhancements and as we record a full year of odg research and development expenses 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased tradeshow and travel expenses related to increased direct sales efforts partially offset by reduced sales commissions on lower revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
in the fiscal year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  due to million of higher accounting and consulting fees associated with the company s acquisitions and investments in affiliates and compliance with sarbanes oxley legislation  million to further develop operations on a world wide basis and particularly in china  and  additional general and administrative expenses incurred by odg after the acquisition date 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed charges related to the retirement agreement for our chief financial officer due to the execution of a management transition agreement which continues his employment through january  with no retirement benefits 
the fiscal year general and administrative expenses differ from the amount reported in our earnings release  issued march   by an additional  of interest expense recorded in connection with our patent infringement litigation accrual 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended in january  this increase in amortization of intangibles is primarily due to the acquisitions of intangible assets acquired from liberate technologies non north american business in july and from the step acquisition of odg in september we currently expect amortization of intangibles assets in the amount of million for fiscal interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  we recorded an  adjustment  net of taxes to reduce interest income to properly account for the amortization of market premiums and discounts on acquired marketable securities 
equity income loss in earnings of affiliates 
equity income in earning of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  and equity loss in earnings of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  for fiscal  the equity income in earnings of affiliates consisted of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of odg until we purchased of the company in september as part of the odg acquisition  we also increased our ownership interest to in filmflex for which we recorded our proportionate ownership share of its net loss since the acquisition date 
for fiscal  the equity loss in earnings of affiliates consisted of our proportionate ownership share of the net loss of odg under the equity method of accounting 
we currently expect equity income from our investment in filmflex for fiscal income tax expense benefit 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded a million income tax benefit that is primarily attributable to operating losses generated during the current fiscal year that are expected to be carried back to recover prior year taxes paid 
at january   we provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of net deferred tax assets recorded in the united states due to the uncertainty of realization of those assets as a result of the current fiscal year s pre tax losses and uncertainties related to our ability to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
in addition  seachange maintains a valuation allowance for the full amount of certain foreign tax assets 
we have experienced a significant decline in product revenues since the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was primarily attributable to a decline in video on demand systems revenues that subsequently resulted in lower gross margins and net losses 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we determine that we can generate sufficient future pre tax income  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be recognized 
income tax expense for fiscal year included a million benefit primarily related to the implementation of a tax law change relating to the tax treatment of deferred revenues which resulted in the realization of an associated deferred tax asset and a corresponding valuation allowance release as seachange began to follow the same method for both book and tax purposes for recognizing revenue for maintenance service contracts 
seachange had an effective income tax rate of for the year ended january  before recording the adjustment discussed above 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  product revenues 
year ended january  broadband revenues video on demand products advertising products total broadband revenues broadcast revenues total product revenues our product revenues increased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal advertising product revenues were million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  video on demand product revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  revenues from video on demand products for the fiscal year ended january  were increased by million for the adjustment recorded in connection with the final agreement with comcast see note to financial statements concerning incentive common stock purchase warrants 
revenues from video on demand products for the fiscal year ended january  were reduced by the amortization of million  related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the decrease in broadband revenues is primarily attributable a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for advertising insertion offset in part by increased deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states by cable operators 
we experienced a significant decline in revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the first three quarters of fiscal the decline in revenues in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a decline in video on demand revenues due to unanticipated delays in the order receipt  shipment and acceptance of certain orders 
in addition  during fiscal  our video on demand prices decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
however  the effect on our product gross profit as a result of this video on demand price decrease was offset by a reduction in material costs on certain components and other technological advancements 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in broadcast revenues for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily attributable to capital purchases by broadcast companies in asia 
services revenues 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of product maintenance and technical support service contracts  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services and the impact of a growing installed base of product 
revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary  digital video arts  increased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  for the years ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
the increase in international revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the initial deployments of residential video on demand systems in both europe and asia 
no individual country except the us accounted for more than of total revenue 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not experienced any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
product gross profit 
costs of product revenues decreased to million  or of product revenues  in the year ended january  as compared to million  or of product revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  in the fiscal year ended january   the decrease in the costs of product revenues primarily reflects higher product revenues within the video on demand and broadcast products offset by lower material costs on video on demand and advertising products 
our ability to maintain or improve our current gross profit as a percentage of product revenues will be impacted by competitive price pressures which may result in lower average selling prices in fiscal gross profit for the broadband segment increased from of revenues for the fiscal year ended january  to of revenues for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in broadband gross profit percentages is primarily due to higher video on demand product revenues and lower material costs on certain components for video on demand product due to technological advances and the adjustment related to the issuance of the incentive common stock purchase warrants to comcast see note to the financial statements offset in part by a decrease in video on demand prices of approximately 
gross profit for the broadcast segment was flat for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
product gross profit for fiscal year was negatively impacted by the significant decline in product revenues in the fourth quarter primarily resulting from a decline in video on demand revenues due to unanticipated delays in the order receipt  shipment and acceptance of certain orders 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues increased from million  or of services revenues  in the year ended january  to million  or of services revenues  in the year ended january   primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel to support the growing installed base of customers throughout the world 
the increase in services gross profit was primarily a result of higher revenues on a relatively fixed cost structure 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  primarily due to the hiring of additional development engineers to support new product initiatives 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher travel costs related to increased direct sales efforts 
general and administrative 
in the fiscal year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  included the recovery of  of the  provision recorded in the fiscal year ended january  for outstanding amounts owed by adelphia as a result of events that took place during fiscal related to adelphia s announcement of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy and our ability to sell the adelphia receivables to a third party 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended january  of million  or of total revenues  were million higher than the fiscal year ended january  due to higher accounting and consulting fees associated with the compliance with sarbanes oxley legislation and higher legal costs related to the ncube litigation see note to the accompanying financial statements 
amortization of intangibles 
in the fiscal year ended january  amortization of intangibles was million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  historically  these amounts have been included in general and administrative expense but have been broken out separately for presentation purposes 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  equity income loss in earnings of affiliates 
equity income in earning of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  and equity loss in earnings of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january  and  the equity income loss in earnings of affiliates consists of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of odg under the equity method of accounting 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
income tax expense for fiscal year included a million benefit primarily related to the implementation of a tax law change relating to the tax treatment of deferred revenues which resulted in the realization of an associated deferred tax asset and a corresponding valuation allowance release as seachange began to follow the same method for both book and tax purposes for recognizing revenue for maintenance service contracts 
seachange had an effective income tax rate of for the year ended january  before recording the adjustment discussed above 
for the year ended january   the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of the company s remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as of january   we continued to record a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets primarily due to the uncertainties related to our ability to continue to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited financial information for the quarterly periods in the fiscal years ended january  and january  the fiscal year operating expenses differ from the amount reported in our earnings release  issued march   by an additional  of interest expense recorded in connection with our patent infringement litigation accrual 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results  and we believe that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
three months ended april  july  october  january  april  july  october  january  in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross profit operating expenses net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted we have experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers  and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced variations in our revenues from primarily related to the decline in our revenues from video on demand and broadcast products  partially offset by revenues contributed by acquisitions completed during fiscal we have also experienced significant variations in our quarterly product gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
during the last two quarters of fiscal  our services gross margin was positively impacted by the higher margins from the odg business acquired in september during the quarterly periods outlined above  we generally experienced sequential increases in our operating expenses 
operating expenses  also vary somewhat with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel  the acquisition of businesses  and general economic conditions 
our selling and marketing costs fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of commissions related to our revenues  large tradeshows that take place in the first and third quarter of the year and significant promotional costs that are incurred for new product introductions 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on our operating results if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the forgoing  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from sales of our common stock and cash flows generated from operations 
during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at january  to million at january  largely due to cash used in operating activities and investing activities  including our net loss  the acquisitions of liberate and odg  the equity investments in casa systems  minerva networks  insite one  and the purchase of the acton facility 
working capital decreased to million at january  from million at january  net cash used in operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended january  the net cash used for operating activities in the fiscal year ended january  was the result of a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million  and the changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
the significant changes in assets and liabilities that used cash from operations included an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of million  primarily attributable to accounts receivable and unbilled receivables from odg and liberate  our newly acquired businesses  an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to the inventory reclassified to fixed assets for use as research and development equipment  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million which included million of acquired software for resale 
these items that used cash from operations were offset by decreases in accrued expenses and customer deposits of million and million  respectively 
it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience significant increases or decreases in our inventories as a result of the timing of the procurement of components for anticipated orders for both our product segments and increases or decreases in our accounts receivable balances and customer deposits as a result of the timing of receiving customer orders during the period and of customer payments 
we expect that the video on demand products within the broadband segment will continue to require a significant amount of cash to fund future product development and additional capital expenditures for engineering equipment  quality systems and customer services test systems to meet higher forecasted revenue levels 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  and million for the fiscal year ended january  investment activity for fiscal consisted primarily of the million acquisition of substantially all of the assets of liberate technologies non north american business  the million step acquisition of odg  net of cash acquired  capital expenditures of million  including the purchase of land and a building for our new corporate headquarters in acton  massachusetts  and investments in casa systems of million and insite one  inc of million  partially offset by net maturities and sales of marketable securities  the repayment of a loan by an affiliate and a release of restricted cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  the cash provided by financing activities included approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayments of capital lease obligations of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we renewed our revolving line of credit with citizens bank a subsidiary of the royal bank of scotland group plc for a two year period ended december   and increased the committed amount from million to million 
loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s prime rate which was on january  borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement requires that we provide citizens bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization on a trailing twelve month basis  when amounts are outstanding under the loan agreement 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we renewed our revolving line of credit with citizens bank a subsidiary of the royal bank of scotland group plc through june   for the committed amount of million 
as of january   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants but obtained a waiver from the bank for the quarter ended january  there are currently no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
on september   we purchased of the outstanding capital stock of the on demand group limited odg  a company incorporated under the laws of the united kingdom 
as a result of this purchase  we owned of odg at january  odg is a london based aggregator of television content that provides movies and other television programming for on demand and pay per view services throughout europe 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired the outstanding shares in odg we did not previously own in exchange for approximately million in cash consideration  including transaction costs of  the purchase agreement also provides for additional contingent consideration if odg meets certain annual performance goals related to net income over three measurement periods ending january  we may pay up to a maximum aggregate contingent consideration of  based on the exchange rate in effect at january   including up to payable in shares of our common stock  par value per share  with the remainder payable in cash provided that the performance goals are met 
the contingent consideration is comprised of three installments  each to be made annually  beginning with the year ending january   for an annual baseline amount of million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts are subject to upward and downward adjustment based on the actual net income related performance of odg  as clarified in the agreement  during these periods  provided that the aggregate maximum contingent consideration payable is the sum of these baseline amounts plus a maximum of million 
the contingent consideration will be recorded as an additional cost of the purchase and charged to goodwill if the performance measures are met by odg and it becomes payable 
on january   the first earnout measurement period ended  and we recorded million of additional purchase price as goodwill based upon odg s net income for the initial annual performance period ended january  payment of this earnout is due within seventy five business days of january  in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of liberate technologies business outside of north america 
at the time of the transaction  liberate technologies was a leading provider of software for digital cable systems 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired certain customer contracts  patents and other intellectual property  and assumed certain limited liabilities related to liberate s business outside of north america in exchange for approximately million in cash consideration 
in june  we purchased for million real property located at nagog park drive in acton  massachusetts 
the building on the property is approximately  square feet  and this site is our new corporate headquarters 
all operations and personnel currently that were located at the facility in maynard  massachusetts were relocated to the new property in acton  massachusetts in february in february  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with insite one  inc insite  an off site medical imaging and data services company 
as part of the agreement  we invested million for million shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock of insite representing approximately of the total capital stock of the insite 
the preferred shares are convertible to common stock based upon defined conversion factors subject to adjustment as defined in the agreement 
in january  we executed a secured loan agreement with casa systems  inc casa  a massachusetts development stage company that specializes in video on demand products within the telecommunications and television markets 
the original total loan commitment was million and  was drawn at the end of fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal  we increased the total loan commitment to million  and casa drew down the remaining million 
in july  we invested million  representing a ownership interest  in casa 
a portion of the purchase price was satisfied by our surrender and cancellation of the million in principal plus accrued interest outstanding pursuant to the secured loan agreement with casa 
the remainder of the purchase price was paid in cash 
the investment was made for shares of casa s convertible preferred stock  convertible at our option into shares of casa s common stock on a one to one basis 
at the time of the investment  we also entered into agreements with casa  its stockholders and its optionholders which grant us the right of first refusal on the issuance of additional shares of casa securities or transfers of stock or options by holders 
in addition  we have a call option exercisable until january  to purchase all of the outstanding stock and options not owned by us for an aggregate price of million 
in january  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with minerva networks  inc minerva  a california based company specializing in software products for the telecommunications and television markets 
as part of minerva s series h preferred financing  we invested million for million shares of preferred stock of minerva representing of the total capital stock of minerva 
the preferred shares are convertible to million shares of common stock under certain conditions as defined in the stock purchase agreement 
at the time of the investment in minerva  we entered into a software license agreement with minerva in which we agreed to purchase from minerva a license for its itv manager software and related source code for million 
we capitalized the purchased software for resale and will amortize the amount over the expected life of the software license and source code starting with the first shipment of the product to a customer 
in may  seachange acquired all of the outstanding stock of zq interactive  ltd  a company incorporated in the british virgin islands with its principal office in shanghai  china  for million in cash 
according to the terms of the purchase agreement  million was paid to the sellers at the signing of the purchase agreement and the remaining million is to be paid to the sellers in two equal annual installments of  on the first and second anniversary dates of the signing of the purchase agreement 
the first installment of  was paid out in july the following table reflects our current and contingent contractual obligations to make potential future payments in thousands payment due by period s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years non cancelable lease obligations purchase obligations acquisition commitments total the purchase obligations include open  non cancelable purchase commitments from our suppliers 
the acquisition commitments primarily include estimated maximum additional contingent consideration obligations in the event odg achieves specified annual performance thresholds in the future 
in addition  exercise of the call option on casa before january would require additional debt or equity financing 
we believe that existing funds combined with available borrowings under the revolving line of credit and cash provided by future operating activities are adequate to satisfy our working capital  potential acquisitions and capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
effects of inflation our management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes

 chapter fas 
fas amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  our adoption of the provisions of fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

sab relating to the adoption of sfas r 
we plan to use the modified prospective method and black scholes multiple option model to adopt this new standard and expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we anticipate that upon adoption of sfas r  we will recognize share based compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
for the historical impact of share based compensation expense  see note summary of significant accounting policies 
uncertainties  including our future share based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behavior  make it difficult to determine whether the share based compensation expense that we will incur in future periods will be similar to the sfas pro forma expense disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the amount of stock based compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods will be reduced by our acceleration of certain unvested and out of the money stock options in january as disclosed in note stock plans of the consolidated financial statements

sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has historically been associated with product sales arrangements denominated in the local currency where the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the us dollar as most of our revenues are in us dollars and operating expenses in europe and asia 
in light of the higher proportion of our international businesses due  in part  to the recent acquisitions of european based business from liberate technologies and odg  we expect the risk of any adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates to have a greater impact on our operating results in the future 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at january  and january   we had outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated debt 
as there were no amounts outstanding at january  and related to variable rate debt  there was no interest rate exposure 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  our long term marketable investments  which are carried at the lower of cost or market  have fixed interest rates  and therefore are not subject to any interest rate exposure 
as a result  we do not currently hedge these market risk exposures 
at january   we had million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities
