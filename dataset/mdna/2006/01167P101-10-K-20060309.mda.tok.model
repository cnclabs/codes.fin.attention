item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
alaska communications systems group we generate revenue primarily through the provision of local telephone services  including o basic local service to retail customers within our service areas  o wholesale service to competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs  o network access services to interexchange carriers for origination and termination of interstate and intrastate long distance phone calls  o enhanced services  o ancillary services  such as billing and collection  and o universal service payments  the provision of wireless services  the provision of internet services  and the provision of interexchange network long distance and data services 
in addition  we provide video entertainment services through our partnership with the satellite operator  dish network 

table of contents local telephone we are the largest local exchange carrier lec in alaska 
basic local service is generally provided at a flat monthly rate and allows the user to place unlimited calls within a defined local calling area 
access revenues are generated in part by billing interexchange carriers for access to the lec s local network and its customers and in part by billing the local customers themselves 
universal service revenues are a subsidy paid to rural lecs to support the high cost of providing service in rural markets 
changes in revenue are largely attributable to changes in the number of access lines  local service rates and minutes of use 
other factors can also impact revenue  including intrastate and interstate revenue settlement methodologies  authorized rates of return for regulated services  whether an access line is used by a business or consumer subscriber  intrastate and interstate calling patterns  customers selection of various local rate plan options  selection of enhanced calling services  such as voice mail  and other subscriber usage characteristics 
lecs have three basic tiers of customers consumer and business customers located in our local service areas that pay for local phone service and a portion of network access  interexchange carriers that pay for access to long distance calling customers located within our local service areas  and clecs that pay for wholesale access to our network in order to provide competitive local service on either a wholesale or unbundled network element une basis as prescribed under the telecommunications act 
lecs provide access service to numerous interexchange carriers and may also bill and collect long distance charges from interexchange carrier customers on behalf of the interexchange carriers 
the amount of access charge revenue associated with a particular interexchange carrier varies depending upon long distance calling patterns and the relative market share of each long distance carrier 
our local service rates for end users are authorized by the regulatory commission of alaska  or rca 
authorized rates are set by the federal communications commission  or fcc  and the rca for interstate and intrastate access charges  respectively  and may change from time to time 
wireless we are the second largest statewide provider of wireless services in alaska  currently serving over  subscribers 
our wireless network footprint covers over  residents  including all major population centers and highway and ferry corridors 
we currently operate a tdma digital network in substantially all of our service areas  and are rolling out a new generation of digital network known as cdma xrtt  which provides customers with improved voice call quality  average mobile data speeds of kbps and provides a platform for the launch of enhanced services 
we began offering cdma xrtt services in several of our service areas in may in june we began offering mobile wireless broadband service based on ev do which enables high speed data connectivity with speeds that burst up to mbps to our wireless markets in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau 
we estimate that the new cdma service currently covers of the state s population of approximately  internet we are the second largest provider of internet access services in alaska with over  customers 
we offer dial up and dedicated dsl internet access to our customers 
we are a single source provider of advanced ip based private networks in alaska 
interexchange we provide switched and dedicated long distance services to over  customers in alaska 
the traffic from these customers is carried over our owned or leased facilities 
video entertainment we provide video entertainment services on a resale basis through our partnership with the satellite provider  dish network 
the current agreement with the provider became effective august and will either be renegotiated or terminate in december 
table of contents critical accounting policies and accounting estimates management is responsible for the financial statements herein and has evaluated the accounting policies used in their preparation 
management believes these policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note description of company and summary of significant accounting policies  in the alaska communications systems group  inc consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion identifies those accounting policies that management believes are critical in the preparation of our financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the possibility that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting the financial statements are those related to the realizable value of accounts receivable  long lived assets in particular  those assets accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  income taxes  stock compensation  network access revenue reserves and litigation reserves 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we use an allowance method to estimate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
as of december  and december   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
actual collection results could vary significantly from management s estimate 
access revenue is recognized when earned 
we participate in access revenue pools with other telephone companies 
such pools are funded by toll revenue and or access charges regulated by the rca within the intrastate jurisdiction and the fcc within the interstate jurisdiction 
much of the interstate access revenue is initially recorded based on estimates 
these estimates are derived from interim financial statements  available separations studies and the most recent information available about achieved rates of return 
these estimates are subject to adjustment in future accounting periods as additional operational information becomes available 
to the extent that disputes arise over revenue settlements  our policy is to defer revenue collected until settlement methodologies are resolved and finalized 
at december   we had recorded liabilities of million related to our estimate of refundable access revenue 
actual results could vary from this estimate 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes reflect the temporary differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that such net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the cumulative valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets was million as of december   which represents of all net deferred tax assets 
our local telephone exchange operations account for costs in accordance with the accounting principles for regulated enterprises prescribed by sfas no 
this accounting recognizes the economic effects of rate regulation by recording cost and a return on investment as such amounts are recovered through rates authorized by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 plant and equipment is depreciated over lives approved by regulators and certain costs and obligations are deferred based upon approvals received from regulators to permit recovery of such amounts in future years 
the company implemented  effective january   higher depreciation rates for its regulated telephone plant for the interstate jurisdiction  which management believes approximate the economically useful lives of the underlying plant 
as a result  the company has recorded a regulatory asset under sfas no 
of million and million as of december  and  respectively  related to depreciation of the regulated telephone plant allocable to its intrastate and local jurisdictions 
if the company were not following sfas no 
 these costs would have been charged to expense as incurred 
the company also has a regulatory liability of million and million at december  and  respectively  related to accumulated removal costs on the local exchange subsidiaries 
if the company were not following sfas no 
 it would have followed sfas no 
for asset retirement obligations associated with its regulated telephone plant 
sfas no 
also requires revenue and costs generated between regulated and non regulated companies not be eliminated on consolidation  these revenues and costs totaled million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
non regulated revenues and costs incurred by the local telephone exchange operations and non regulated operations of the company are not accounted for under sfas no 
principles 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level upon adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment is then measured in the second step 
we determined the fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of this test primarily by using a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
significant estimates used in the valuation include estimates of future cash flows  both future short term and long term growth rates  and estimated cost of capital for purposes of arriving at a discount factor 
at december   we had recorded goodwill of million applicable to our local telephone and wireless segments and intangible assets of million related primarily to our wireless segment  of which none was considered impaired 
as of july   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
as a result of the early adoption of sfas no 
r  and the issuance of restricted stock  we recorded million of stock based compensation for the year ended december  we are involved in various claims  legal actions and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  and have recorded litigation reserves of million against certain claims and legal actions as of december  we believe that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows beyond the amounts already recorded 
estimates involved in developing these litigation reserves could change as these claims  legal actions and regulatory proceedings progress

in november we received a final order from the rca with respect to une l rates for anchorage  retroactive to june  increasing the une l rate from to  and on january   rates increased for une p and une l in fairbanks and juneau from to and from to  respectively 
network access revenue decreased million   for the year ended december   compared to the same period in network access revenue is based on a regulated return on rate base and recovery of allowable expenses associated with the origination and termination of toll calls for our retail and resale customers 
the decrease was primarily attributable to higher than typical settlement adjustments to the prior year interstate access and universal service fund studies 
we expect that network access revenue will decline as a component of local telephone revenue for the foreseeable future 
deregulated and other revenue consists principally of billing and collection services  space and power rents  deregulated equipment sales cpe  paystation revenue  regulated directory listing revenue  and other miscellaneous telephone revenue 
deregulated revenue increased million  or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   as the result of higher billing and collection revenue and an increase in net cpe sales 
consistent with the us telecommunications industry trend  we experienced a loss of local telephone access lines as customers migrated to broadband internet services reducing demand for second lines  migrated to cable telephony  or replaced landline service with wireless service 
during  our primary competitor began deploying cable telephony and switching its une l provisioned subscribers over to its own network 

table of contents wireless 
wireless revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the following growth in subscribers year over year of at december   an increase in average revenue per unit  or arpu  of to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved subscriber mix with a higher proportion of post paid retail subscribers  increased plan revenue  feature revenue  roaming revenue  regulatory surcharges and receipt of competitive eligible telecommunications carrier status cetc funding on january  which added to cellular arpu in  higher gross customer adds  handset upgrades and accessory sales in the year ended december  resulting in million of revenue compared to million for the year ended december   and higher revenue from non acs customers roaming on our network resulting in third party roaming revenue increasing to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively

local telephone 
the components of local telephone expense are plant specific operations  plant non specific operations  customer operations  corporate operations and property and other operating tax expense 
local telephone expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in local telephone expense was the result of a number of factors 
they include  a million prior year charge related to the early extinguishment of an airplane operating lease and lower net charges for inventory write downs  consulting expense and legal reserves of million  million and million  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million in property taxes  million in cost of goods sold  primarily related to our increase in cpe sales  million in advertising  and million in stock based compensation costs associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r and restricted stock grants 
in addition  we also implemented a contractual wage increase for our represented employees of approximately on january  wireless 
wireless expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is driven by support costs for our increase in subscribers and the continued rollout of our new cdma network 
this resulted in increases of million in handset  accessory and data content expense  increase in circuit charges  and a million increase in incremental roaming expense 
we also increased our advertising and third party sales commissions by million to promote our new network build out and premier product line  outsourced our billing and provisioning system resulting in million of additional expense  and recognized million in stock based compensation costs associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r and restricted stock grants 
additionally  in  we adopted a new allocation methodology regarding certain interexchange expenses 
we determined that this allocation would more appropriately match costs incurred to provide wireless end users with long distance service with revenues from those services 
the result is a movement of expense from interexchange to wireless of approximately million for the year ended december  the expense increases in were offset in part by prior year charges related to the termination of our airplane operating lease and reduction of consulting costs of million and million  respectively 

table of contents internet 
internet expense decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a million decline in internal labor which was primarily the result of severance expense in the first six month of  million in isp access and expense reductions resulting from a decrease in dsl access loop costs and network grooming  million decrease in it software maintenance contract costs due to successful renegotiation of contracts  and a million decrease in inventory write offs

the timing and amount of such purchases  if any  will depend upon cash needs and market conditions  among other things 
the senior secured credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants and events of default  including covenants limiting capital expenditures  incurrence of debt  and payment of dividends 
the senior credit facility also requires that we achieve certain financial ratios quarterly 
subsequent to december  we engaged in certain transactions affecting our senior credit facility and our outstanding debt securities

uses our networks require the timely maintenance of plant and infrastructure 
our historical capital expenditures have been significant 
the construction and geographic expansion of our wireless network has required significant capital 
the implementation of our interexchange network and data services strategy is also capital intensive 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  of which million was expended on growth capital including our cdma xrtt build out and the purchase of additional fiber optic capacity  and million was unsettled at year end 
we intend to fund future capital expenditures with cash on hand  through internally generated cash flows  and if necessary  through borrowings under our revolving credit facility

table of contents in january  we issued million shares of our common stock in an equity offering that closed on february  and  through the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option  an additional million shares that closed on march  as a result of these issuances  together with option exercises and espp purchases  we had outstanding million shares as of december  the issuance of these additional shares of our common stock will increase our aggregate annual dividend payments to approximately million annually  based on our current annual dividend policy of per share 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to service our debt  pay our quarterly dividends  fund our operations  capital expenditures and other obligations over the next months 
our ability to meet such obligations will be dependent upon our future financial performance  which is  in turn  subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
outlook we expect that the overall demand for telecommunications services in alaska will grow  particularly as a result of increasing demand for wireless voice and data services following the launch of our cdma xrtt network  growth in demand for dsl and internet access services due to higher business and consumer bandwidth needs  and increasing demand for private network services by government and business on a statewide basis on either a circuit switched or ip basis 
we believe that we will be able to capitalize on this demand through our diverse service offerings on our owned circuit switched and ip facilities  new sales and marketing initiatives directed toward basic voice  enhanced and data services  and offering customers an integrated bundle of telecommunication services including local telephone  wireless  internet  long distance  messaging and video entertainment 
consistent with the us telecommunications industry  we continue to experience losses in local telephone access lines as customers cancel second lines  replace wireline services with wireless  and lines migrate to cable telephony 
our primary une customer has announced plans to migrate most of its anchorage area customers to its own cable telephony plant during the next three years 
consequently  we anticipate that these trends will continue 
the telecommunications industry is extremely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
as an ilec  we face competition from resellers  local providers who lease our unes and from providers of local telephone services over separate facilities 
moreover  while wireless telephone services have historically complemented traditional lec services  we anticipate that existing and emerging wireless technologies may increasingly compete with lec services 
similarly  local and interexchange service competition may come from cable television providers and voice over ip providers 
in wireless services  we currently compete with at least one other wireless provider in each of our wireless service areas 
in the highly competitive business for internet access services  we currently compete with a number of established online service companies  interexchange carriers and cable companies 
in the interexchange market  we believe we currently have less than of total revenue in alaska and face competition from two major interexchange providers 
the telecommunications industry is subject to continuous technological change 
we expect that new technological developments in the future will generally serve to enhance our ability to provide service to our customers 
however  these developments may also increase competition or require us to make significant capital investments to maintain our leadership position in alaska
