overview we design  develop  manufacture  sell and support precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards 
semiconductor manufacturers use our wafer probe cards to perform wafer probe test on the whole semiconductor wafer  prior to singulation  in the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
after the fabrication of a semiconductor wafer  the chips on the wafer are subject to wafer probe test 
during wafer probe test  a wafer probe card is mounted in a prober  which is in turn connected to a semiconductor tester  and the wafer probe card is used as an interface to connect electronically with and test individual chips on a wafer 
at the core of our product offering are our proprietary technologies  including our microspring interconnect technology and design processes 
our microspring interconnect technology includes a resilient contact element manufactured at our production facilities in livermore  california 
we operate in a single industry segment and have derived our revenues primarily from the sale of wafer probe cards incorporating our microspring interconnect technology 
we were formed in and in introduced our first commercial product 
during  we introduced the industry s first memory wafer probe card capable of testing up to devices in parallel 
our revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we work closely with our customers to design  develop and manufacture custom wafer probe cards 
each wafer probe card is a custom product that is specific to the chip and wafer designs of the customer 
our customers  in turn  operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and are subject to severe fluctuations in the demand for their products 
because of the nature of our customers and our business  our revenue growth is driven in significant part by the number of new semiconductor designs that our customers develop  the technology transitions involved in these designs and our customers production volumes 
in the past  this has resulted in our being subject to demand fluctuations that have resulted in significant variations of revenues  expenses and results of operations in the periods presented 
we expect these fluctuations  and the resulting variations in our financial results  to continue in future periods 
in fiscal  we benefited from semiconductor manufacturers strong demand for our products as they continued to replace conventional probe cards with our advanced wafer test technologies 
new applications such as mobile ram and the transition to and sub nanometer technology process nodes and double data rate ii  or ddr ii  architecture contributed to our overall revenue growth  which was partially offset by lower demand for nand and nor flash applications 
as a result  in fiscal our revenues increased by as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we also incurred significant costs associated with the transition to our new manufacturing facility in livermore  california 
we were able to fund the costs associated with this transition from operating cash flow 
the majority of our sales are directly to semiconductor manufacturers 
in fiscal  sales to four customers accounted for of our revenues 
because the semiconductor industry is a relatively concentrated industry  we believe that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our business 
we generally have limited backlog and therefore we rely upon orders that are booked and shipped in the same quarter for about half of our revenues 
our backlog increased from million at december  to million at december  we manufacture our wafer probe cards based on order backlog and customer commitments 
backlog includes only orders for which written authorizations have been accepted  shipment dates within months have been assigned and revenue has not been recognized 
in addition  backlog includes service revenue for existing product service agreements to be earned within the next months 
in addition to direct sales we also have significant sales to our distributor 
sales to our distributor were  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
currently  we have one distributor  spirox corporation  which serves singapore  philippines  malaysia and china 
we also have the ability to sell our products directly to customers in these regions 
prior to october  we sold our products in taiwan through spirox until we transitioned to a direct sales and service model in that country 
management focuses on various external measures that impact our performance  including for example  semiconductor manufacturer technology transitions  semiconductor manufacturing wafer fabrication facility expansions  semiconductor device architecture changes and implementations  and new market developments 
we believe the following information is key to understanding our business  our financial statements and the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations fiscal year 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
the fiscal year ended december  had weeks 
fiscal years ended december  and december  had weeks each 
revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from product sales of wafer probe cards 
wafer probe card sales accounted for of our revenues in fiscal  of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal revenues from licensing of our design and manufacturing technologies have historically been insignificant 
increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products  the introduction of new  more complex products and the penetration of new markets 
revenues from our customers are subject to both quarterly  annual and other fluctuations due to design cycles  technology adoption rates and cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold 
we expect that revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials  payroll and manufacturing related overhead 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes costs related to the start up of our new manufacturing facility 
our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products  some of which are a sole source 
we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders 
tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues 
we expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions or write offs of inventory as cost of revenues 
we design  manufacture and sell a fully custom product into the semiconductor test market  which is subject to significant cyclicality and demand fluctuations 
our wafer probe cards are complex products that are custom to a specific chip design and must be delivered on relatively short lead times as compared to our overall manufacturing process 
as our advanced wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
we record inventory reserve for estimated obsolete and non saleable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserve would be required 
once established  the original cost of our inventory less the related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis of such products 
reversal of these reserves is recognized only when the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering and material costs 
almost all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we devoted  and of our revenues to research and development programs in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development activities to develop new technologies for current and new markets and new applications in the future 
we expect these expenses to scale with revenue growth in the range of to of revenues  excluding stock based compensation 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  internal and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other sales  marketing  and administrative activities 
these expenses also include costs for enforcing our patent rights and regulatory compliance costs 
we expect that selling expenses will increase as revenues increase  and we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to support future revenue growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful receivables  inventories  marketable securities  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies  litigation and accrual for other liabilities 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies note of notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
under securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab  we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales to customers other than distributors are recognized upon shipment or delivery depending upon the terms of sale and reserves are provided for estimated allowances 
we defer recognition of revenues on sales to distributors until the distributor confirms an order from its customer 
in multiple element arrangements  we follow the guidance in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we then allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting principally following sab 
we offer product maintenance and repair arrangements to our customers that are accounted for in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
amounts due from customers under these arrangements are initially recorded as deferred revenues 
the fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period and related costs are recorded as incurred 
revenues from licensing of our design and manufacturing technology  which have been insignificant to date  are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled 
we have to make estimates and judgments with regard to revenue recognition and changes in these estimates and judgments could impact our revenues and results of operations 
warranty reserve 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
from time to time  we may be subject to additional costs related to warranty claims from our customers 
this additional warranty would be recorded in the determination of net income in the period in which the additional cost was identified 
inventory reserve 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  computed on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we record inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserve may be required 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pre tax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in additional income tax expense in such period 
in fiscal and fiscal  given our increasing levels of profitability  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed 
differences between our tax provision and tax return may occur and such adjustments are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities which might result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is judgmental in nature 
however  we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to those matters 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire

as a result  the advanced wafer probe card market grew rapidly in  as new market forces and our enabling technologies accelerated demand 
continuing strength in mobile and consumer applications like mobile ram  the transition to nanometer technologies and below  as well as the transition to ddr ii architecture contributed to the overall growth in revenues 
the majority of our revenues for fiscal was generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
the increase was primarily due to the continued execution of major dram transitions to nanometer technology and below  ddr ii architecture and the proliferation of mobile ram applications 
approximately of our dram revenue in fiscal was derived from nanometer and below technology products 
revenues generated from sales to flash memory device manufacturers decreased mainly due to lower demand for our nand flash wafer probe cards 
revenues from manufacturers of logic devices increased primarily due to increased demand for high parallelism test products 
the majority of our logic revenues in fiscal was derived by sales of wafer probe cards to test high performance flip chip microprocessor and chipset applications 
revenue by geographic region fiscal of fiscal of revenues revenues in thousands north america europe japan asia pacific total revenues geographic revenue information is based on the invoicing location of the customer 
for example  certain korean customers purchase through their north american subsidiaries 
the increase in revenues in north america was primarily driven by demand for wafer probe cards used to test chips for consumer and mobile products 
the increase in the percentage of revenues in japan was primarily due to increased sales to a manufacturer of dram devices 
the increase in percentage of revenues in asia pacific was primarily due to growth in our business with taiwan customers 
the decrease in the percentage of revenues in europe was primarily due to decreased sales to a manufacturer of dram devices in this region 
gross margin fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands gross margin the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to start up costs related to our new factory  costs to ramp our new factory to a higher revenue capacity and higher provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
during fiscal and fiscal we incurred million and million  respectively of start up expenses related to the bring up of our new manufacturing facility  which represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in inventory provision to million  or of revenues for fiscal as compared with million  or of revenues for fiscal was primarily due to excess custom inventory quantities 
as our advanced wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
research and development fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands research and development stock based compensation expense excluded from research and development the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was mainly due to an increase of approximately million in personnel costs and an increase of approximately million in development related costs 
through fiscal  we continued the development of our next generation parallelism architecture and products  fine pitch memory and logic products  advanced microspring interconnect technology and new process technologies 
we are also making incremental investments in new technologies and products as we focus on new market opportunities 
selling  general and administrative fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense excluded from selling  general and administrative the increase in absolute dollars was mainly due to an increase of approximately million in personnel related expenses and an increase of approximately million in outside professional services that primarily related to patent enforcement proceedings and other consulting services  including compliance and regulatory matters 
stock based compensation expense in fiscal increased primarily due to the acceleration of options related to the departure of our chief operating officer 
interest and other income expense  net fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues interest income other income expense  net the increase in interest income is due to larger cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance throughout fiscal relative to fiscal and higher interest rates  resulting in higher interest income earned 
other expense for fiscal was mainly comprised of foreign currency losses  primarily related to japanese yen 
other income for fiscal includes a realized gain contingency relating to a cash refund of consumption tax paid in japan of approximately million 
provision for income taxes fiscal annual effective tax rate fiscal annual effective tax rate in thousands provision for income taxes our annual effective tax rate for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the lower income tax expense for fiscal was primarily due to higher tax exempt interest earned and higher tax credits generated in fiscal fiscal was impacted by certain discrete transactions recorded in the third quarter of fiscal  mainly adjustments of million related to a research and development tax credit study as well as the release of prior year tax reserves with respect to years for which the statute of limitations had been reached 
fiscal years ended december  and december  revenues fiscal fiscal increase decrease change in thousands revenue by market dram flash logic total revenues revenues grew across all regions in fiscal as compared to fiscal as conventional probe cards continued to be replaced by advanced wafer test technologies and more test was performed at the wafer level 
the build out of mm wafer production capacity brought additional demand for wafer probe cards as part of our customers overall capacity expansion 
new applications like mobile ram  the transition to nanometer technologies  as well as design wins in flash memory contributed to the overall growth in revenues 
revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were negatively impacted by approximately million due to a severe decline in our production yields caused by contamination of our existing wafer production line at our old production facility 
the majority of revenues for fiscal were generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
the increase was primarily due to a general increase in customer bit production volume as well as the continued execution of major dram transitions to and sub nanometer technology  megabit density  mm capacity ramps  ddr ii architecture and mobile ram applications 
revenues generated from sales to flash memory device manufacturers increased due to strong bit growth and the demand for high parallelism flash memory test products as well as the continued ramp in mm capacity

gross inventories were million  million and million as of december   december  and december   respectively 
inventory reserves at december   december  and december  were million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in both gross inventories and inventory reserves are a result of increased volume in business and strong demand for our products 
while inventory and inventory reserve balances have increased in  net inventory turns remain high at and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net inventory turns were in fiscal inventory reserves  as a percentage of gross inventories  decreased to at december  compared to at december  inventory reserves  as a percentage of gross inventories were at december  we record inventory reserve for estimated obsolete or non saleable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserve would be required 
once established  the original cost of our inventory less the related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis of such products 
reversal of these reserves  if any  is recognized only when the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
accrued liabilities increased by million for fiscal due primarily to the increase of million in accrued income taxes and increase of approximately million in accrued compensation and benefits 
accrued liabilities increased by million for fiscal due to the increase of million in accrued compensation and benefits 
net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal net cash used by investing activities resulted primarily from the net purchase of marketable securities and capital expenditures in each of these periods 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we invested in the expansion of manufacturing facilities as well as leasehold improvements to our new headquarters and manufacturing facility 
in fiscal  we invested the proceeds from our initial public offering and follow on offering into short term marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal and fiscal was mainly due to proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options 
in  we completed our initial public offering and a follow on public offering 
these public offerings generated million in proceeds 
in may  we signed a ten year lease for an additional  square feet of manufacturing  research and development and office space 
the total rent obligation over the term of the lease is million and is accounted for as an operating lease 
in october  we signed a ten year lease for an additional  square feet of research and development space 
the total rent obligation over the term of the lease is million and is accounted for as an operating lease 
we invested approximately million in leasehold improvements for our new headquarters and manufacturing facility through we expect capital expenditures for fiscal of approximately million primarily related to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities 
the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  payments due by fiscal year after total in thousands operating leases inventory purchase obligations other purchase obligations total we believe that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  and the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity 
accordingly  we may seek additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the requisite service periods 
sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from cash flow as it would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method 
as a consequence  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
although the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or total cash flows  it will affect our net income and diluted earnings per share 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will depend on numerous factors including the amounts of share based payments granted in the future  the valuation model we use to value future share based payments to employees and estimated forfeiture rates 
on april   the sec announced that the effective date of sfas no 
r will be extended to annual periods beginning after june  we will adopt this new standard on january   using the modified prospective method and a black scholes valuation model 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on net income and net income per share 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues  except in japan  and our expenses  except those expenses related to our operations in germany  united kingdom  japan  taiwan and korea  are denominated in us dollars 
revenues and accounts receivable from the majority of our japanese customers are denominated in japanese yen 
we may purchase from time to time forward exchange contracts to hedge certain existing foreign currency denominated receivables 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income when the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
as of december   we had one outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contract to sell  japanese yen for  with a contract rate of japanese yen per us dollar 
the fair value on this foreign currency forward exchange contract as of december  would have changed by  if the foreign currency exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar on this forward contract had changed by 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flow 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts  certificates of deposit or high quality corporate debt obligations and us government securities
