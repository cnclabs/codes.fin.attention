per diluted share 
each of these items is more fully discussed below and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company currently believes its income from continuing operations will be lower in as compared to due primarily to lower expected chemicals operating income in critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventories reserves may be required 
kronos provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory based generally on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable securities carried at fair value or accounted for under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value below its cost basis for marketable securities or below its carrying value for equity method investees that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
at december   the carrying value which equals their fair value of substantially all of the company s marketable securities equaled or exceeded the cost basis of each of such investments 
with respect to the company s investment in the amalgamated sugar company llc  which represents approximately of the aggregate carrying value of all of the company s marketable securities at december   the million carrying value of such investment is the same as its cost basis 
at december   the per share quoted market price of the company s investment in timet the only one of the company s equity method investees for which quoted market prices are available was more than six times the company s per share net carrying value of its investment in timet 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  impairment indicators were present only with respect to the property and equipment associated with the company s waste management operating segment  which represented approximately of the company s consolidated net property and equipment as of december  waste control specialists completed an impairment review of its net property and equipment and related net assets as of december  such analysis indicated no impairment was present as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with such operations exceeded the carrying value of such operation s net assets 
significant judgment is required in estimating such undiscounted cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that the future cash flows reflected in these projections will be achieved 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december  the company has assigned its goodwill to three reporting units as that term is defined in sfas no 

goodwill attributable to the chemicals operating segment was assigned to the reporting unit consisting of kronos in total 
goodwill attributable to the component products operating segment was assigned to two reporting units within that operating segment  one consisting of compx s security products operations and one consisting of compx s michigan  canadian and taiwanese operations 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of the company s annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each such reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the two compx reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections  and the estimated fair value of the kronos reporting unit is based upon the quoted market price for kronos common stock  as appropriately adjusted for a control premium 
significant judgment is required in estimating the discounted cash flows for the compx reporting units 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that compx will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement  the company did recognize a million goodwill impairment with respect to compx s european operations in the fourth quarter of  following compx s decision to dispose of those assets 
the disposal of such operations was completed in january  and therefore the company no longer reports any goodwill attributable to such operations at december  o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  kronos has substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
during the company concluded that the more likely than not recognition criteria had been met with respect to the income tax benefit associated with kronos german net operating loss carryforwards in germany 
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
in addition  the company makes an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while the company may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of its foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  the company would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us in this regard  during compx determined that certain of the undistributed earnings of its non us operations could no longer be considered permanently reinvested  and in accordance with gaap compx recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on such undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
o the company records accruals for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
operating income for each of the company s three operating segments are impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  as summarized below o chemicals allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investees  goodwill and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension and opeb plans and loss accruals 
o component products allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
o waste management allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
in addition  general corporate and other items are impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for impairment of marketable securities and equity method investees  defined benefit pension and opeb plans  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
chemicals kronos relative changes in kronos tio sales and operating income during the past three years are primarily due to i relative changes in tio sales and production volumes  ii relative changes in tio average selling prices and iii relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
selling prices in billing currencies for tio  kronos principal product  were generally increasing during the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  decreasing during the last half of and the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  increasing in the last half of and the first six months of and decreasing during the second half of years ended december  change in millions  except selling price data net sales    operating income operating income margin tio operating statistics sales volumes production volumes production rate as percent of capacity full full average selling prices index percent change in ti average selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates impact of changes in foreign exchange rates in billing currencies thousands of metric tons kronos sales increased million in as compared to due primarily to the net effects of higher average tio selling prices  lower tio sales volumes and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased chemicals sales by approximately million as further discussed below 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies in were higher as compared to when translated from billing currencies to us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased 
kronos sales increased million in as compared to as the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased chemicals sales by approximately million as further discussed below  and higher sales volumes more than offset the impact of lower average tio selling prices 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies were lower in as compared to when translated from billing currencies into us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased in as compared to kronos sales are denominated in various currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap gaap measure 
kronos discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because kronos believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods 
the difference between the and increases in kronos average tio selling prices during and  respectively  as compared to the respective prior year using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  and the decrease and the increase in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure during such periods is due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the above table presents i the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  ii the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure and iii the percentage change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the reconciling item between the non gaap measure and the gaap measure 
chemicals operating income in includes million of income related to the settlement of a contract dispute with a customer 
the million gain recognized represents the present value of the future payments to be paid by the customer to kronos 
the dispute with the customer concerned the customer s alleged past failure to purchase the required amount of tio from kronos under the terms of kronos contract with the customer 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kronos operating income increased million in as compared to as the favorable effect of the higher average ti selling prices and higher tio production volumes more than offset the impact of lower tio sales volumes  higher raw material and maintenance costs and the million gain recognized in discussed above 
tio sales volumes in decreased as compared to  with volumes lower in all regions of the world 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
kronos estimates that overall worldwide demand for tio in declined by approximately from the exceptionally strong demand levels in kronos attributes the decline in overall sales and its own sales to slower overall economic growth in and inventory destocking by its customers 
kronos tio production volumes in increased as compared to  setting a new tio production volume record for kronos for the fourth consecutive year 
kronos operating rates were near full capacity in both periods 
kronos operating income decreased million in as compared to  as the effect of lower average tio selling prices and higher raw material and maintenance costs more than offset the impact of higher sales and production volumes and the income from the contract dispute settlement 
kronos tio sales volumes in increased compared to  as higher volumes in european and export markets more than offset lower volumes in canada 
demand for tio remained strong throughout  and while kronos believes that the strong demand was largely attributable to the end use demand of its customers  it is possible that some portion of the strong demand resulted from customers increasing their inventory levels of tio in advance of implementation of announced or anticipated price increases 
kronos operating income comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher production levels  which increased in as compared to kronos operating rates were near full capacity in both periods 
kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales by a net million in as compared to  and increased sales by a net million in as compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
kronos operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in and as compared to the same periods of the respective prior years 
overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net million increase in kronos operating income in each of and as compared to the respective prior year 
on september   the chloride process tio facility operated by kronos owned joint venture  louisiana pigment company lpc  temporarily halted production due to hurricane rita 
although storm damage to core processing facilities was not extensive  a variety of factors  including loss of utilities  limited access and availability of employees and raw materials  prevented the resumption of partial operations until october  and full operations until late the joint venture expects the majority of its property damage and unabsorbed fixed costs for periods in which normal production levels were not achieved will be covered by insurance  and kronos believes insurance will cover its lost profits subject to applicable deductibles resulting from its share of the lost production from lpc 
insurance proceeds from the lost profit for product that kronos was not able to sell as a result of the loss of production from lpc are expected to be recognized by kronos during  although the amount and timing of such insurance recoveries is not presently determinable 
the effect on kronos financial results will depend on the timing and amount of insurance recoveries 
kronos efforts to debottleneck its production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
such debottlenecking efforts included  among other things  the addition of finishing capacity in the german facility and equipment upgrades and enhancements in several locations to allow for reduced downtime for maintenance activities 
kronos production capacity has increased by approximately over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs  with only moderate capital expenditures 
kronos believes its annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons  with some slight additional capacity expected to be available in through its continued debottlenecking efforts 
kronos expects its operating income in will be somewhat lower than  as the favorable effect of anticipated modest improvements in sales volumes and average tio selling prices are expected to be more than offset by the effect of higher production costs  particularly raw material and energy costs 
kronos expectations as to the future prospects of kronos and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond kronos control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
chemicals operating income  as presented above  is stated net of amortization of valhi s purchase accounting adjustments made in conjunction with its acquisitions of its interest in nl and kronos 
such adjustments result in additional depreciation and amortization expense beyond amounts separately reported by kronos 
such additional non cash expenses reduced chemicals operating income  as reported by valhi  by million in  million in and million in as compared to amounts separately reported by kronos 
changes in the aggregate amount of purchase accounting adjustment amortization during the past three years are due primarily to the effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
component products compx years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income operating income margin component product sales were higher in as compared to principally due to increases in selling prices for certain products across all segments to recover volatile raw material prices  sales volume associated with a business acquired in and the net effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which increased sales by million  as discussed below  partially offset by sales volume decreases for certain products resulting from asian competition 
during  sales of security products including sales of the business acquired in increased as compared to  while sales of precision slide and ergonomic products decreased and  respectively 
the percentage changes in slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
component products sales were higher in as compared to due in part to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased component products sales by million in as compared to  as discussed below 
component products sales comparisons were also impacted by increases in product prices for precision slides and ergonomic products which were primarily a pass through of raw material steel cost increases to customers 
during  sales of slide products increased as compared to  while sales of security products decreased less than and sales of ergonomic products increased during the same period 
component products operating income increased in as compared to as the favorable impact of continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs more than offset the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as discussed below  and higher raw material costs 
component products operating income comparisons in were favorably impacted by the effect of certain cost reduction initiatives undertaken in component products segment profit comparisons were also impacted by the net effects of increases in the cost of steel the primary raw material for compx s products and continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted the company s sales comparisons with as discussed above  and negatively impacted component products operating income comparisons for the same periods by approximately million 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted component products sales comparisons with as discussed above  while currency exchange rate fluctuations did not significantly impact component products operating income comparisons for the same periods 
while demand has stabilized across most of compx s product segments  certain customers are seeking lower priced asian sources as alternatives to compx s products 
compx believes the impact of this will be mitigated through its ongoing initiatives to expand both new products and new market opportunities 
asian sourced competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge 
compx s strategy in responding to the competitive pricing pressure has included reducing production cost through product reengineering  improvement in manufacturing processes or moving production to lower cost facilities  including compx s asian based manufacturing facilities 
compx has also emphasized and focused on opportunities where it can provide value added customer support services that asian based manufacturers are generally unable to provide 
compx believes its combination of cost control initiatives together with its value added approach to development and marketing of products helps to mitigate the impact of competitive pricing pressures 
compx will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales  particularly to the office furniture industry  and to develop value added customer relationships with an additional focus on sales of compx s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems and security products to improve operating results 
in addition  compx continues to develop sources for lower cost components for certain product lines to strengthen its ability to meet competitive pricing when practical 
these actions  along with other activities to eliminate excess capacity  are designed to position compx to expand more effectively on both new product and new market opportunities to improve compx s profitability 
waste management waste control specialists years ended december  in millions net sales operating loss waste management sales increased in as compared to  but its operating loss also increased  as higher operating costs more than offset the effect of higher utilization of certain waste management services 
waste control specialists also continues to explore opportunities to obtain certain types of new business including disposal and storage of certain types of waste that  if obtained  could help to further increase its sales  and decrease its operating loss  in waste management sales increased  and its operating loss declined  in as compared to due to higher utilization of waste management services  offset in part by higher expenses associated with the additional staffing and consulting requirements related to licensing efforts to expand low level and mixed radioactive waste storage and disposal capabilities 
waste control specialists currently has permits which allow it to treat  store and dispose of a broad range of hazardous and toxic wastes  and to treat and store a broad range of low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes 
certain sectors of the waste management industry are experiencing a relative improvement in the number of environmental remediation projects generating wastes 
however  efforts on the part of generators to reduce the volume of waste and or manage waste onsite at their facilities may result in weaker demand for waste control specialists waste management services 
although waste control specialists believes demand appears to be improving  there is continuing price pressure for waste management services 
while waste control specialists believes its broad range of authorizations for the treatment and storage of low level and mixed low level radioactive waste streams provides certain competitive advantages  a key element of waste control specialists long term strategy to provide one stop shopping for hazardous  low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes includes obtaining additional regulatory authorizations for the disposal of low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes 
prior to june  the state law in texas where waste control specialists disposal facility is located prohibited the applicable texas regulatory agency from issuing a license for the disposal of a broad range of low level and mixed low level radioactive waste to a private enterprise operating a disposal facility in texas 
in june  a new texas state law was enacted that allows the texas commission on environmental quality tceq to issue a low level radioactive waste disposal license to a private entity  such as waste control specialists 
waste control specialists has applied for such a disposal license with the tceq  and waste control specialists was the only entity to submit an application for such a disposal license 
the application was declared administratively complete by the tceq in february the regulatorially required merit review has been completed  and the tceq began its technical review of the application in may the length of time that it will take to complete the review and act upon the license application is uncertain  although waste control specialists does not currently expect the agency will issue any final decision on the license application before late there can be no assurance that waste control specialists will be successful in obtaining any such license 
waste control specialists applied to the texas department of state health services tdshs for a license to dispose of byproduct e waste material in june waste control specialists can currently treat and store byproduct material  but may not dispose of it 
the length of time that tdshs will take to review and act upon the license application is uncertain  but waste control specialists currently expects the tdshs will issue a final decision on the license application sometime during there can be no assurance that waste control specialists will be successful in obtaining any such license 
waste control specialists is continuing its efforts to increase its sales volumes from waste streams that conform to authorizations it currently has in place 
waste control specialists is also continuing to identify certain waste streams  and attempting to obtain modifications to its current permits  that would allow for treatment  storage and disposal of additional types of wastes 
the ability of waste control specialists to achieve increased sales volumes of these waste streams  together with improved operating efficiencies through further cost reductions and increased capacity utilization  are important factors in waste control specialists ability to achieve improved cash flows 
the company currently believes waste control specialists can become a viable  profitable operation  even if waste control specialists is unsuccessful in obtaining a license for the disposal of a broad range of low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes 
however  there can be no assurance that waste control specialists efforts will prove successful in improving its cash flows 
valhi has in the past  and may in the future  consider strategic alternatives with respect to waste control specialists 
there can be no assurance that the company would not report a loss with respect to any such strategic transaction

dividends on preferred stock income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle attributable to common stock equity in earnings losses of timet the company accounts for its interest in timet by the equity method 
the company s equity in earnings of timet differs from the amounts that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to timet s separately reported earnings because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by the company in conjunction with the company s acquisitions of its interests in timet 
amortization of such basis differences generally increases earnings or reduces losses attributable to timet as reported by the company  and such increases aggregated million in  million in and million in in  timet effected a reverse split of its common stock at a ratio of one share of post split common stock for each outstanding ten shares of pre split common stock  in timet effected a split of its common stock  in timet effected another split of its common stock 
such stock splits had no financial statement impact to the company  and the company s ownership interest in timet did not change as a result of such splits 
the per share disclosures related to timet discussed herein have been adjusted to give effect to such splits 
timet reported higher sales and operating income in as compared to due in part to higher sales volumes and average selling prices 
timet s average selling prices for melted products ingot and slab increased in as compared to  while average selling prices for mill products increased 
timet s melted product average selling prices in were positively affected by current market conditions and changes in customer and product mix  while mill product average selling prices were positively affected by changes in customer and product mix and by the weakening of the us dollar compared to both the british pound sterling and the euro 
timet s sales volumes of mill products increased in as compared to  while volumes of melted products were higher as a result of increased demand across all market segments  especially commercial aerospace 
large commercial aircraft deliveries increased from in to in  and deliveries are expected to be aircraft 
as previously discussed  a substantial portion of timet s business is tied to the commercial aerospace industry  and sales of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year 
therefore  timet s sales in were significantly benefited from the increase in production of large commercial aircraft scheduled for delivery in timet s operating results comparisons were favorably impacted in by improved plant operating rates  which increased from in to in  and higher gross margin from the sale of titanium scrap which timet can not economically recycle and other non mill products 
in addition  timet s operating results comparisons were negatively impacted by higher costs for raw materials  energy and accruals for certain performance based employee incentive compensation and a million noncash impairment charge in the first quarter of related to certain abandoned manufacturing equipment of timet 
timet reported higher sales in as compared to  and operating income improved from a million loss in to million of income in  in part due to the net effects of a increase in sales volumes of mill products  a increase in sales volumes of melted products ingot and slab and an increase in melted product average selling prices 
timet s mill product average selling prices were positively affected by the weakening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling and the euro  and were negatively impacted by changes in customer and product mix 
the increase in sales volumes for mill and melted products is principally the result of greater market demands and share gains 
as discussed above  a substantial portion of timet s business is derived from the commercial aerospace industry  and sales of titanium to that market sector generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year 
therefore  timet s sales benefited significantly from the increase in production of large commercial aircraft scheduled for delivery in timet s operating results in includes income in the first quarter of million related to a change in timet s vacation policy 
timet s operating results comparisons were also favorably impacted by improved plant operating rates  which increased from in to in  and timet s continued cost management efforts 
timet s operating results comparisons were negatively impacted by higher costs for raw materials scrap and alloys and energy 
timet s operating results in include i a million charge related to the termination of timet s purchase and sale agreement with wyman gordon and ii a million reduction in its accrual for a previously reported product liability matter 
timet s operating results in were also negatively affected by higher accruals for employee incentive compensation 
during the second quarter of  timet recognized a million pre tax gain million  or 
per diluted share  net of income taxes and minority interest to valhi related to the sale of certain real property adjacent to timet s facility in nevada 
in addition  timet periodically reviews its deferred income tax assets to determine if future realization is more likely than not 
during the first quarter of  due to a change in estimate of timet s ability to utilize the benefits of its net operating loss carryforwards  other tax attributes and deductible temporary differences in the us and the us  timet determined that its net deferred income tax assets in such jurisdictions now met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
accordingly  timet s income tax benefit in includes a million benefit million  or 
per diluted share  net of minority interest to valhi related to reversal of the valuation allowances attributable to such deferred income tax assets 
timet s provision for income taxes in includes million of deferred income taxes resulting from the elimination of its minimum pension liability equity adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income related to its us defined benefit pension plan 
in accordance with gaap  timet did not recognize a deferred income tax benefit related to a portion of the minimum pension equity adjustment previously recognized  as timet had also recognized a deferred income tax asset valuation related to its us net operating loss carryforward and other us net deductible temporary differences during a portion of the periods in which the minimum pension equity adjustment had previously been recognized 
in accordance with gaap  a portion of such valuation allowance recognized million was recognized through timet s pension liability component of other comprehensive income 
as discussed above  during timet concluded recognition of such deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was no longer required  and in accordance with gaap the reversal of all of such valuation allowance was recognized through the provision for income taxes included in the determination of net income  including the million portion of the valuation allowance which was previously recognized through other comprehensive income 
as of december   timet was no longer required to recognize a minimum pension liability related to its us plan  and timet reversed the minimum pension liability previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
after the reversal of such minimum pension liability  which in accordance with gaap was recognized on a net of tax basis  the million amount remained in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the us minimum pension liability  which in accordance with gaap is required to be recognized in the provision for income taxes during the period in which the minimum pension liability is no longer required to be recognized 
in august  timet completed an exchange offer in which approximately million shares of the outstanding convertible preferred debt securities issued by timet capital trust i a wholly owned subsidiary of timet were exchanged for an aggregate of million shares of a newly created series a preferred stock of timet at the exchange rate of one share of series a preferred stock for each convertible preferred debt security 
timet recognized a non cash pre tax gain of million related to such exchange 
the exchange of the convertible preferred debt securities for a new issue of timet preferred stock resulted in timet reporting lower interest expense subsequent to the august exchange  although the effect on timet s income attributable to common stock of lower interest expense will be substantially offset by dividends accruing on the preferred stock 
effective july   timet entered into a new long term agreement with boeing for the purchase and sale of titanium products 
the new agreement expires on december  and provides for  among other things  i mutual annual purchase and supply commitments by both parties  ii continuation of the existing buffer inventory program currently in place for boeing and iii certain improved product pricing  including certain adjustments for raw material cost fluctuations 
the new agreement also replaces  beginning in  the take or pay provisions of the previous agreement discussed below with an annual makeup payment early in the following year in the event boeing purchases less than its annual volume commitment in any year 
under timet s prior long term agreement with boeing  boeing advanced timet million annually for each of  and at the beginning of the year  and boeing forfeited a proportionate part of the such annual advance  or effectively per pound  to the extent that its orders for delivery for such calendar year were less than million pounds 
timet was only required  however  to deliver up to million pounds per quarter 
based on timet s actual deliveries to boeing of approximately million pounds during  million pounds during and million pounds during  timet recognized income of million in  million in and million in related to the take or pay provisions of the contract 
these earnings related to the take or pay provisions distort timet s operating income percentages as there is no corresponding amount reported in timet s sales 
timet s effective income tax rate in and varies from the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily because timet concluded it was not appropriate to recognize an income tax benefit related to its us and us losses under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition  timet s provision for income taxes in includes a million income tax benefit million  or 
per diluted share  net of income taxes related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward  the benefit of which had not been previously recognized by timet 
timet continues to see the availability of certain raw materials tighten  and  consequently  the prices for such raw materials increase 
timet currently expects that the shortage in certain raw materials is likely to continue throughout  which could limit timet s ability to produce enough titanium products to fully meet customer demand 
in addition  timet has certain long term customer agreements that will somewhat limit its ability to pass on all of its increased raw material costs 
however  timet expects that the impact of higher average selling prices for melted and mill products in will more than offset such increased raw material costs 
timet currently expects its net sales revenue will increase by to from  to between billion and billion 
mill product sales volumes  which were  metric tons in  are expected to range from  and  metric tons in  an increase of to 
melted product sales volumes  which were  metric tons in  are expected to remain relatively unchanged in melted product average selling prices in are expected to increase by to  with mill product prices expected to increase by to 
timet s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor costs and energy costs 
raw material costs  which include sponge  scrap and alloys  represent the largest portion of its cost structure  and as previously discussed  continued cost increases are expected during scrap and certain alloy prices have continued their upward rise  and increased energy costs also continue to have a negative impact on gross margin 
timet currently expects production volumes to continue to increase in  with overall capacity utilization expected to approximate to in as compared to in 
however  practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
under the terms of timet s new long term agreement with boeing  timet does not currently expect boeing will incur a makeup payment for as timet expects boeing will purchase at least its minimum specified volumes from timet 
timet expects its operating income will increase to over  to between million and million 
general corporate and other items general corporate interest and dividend income 
general corporate interest and dividend income in was higher as compared to the same periods of due primarily to a higher level of distributions received from the amalgamated sugar company llc llc 
a significant portion of the company s general corporate interest and dividend income relates to distributions received from the amalgamated sugar company llc and interest income on the company s million loan to snake river sugar company 
dividend income for distributions from the llc aggregated million in  million in and million in  while interest income on the company s loan to snake river aggregated million in each of and and million in see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the company and snake river sugar company amended the company agreement of the llc pursuant to which  among other things  the llc is required to make higher minimum levels of distributions to its members including the company as compared to levels required under the prior company agreement  which would result in the company receiving annual distributions from the llc in aggregate amounts approximately million 
in addition  assuming certain specified conditions are met which conditions the company met during the fourth quarter of and which are currently expected to be met during  the llc would be required to distribute  in addition to the distributions noted in the preceding sentence  additional amounts that would result in the company receiving at least an additional million during the month period ending december  with approximately million received in the fourth quarter of and the remaining million expected to be paid during 
also in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million charge to earnings related to the accrued interest on the company s loan to snake river that was forgiven 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
general corporate interest and dividend income in was comparable to aggregate general corporate interest and dividend income in is currently expected to be lower than due primarily to lower expected distributions from the llc  as discussed above 
insurance recoveries 
nl has reached an agreement with a former insurance carrier in which such carrier would reimburse nl for a portion of its past and future lead pigment litigation defense costs  although the amount that nl will ultimately recover from such carrier with respect to such defense costs incurred by nl is not yet determinable 
in addition  during  nl recognized million of recoveries from certain insolvent former insurance carriers relating to settlement of excess insurance claims that were paid to nl 
insurance recoveries of  in   in and  in relate to nl s settlements with certain of its former insurance carriers 
these settlements  as well as similar prior settlements nl reached prior to  resolved court proceedings in which nl had sought reimbursement from the carriers for legal defense costs and indemnity coverage for certain of its environmental remediation expenditures 
no further material settlements relating to litigation concerning environmental remediation coverages are expected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while nl continues to seek additional insurance recoveries  there can be no assurance that nl will be successful in obtaining reimbursement for either defense costs or indemnity 
nl has not considered any potential insurance recoveries in determining related accruals for lead pigment litigation matters 
any such additional insurance recoveries would be recognized when their receipt is deemed probable and the amount is determinable

general corporate expenses 
net general corporate expenses in were million higher than  due primarily to higher legal expenses of nl 
net general corporate expenses in were million lower than due primarily to lower environmental remediation and legal expenses of nl 
such environmental and legal expenses are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
net general corporate expenses in calendar are currently expected to be higher as compared to calendar  in part due to higher expected litigation and related expenses of nl 
however  obligations for environmental remediation obligations are difficult to assess and estimate  and no assurance can be given that actual costs for environmental remediation will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred in the future with respect to sites for which no estimate of liability can presently be made

interest expense 
the company has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in the euro  including kii s euro denominated senior secured notes euro million outstanding at december  
accordingly  the reported amount of interest expense will vary depending on relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest expense in was higher than due primarily to the interest expense associated with the additional euro million principal amount of senior secured notes issued in november in addition  the increase in interest expense was due to relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased the us dollar equivalent of interest expense on the euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes outstanding during all of both and by approximately million 
interest expense in was higher than due primarily to relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased the us dollar equivalent of interest expense on the euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes outstanding during all of both and by approximately million 
assuming interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not increase significantly from current levels  interest expense in is expected to be approximate at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally kii s senior secured notes and valhi s loans from snake river sugar company  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging million with a weighted average interest rate of  million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was  
relative changes in the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings at december   and are due primarily to relative differences in the mix of such borrowings  with higher relative outstanding borrowings at december  as compared to december  under the kii european revolver  for which the interest rate is generally higher than the interest rate on any outstanding us variable borrowings 
as noted above  kii has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in currencies other than the us dollar

provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s income tax expense in includes the net non cash effects of i the aggregate favorable effects of recent developments with respect to certain non us income tax audits of kronos  principally in belgium and canada  of million million  or 
per diluted share  net of minority interest  ii the favorable effect of recent developments with respect to certain income tax items of nl of million million  or 
per diluted share  net of minority interest  iii the unfavorable effect with respect to the loss of certain income tax attributes of kronos in germany of million million  or 
per diluted share  net of minority interest and iv the unfavorable effect with respect to a change in compx s permanent reinvestment conclusion regarding certain of its non us subsidiaries of million million  or 
per diluted share  net of minority interest 
at december   kronos had the equivalent of million and million of income tax loss carryforwards for german corporate and trade tax purposes  respectively  all of which have no expiration date 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  kronos had previously provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of these tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany because kronos did not believe they met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
during the first six months of  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of these german net operating loss carryforwards  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized 
at june   after considering all available evidence  kronos concluded that these german tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences now met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
under applicable gaap related to accounting for income taxes at interim periods  a change in estimate at an interim period resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance is segregated into two components  the portion related to the remaining interim periods of the current year and the portion related to all future years 
the portion of the valuation allowance reversal related to the former is recognized over the remaining interim periods of the current year  and the portion of the valuation allowance related to the latter is recognized at the time the change in estimate is made 
accordingly  as of june   kronos reversed million of the valuation allowance the portion related to future years  and kronos reversed the remaining million during the last six months of prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
also during  nl recognized a second quarter million income tax benefit related to income tax attributes of nl environmental management services  inc ems  a subsidiary of nl 
this income tax benefit resulted from a settlement agreement reached with the us irs concerning the irs previously reported examination of a certain restructuring transaction involving ems  and included i an million tax benefit related to a reduction in the amount of additional income taxes and interest which nl estimates it will be required to pay related to this matter as a result of the settlement agreement and ii a million tax benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to certain tax attributes of ems including a us net operating loss carryforward which nl now believes meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in january  the german federal government enacted new tax law amendments that limit the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards effective january  to of taxable income after the first euro million of taxable income 
the new law will have a significant effect on kronos cash tax payments in germany going forward  the extent of which will be dependent upon the level of taxable income earned in germany 
during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
in addition  kronos recognized a million income tax benefit related to the net refund of certain prior year german income taxes 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company commenced to recognize deferred income taxes with respect to the excess of the financial reporting carrying amount over the income tax basis of valhi s investment in kronos beginning in december following nl s pro data distribution of shares of kronos common stock to nl s shareholders  including valhi 
the aggregate amount of such deferred income taxes included in the company s provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in in addition  the company s provision for income taxes in  and includes an aggregate million  million and  respectively  for the current income tax effect related to nl s distribution of such shares of kronos common stock to nl s shareholders other than valhi during such periods

assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the projected benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans was comprised of million related to us plans and million related to us plans 
substantially  all of such projected benefit obligations attributable to non us plans related to plans maintained by kronos  and approximately  and of the projected benefit obligations attributable to us plans related to plans maintained by nl  kronos and medite corporation  a former business unit of valhi medite plan 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulation such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by the company to all of its defined benefit pension plans aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th for the kronos and nl plans and december st for the medite plan to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations attributable to plans maintained by kronos at december  related to kronos plans in germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the medite plan and nl s plans are all in the us the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  and expense december  and expense december  and in in expense in kronos and nl plans germany norway canada us medite plan the assumed long term rate return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   the fair value of plan assets for all defined benefit plans was comprised of million related to us plans and million related to non us plans 
all of such plan assets attributable to non us plans related to plans maintained by kronos  and approximately  and of the plan assets attributable to us plans related to plans maintained by nl and kronos and the medite plan  respectively 
approximately   and of the plan assets attributable to plans maintained by kronos at december  related to plans in germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the medite plan and nl s plans are all in the us the company uses several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differs from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o during  substantially all of the kronos  nl and medite plan assets in the us were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt through december   the average annual rate of return has been approximately including a return during 
at december   the asset mix of the cmrt was in us equity securities  in us fixed income securities  in international equity securities and in cash and other investments 
o in germany  the composition of kronos plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and to real estate 
o in norway  kronos currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers  to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately  to and  respectively 
the plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
o in canada  kronos currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and to other investments 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and periodically rebalances the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets used for purposes of determining net period pension cost for  and were as follows kronos and nl plans germany norway canada us medite plan the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels based upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because kronos maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as discussed above  assumed discount rates and rate of return on plan assets are re evaluated annually 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves or plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
under gaap  all of such actuarial gains and losses are not recognized in earnings currently  but instead are deferred and amortized into income in the future as part of net periodic defined benefit pension cost 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of the company s defined benefit pension plans generated a net actuarial loss of million 
this actuarial loss  principally related to kronos defined benefit pension plans  resulted primarily from the general overall reduction in the assumed discount rates as well as the unfavorable effect of using updated mortality tables which generally reflect individuals living longer than prior mortality tables used  partially offset by an actual return on plan assets in excess of the assumed return 
while actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income in future periods  as discussed above  gaap also requires that a minimum amount of accrued pension cost be recognized in a statement of financial position for any plans for which the accumulated benefit obligation is less than the fair value of plan assets 
to the extent gaap accounting would otherwise result in an accrued pension cost balance for such plans that was less than the excess of the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation over the value of the related plan assets  gaap then requires that such excess be recognized as a component of the consolidated accrued pension cost  with the offset to such additional accrued pension cost commonly referred to as an additional minimum liability recognized i first as an intangible asset up to specified amounts referred to as unrecognized net pension obligations in the company s balance sheet and then ii second as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at december   and primarily as a result of the aggregate million actuarial loss generated during as discussed above  the aggregate amount of the additional minimum liability required to be recognized by kronos increased by approximately million at december  as compared to december   resulting in the company recognized aggregate accrued pension cost current and noncurrent of million at december  as compared to million at december  based on the actuarial assumptions described above and kronos current expectations for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company currently expects aggregate defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company currently expects to be required to make approximately million of aggregate contributions to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as prepaid and accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if kronos and nl had lowered the assumed discount rates by basis points for all of their plans as of december   their aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and their aggregate defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if kronos and nl lowered the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets by basis points for all of their plans  their defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during similar assumed changes with respect to the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the medite plan would not be significant 
opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately  and of the company s aggregate accrued opeb costs relate to tremont  nl and kronos  respectively 
kronos provides such opeb benefits to retirees in the us and canada  and nl and tremont provide such opeb benefits to retirees in the us the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb expense of  in  million in and million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  million in and million in substantially all of the company s accrued opeb costs relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents  and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
as a result  the amount recognized for opeb expense for financial reporting purposes has been  and is expected to continue to be  significantly less than the amount of opeb benefit payments made each year 
accordingly  the amount of accrued opeb costs has been  and is expected to continue to  decline gradually 
the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
in certain cases  nl has the right to pass on to retirees all or a portion of any increases in health care costs 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from to in  declining to rates of between and in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and kronos current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rates by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in foreign operations kronos 
kronos has substantial operations located outside the united states principally europe and canada for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of kronos assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   kronos had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and british pound sterling 
compx 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally slide and or ergonomic product operations in canada and taiwan 
timet 
timet also has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally in the united kingdom  france and italy 
the united kingdom has not adopted the euro 
approximately of timet s european sales was denominated in the british pound or the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials for timet s european operations  principally titanium sponge and alloys  are denominated in us dollars while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the us dollar value of timet s foreign sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that can impact reported earnings 
liquidity and capital resources summary the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flows from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends including dividends paid to valhi by its subsidiaries 
in addition  from time to time the company will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness  iii make investments in marketable and other securities including the acquisition of securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliates of the company or iv fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
also  the company will from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to i repay existing indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
at december   the company s third party indebtedness was substantially comprised of i valhi s million of loans from snake river sugar company due in  ii kii s euro denominated senior secured notes equivalent of million principal amount outstanding due in and iii kronos us revolving bank credit facility million outstanding due in accordingly  since none of such indebtedness comes due in  the company does not currently expect that a significant amount of its cash flows from operating activities generated during will be required to be used to repay indebtedness during based upon the company s expectations for the industries in which its subsidiaries and affiliates operate  and the anticipated demands on the company s cash resources as discussed herein including debt refinancing expectations  the company expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its short term obligations defined as the twelve month period ending december  and its long term obligations defined as the five year period ending december   the time period for which the company generally does long term budgeting  including operations  capital expenditures  debt service current dividend policy and repurchases of its common stock 
to the extent that actual developments differ from the company s expectations  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
however  certain items included in the determination of net income are non cash  and therefore such items have no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
non cash items included in the determination of net income include depreciation and amortization expense  non cash interest expense  deferred income taxes  asset impairment charges and unrealized securities transactions gains and losses 
non cash interest expense relates principally to kronos and consists of amortization of original issue discount or premium on certain indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs 
certain other items included in the determination of net income may have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash flows from operating activities will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  equity in earnings of affiliates will generally differ from the amount of distributions received from such affiliates  and equity in losses of affiliates does not necessarily result in current cash outlays paid to such affiliates 
the amount of periodic defined benefit pension plan expense and periodic opeb expense depends upon a number of factors  including certain actuarial assumptions  and changes in such actuarial assumptions will result in a change in the reported expense 
in addition  the amount of such periodic expense generally differs from the outflows of cash required to be currently paid for such benefits 
also  proceeds from the disposal of marketable securities classified as trading securities are reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities  and such proceeds will generally differ from the amount of the related gain or loss on disposal 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have no impact on cash flows from operating activities  but such items do impact cash flows from investing activities although their impact on such cash flows differs from their impact on net income 
for example  realized gains and losses from the disposal of available for sale marketable securities and long lived assets are included in the determination of net income  although the proceeds from any such disposal are shown as part of cash flows from investing activities 
changes in product pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  can significantly affect the liquidity of the company 
relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flows from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period from when the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
relative changes in accounts receivable are affected by  among other things  the timing of sales and the collection of the resulting receivable 
relative changes in inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities are affected by  among other things  the timing of raw material purchases and the payment for such purchases and the relative difference between production volumes and sales volumes 
relative changes in accrued environmental costs are affected by  among other things  the period in which the environmental accrual is recognized and the period in which the remediation expenditure is actually made 
cash flows from operating activities decreased from million in to million in this million net decrease is due primarily to the net effects of i lower net income of million  ii higher net securities transaction gains of million  iii a higher provision for deferred income taxes of million  iv lower minority interest of million  v higher equity in earnings of timet of million  vi lower net cash distributions from the tio manufacturing joint venture of million  vii higher net cash paid for income taxes of million  due in large part to million of aggregate income tax refunds received by kronos in and a million payment by nl in to settle a previously reported income tax audit  viii million higher use of cash related to relative changes in working capital items principally accounts receivable  inventories  payables and accruals and accounts with affiliates  and ix higher net cash generated from relative changes in other noncurrent assets and liabilities of million 
cash flows provided from operating activities increased from million in to million in this million increase was due primarily to the net effect of i higher net income of million  ii goodwill impairment in of million  iii lower net gains from the disposal of property and equipment of million  iv a larger deferred income tax benefit of million  v higher depreciation and amortization expense of million  vi higher distributions from kronos tio manufacturing joint venture of million  vii a million improvement in equity in earnings losses of timet  viii higher minority interest of million  ix a higher use of cash related to relative changes in working capital items principally accounts receivable  inventories  payables and accruals and accounts with affiliates of million  x higher net cash used from relative changes in other noncurrent assets and liabilities of million and xi higher cash received for income taxes of million 
relative changes in working capital assets and liabilities can have a significant effect on cash flows from operating activities 
kronos average days sales outstanding dso decreased from days at december  to days at december   due to the timing of collection 
at december   kronos average number of days in inventory dii increased to days from days at december  due to the effects of higher production volumes and lower sales volumes 
compx s average dso related to its continuing operations increased from days at december  to days at december  due to timing of collection on the slightly higher accounts receivable balance at the end of compx s average dii related to its continuing operations was days at december  and days at december  the increase in compx s dii is primarily due to higher raw material prices  primarily steel 
valhi does not have complete access to the cash flows of its subsidiaries and affiliates  in part due to limitations contained in certain credit agreements as well as the fact that such subsidiaries and affiliates are not owned by valhi

see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of common stock 
provisions contained in certain of the company s credit agreements could result in the acceleration of the applicable indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of valhi s revolving bank credit facility could require valhi to either reduce outstanding borrowings or pledge additional collateral in the event the fair value of the existing pledged collateral falls below specified levels 
in addition  certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than the operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither valhi nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
chemicals kronos at december   kronos had cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of million  including restricted balances of million  and kronos had approximately million available for borrowing under its us  canadian and european credit facilities 
based upon kronos expectations for the tio industry  kronos expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its future obligations including operations  capital expenditures  debt service and current dividend policy 
to the extent that actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos liquidity could be adversely affected 
at december   kronos outstanding debt was comprised of million related to kii s senior secured notes  million outstanding under kronos us revolving credit facility and approximately million of other indebtedness 
kronos capital expenditures during the past three years aggregated million  including million million in for kronos ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs 
kronos estimated capital expenditures are million  including million in the area of environmental protection and compliance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain income tax examinations currently underway with respect to certain of kronos income tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions  and see note to the consolidated financial statements with respect to certain legal proceedings with respect to kronos 
kronos international s assets consist primarily of investments in its operating subsidiaries  and its ability to service its parent level obligations  including the senior secured notes  depends in large part upon the distribution of earnings of its subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligation  or otherwise 
none of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured notes  although kronos international has pledged of the common stock or other ownership interest of certain of its first tier operating subsidiaries as collateral of such senior secured notes 
kronos periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its dividend policy  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  kronos in the past has sought and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  kronos may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals or other industries  as well as the acquisition of interests in related entities 
in the event of any such transaction  kronos may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing kronos existing debt 
kronos has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amounts of kronos assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore kronos consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
nl industries parent at december   nl exclusive of compx had cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of million  including restricted balances of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain income tax examinations currently underway with respect to certain of nl s income tax returns  and see note to the consolidated financial statements and item  legal proceedings with respect to certain legal proceedings and environmental matters with respect to nl 
in addition to those legal proceedings described in note to the consolidated financial statements and item  various legislation and administrative regulations have  from time to time  been proposed that seek to i impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead based paint with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and ii effectively overturn court decisions in which nl and other pigment manufacturers have been successful 
examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage  and bills which would revive actions barred by the statute of limitations 
while no legislation or regulations have been enacted to date that are expected to have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  enactment of such legislation could have such an effect 
prior to december  kronos was a wholly owned subsidiary of nl 
in december  and in conjunction with a recapitalization of kronos  nl completed the distribution of approximately of kronos common stock to nl shareholders including valhi and tremont llc in the form of a pro rata dividend 
shareholders of nl received one share of kronos common stock for every two shares of nl held 
during and the first quarter of  nl paid an aggregate of five quarterly dividends in the form of shares of kronos common stock  in which an aggregate of approximately million shares of kronos common stock of kronos outstanding shares were distributed to nl shareholders including valhi and tremont in the form of pro rata dividends 
valhi and tremont which until january owned part of the company s interest in nl received an aggregate of approximately million shares of kronos with respect to these distributions 
in january  tremont distributed to valhi its ownership interest in kronos 
nl s  and distributions of shares of common stock of kronos are taxable to nl  and nl is required to recognize a taxable gain equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares of kronos common stock distributed on the various dates of distribution and nl s adjusted tax basis in such stock at such dates of distribution 
the amount of such tax liability related to the shares of kronos distributed to nl shareholders other than valhi and tremont was approximately million in  million in and  in  and such amounts are recognized as a component of the company s consolidated provision for income taxes in such periods 
other than the company s recognition of such nl tax liabilities  the completion of the december and and quarterly distributions of kronos had no other impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of nl s separate tax liability with respect to the shares of kronos distributed to valhi and tremont  while recognized by nl at its separate company level  is not recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements because the separate tax liability is eliminated at the valhi level due to valhi  tremont and nl all being members of the contran tax group 
with respect to such shares of kronos distributed to valhi and tremont  effective december   valhi and nl amended the terms of their tax sharing agreement to not require nl to pay up to valhi the separate tax liability generated from the distribution of such kronos shares to valhi and tremont 
on november  valhi and nl agreed to further amend the terms of their tax sharing agreement to provide that nl would now be required to pay up to valhi the separate tax liability generated from the distribution of shares of kronos common stock to valhi and tremont  including the tax related to such shares distributed to valhi and tremont in december and the tax related to the shares distributed to valhi and tremont during all of in determining to so amend the terms of the tax sharing agreement  nl and valhi considered  among other things  the changed expectation for the generation of taxable income at the nl level resulting from the inclusion of compx in nl s consolidated taxable income effective in the fourth quarter of  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
valhi and nl further agreed that in lieu of a cash income tax payment  such separate tax liability could be paid by nl to valhi in the form of shares of kronos common stock held by nl 
such tax liability related to the shares of kronos distributed to valhi and tremont in december and  including the tax liability resulting from the use of kronos common stock to settle such liability  aggregated approximately million 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of nl transferred approximately million shares of kronos common stock to valhi in satisfaction of such separate tax liability and the tax liability generated from the use of such kronos shares to settle such tax liability 
in agreeing to settle such tax liability with such million shares of kronos common stock  the kronos shares were valued at an agreed upon price of per share 
kronos average closing market prices during the months of november and december were and  respectively 
nl also considered the fact that the shares of kronos held by non affiliates are very thinly traded  and consequently an average price over a period of days mitigates the effect of the thinly traded nature of kronos common stock 
the transfer of such million shares of kronos common stock  accounted for under gaap as a transfer of net assets among entities under common control at carryover basis  had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  and as noted above such tax liability is not recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements because it is eliminated at the valhi level due to valhi  tremont and nl all being members of valhi s tax group on a separate company basis and of the contran tax group 
such tax liability related to the shares of kronos distributed to valhi in the first quarter of aggregated million  and such tax liability was paid by nl to valhi in cash 
this aggregate million tax liability has not been paid by valhi to contran  nor has contran paid such tax liability to the applicable tax authority 
such income tax liability would become payable by valhi to contran  and by contran to the applicable tax authority  when the shares of kronos transferred or distributed by nl to valhi and tremont are sold or otherwise transferred outside the contran tax group or in the event of certain restructuring transactions involving nl and valhi 
however  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does recognize deferred income taxes with respect to its investment in kronos  and in accordance with gaap the amount of such deferred income taxes recognized by valhi million at december  is limited to this million tax liability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
following the second of such quarterly dividends of nl  nl no longer owned a majority of kronos outstanding common stock  and accordingly nl ceased to consolidate kronos as of july  however  the company continues to consolidate kronos since the company continues to own a majority of kronos  either directly or indirectly through nl 
prior to september   the company s ownership of compx was owned by valhi and valcor a wholly owned subsidiary of valhi 
on september   nl completed the acquisition of the compx shares previously held by valhi and valcor at a purchase price of per share  or an aggregate of approximately million 
the purchase price was paid by nl s transfer to valhi and valcor of million of nl s million long term note receivable from kronos which long term note and related interest income and interest expense were eliminated in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
nl s acquisition was accounted for under gaap as a transfer of net assets among entities under common control  and such transaction had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
after such acquisition  nl retained a million note receivable from kronos  which note receivable kronos prepaid in november using funds from kii s november issuance of euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes 
nl periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its dividend policy  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows

such shares were purchased under the stock repurchase program 
valhi s independent directors approved such purchase 
the company has also purchased during the second  third and fourth quarters of an additional million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program in market transactions for an aggregate of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as noted above  in september nl completed the acquisition of the shares of compx common stock previously held by valhi and valcor 
the purchase price for these shares was paid by nl s transfer to valhi and valcor of an aggregate million of nl s note receivable from kronos million to valcor and million to valhi 
in october  valcor distributed to valhi its million note receivable from kronos  and subsequently in the fourth quarter of kronos prepaid the million note payable to valhi using cash on hand and funds from kii s november issuance of euro million principal amount of its senior secured notes 
valhi used million of the proceeds from the repayment of its note receivable from kronos to repay the outstanding balance under its revolving bank credit facility 
the remainder of such funds were available for valhi s general corporate purposes 
the terms of the amalgamated sugar company llc company agreement provide for annual base level of cash dividend distributions sometimes referred to as distributable cash by the llc of million  from which the company is entitled to a preferential share 
distributions from the llc are dependent  in part  upon the operations of the llc 
the company records dividend distributions from the llc as income upon receipt  which occurs in the same month in which they are declared by the llc 
to the extent the llc s distributable cash is below this base level in any given year  the company is entitled to an additional preferential share of any future annual llc distributable cash in excess of the base level until such shortfall is recovered 
based on the llc s current projections for  valhi currently expects that distributions received from the llc in will exceed its debt service requirements under its million loans from snake river sugar company 
certain covenants contained in snake river s third party senior debt allowed snake river in certain circumstances to pay periodic installments of debt service payments principal and interest under valhi s million loan to snake river prior to its scheduled maturity in  and such loan was subordinated to snake river s third party senior debt 
during the third quarter of  snake river prepaid such senior third party senior debt  and snake river subsequently made an aggregate of million of debt service payments to valhi during the quarter 
at september   the accrued and unpaid interest on the million loan to snake river aggregated million and was classified as a noncurrent asset 
the company believed it would ultimately realize both the million principal amount and the accrued and unpaid interest  whether through cash generated from the future operations of snake river and the llc or otherwise including any liquidation of snake river or the llc 
following the complete repayment of snake river s third party senior debt  snake river was required  under the terms of the company s loan to snake river  to use all of its available cash resources to make debt service payments to valhi estimated to be approximately million annually  including the funds that snake river previously was using to fund debt service on its third party senior debt 
in october  when valhi agreed to forgive approximately million of accrued and unpaid interest in return for snake river prepaying an aggregate of million under its loan from valhi  valhi considered  among other things  the present value of the future repayment of its loan to snake river under the present terms  the income tax benefit relating to forgiveness of the accrued interest and valhi s various alternate reinvestment opportunities with respect to such prepayment and the returns thereon 
consequently  while valhi continued to believe it would ultimately fully collect all amounts due under the terms of its loan to snake river  valhi was willing to accept a discount under certain conditions principally  snake river s million prepayment 
in october  snake river completed a new senior loan facility that generated funds sufficient to make the million prepayment to valhi  and valhi accordingly forgave the remaining accrued and unpaid interest 
see note and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company may  at its option  require the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in  and the llc has the right to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in the redemption price is generally million plus the amount of certain undistributed income allocable to the company  if any 
in the event the company requires the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc  snake river has the right to accelerate the maturity of and call valhi s million loans from snake river 
redemption of the company s interest in the llc would result in the company reporting income related to the disposition of its llc interest for income tax purposes  although the company would not be expected to report a gain in earnings for financial reporting purposes at the time its llc interest was redeemed as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  because of snake river s ability to call its million loans to valhi upon redemption of the company s interest in the llc  the net cash proceeds after repayment of the debt generated by redemption of the company s interest in the llc could be less than the income taxes that would become payable as a result of the disposition

non gaap financial measures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results of operations as determined by gaap  the company has disclosed certain non gaap information which the company believes provides useful information to investors o the company discloses percentage changes in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies  which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation 
the company believes disclosure of such percentage changes allows investors to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
the company has also periodically entered into currency forward contracts to either manage a nominal portion of foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar risk associated with future sales  or to hedge specific foreign currency commitments 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments to which the company is a party at december  and interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness and certain interest bearing notes receivable 
at december   the company s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for such foreign currency denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using exchange rates of us dollars per euro 
amount carrying fair interest maturity indebtedness value value rate date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated kii senior secured notes valhi loans from snake river other various variable rate indebtedness kronos us revolver denominated in us dollars  except as otherwise indicated 
excludes capital lease obligations 
at december   fixed rate indebtedness aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of  variable rate indebtedness at such date aggregated million  which approximates fair value  with a weighted average interest rate of 
such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in the euro of the total or the us dollars 
at december   all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars or the euro  and the outstanding variable rate borrowings were denominated in the euro 
the company had an million loan to snake river sugar company at december  such loan bore interest at a fixed interest rate of  and the estimated fair value of such loan at such date was million 
the potential decrease in the fair value of such loan resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would be approximately million at december  such loan was prepaid during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the british pound sterling 
as described above  at december   kronos had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million 
certain of the kronos sales generated by its non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
kronos periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
kronos has not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor does kronos currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
derivatives used to hedge forecasted transactions and specific cash flows associated with foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges 
consequently  the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings 
contracts that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to market at each balance sheet date with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently as part of net currency transactions 
during and  kronos has not used hedge accounting for any of its contracts 
to manage such exchange rate risk  at december   kronos held a series of short term currency forward contracts  which mature through march  to exchange an aggregate of us million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn 
per us dollar 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contracts at december  was not material 
kronos held no such contracts at december   and held no other significant derivative contracts at december  or certain of the compx s sales generated by its non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
compx periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
compx has not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor does compx currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
derivatives used to hedge forecasted transactions and specific cash flows associated with foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges 
consequently  the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings 
contracts that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to market at each balance sheet date with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently as part of net currency transactions

per us dollar at december  at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such forward exchange contracts at december  and is not material 
marketable equity and debt security prices 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such debt and equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million at december  and million at december  other 
the company believes there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous comparable shifts along the yield curve 
also  certain of the company s marketable securities are exchangeable for certain of the company s debt instruments  and a decrease in the fair value of such securities would likely be mitigated by a decrease in the fair value of the related indebtedness 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
