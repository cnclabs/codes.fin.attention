non gaap financial measure return on investment roi is an important internal measure for us because it is a key component of our evaluation of overall performance and the performance of our business segments 
studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between shareholder value and roi and that shareholder value is created when roi exceeds the cost of capital 
roi allows us to evaluate our performance on a consistent basis as the amount we earn relative to the amount invested in our business segments 
a significant portion of senior management s compensation is based on achieving roi targets 
in evaluating overall performance  we define roi as operating income  adjusted for significant unusual items  divided by parent company total assets  less certain assets and certain current liabilities 
in evaluating segment performance  we define roi as segment operating income divided by segment assets less segment current liabilities 
we do not believe there is a comparable gaap financial measure to our definition of roi 
the reconciliation of our roi calculation to amounts reported under gaap is included in a later section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
despite its importance to us  roi is a non gaap financial measure that has no standardized definition and as a result may not be comparable with other companies measures using the same or similar terms 
also there may be limits in the usefulness of roi to investors 
as a result  we encourage you to read our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements and note a to the parent company and financial services summarized financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results  and they are difficult for us to apply 
within the parent company  they include asset impairments and pension accounting  and within financial services  they include the allowance for loan losses and  through  mortgage servicing rights 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that we have to make currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  be different from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and 
table of contents judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have discussed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
measuring assets for impairment requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in our intentions  market conditions or operating performance could require us to revise the impairment charges we previously provided 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  currently percent  consideration is given to both historical returns and our estimate of returns over the next quarter century 
the actual rate of return on plan assets for the last ten years was percent 
another important consideration is the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations  currently percent 
differences between actual and expected rates of return and changes in the discount rate will affect future pension expense and funded status 
for example  a basis point change in the estimated expected rate of return would affect annual pension expense by million  and a basis point change in the discount rate would affect the funded status by million and annual pension expense by million 
allowances for loan losses are based on historical experiences and evaluations of future cash flows and collateral values and are subject to regulatory scrutiny 
changes in general economic conditions or loan specific circumstances will inevitably change those evaluations 
as a result of the sale of our third party mortgage servicing portfolio  accounting for mortgage servicing rights is no longer considered a critical accounting estimate 
new accounting pronouncements and change in method of accounting for certain inventories in the last three years  we adopted a number of new accounting pronouncements  and in  we changed our method of accounting for our corrugated packaging inventories and retrospectively applied the new method to prior year financial statements 
in addition there are three new accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in  none of which we expect to have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
please read note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
results of operations for the years  and summary our mission is to be the best by consistently exceeding customer expectations  maximizing asset utilization  lowering operating costs and improving efficiency 
we are a market driven  customer focused company 
our three key strategies are focusing on corrugated packaging from an integrated platform  which eliminates mill downtime and lowers costs through improved asset utilization  maximizing the value of our timberland through accelerated fiber growth that is aligned with well located converting operations and developing significant real estate opportunities on high value land  and realizing earnings and cash flow from financial services  which is a low cost  low risk provider of financial services 
actions we took in to implement our key strategies included we closed four corrugated packaging converting facilities and sold our pembroke  canada mdf facility to reduce costs and improve asset utilization 
these actions affected over employees 
we modified and enhanced two of our linerboard mills to increase mill reliability and reduce reliance on natural gas as an energy source 
we further repositioned our mortgage origination activities 
these actions affected over employees  and along with the mortgage repositioning efforts in  will further reduce costs and exposure to changing market conditions 
our future mortgage origination efforts will focus on direct mortgage lending to consumers through our banking centers  and we will continue to restructure our mortgage origination capabilities 

table of contents we announced that in we intend to classify as a fourth business segment our real estate operations that are currently included within our forest products and financial services segments 
this action will increase the visibility and transparency of our real estate operations 
a summary of our consolidated results follows for the year in millions  except per share consolidated revenues income from continuing operations income from continuing operations per diluted share roi significant items affecting income from continuing operations included in  we continued to see the benefits in our manufacturing operations of our initiatives to lower costs  improve asset utilization  and increase operating efficiencies and the benefits in our financial services operations from repositioning our mortgage origination and servicing activities 
costs  principally energy  freight and chemicals  however  continued to escalate for our manufacturing operations 
the increased costs offset some of the benefits from our initiatives in our manufacturing operations and lower health care costs attributable to the implementation of a new health plan design 
actions taken to lower costs  improve asset utilization  and increase operating efficiencies resulted in charges and expenses of million  principally related to the closure of four corrugated packaging converting facilities  the further repositioning of our mortgage origination activities and the sale of our pembroke  canada mdf facility 
as a result of the sale of the mdf facility  we recognized a one time tax benefit of million 
during  hurricanes katrina and rita forced us to curtail operations at seven of our converting and production facilities for varying periods  which we estimate adversely affected segment operating income by about million due to production downtime and start up expenses 
in addition  during  we recognized hurricane related losses and other unusual expenses of million 
the hurricane costs principally related to impairment of our texas and louisiana forests  facility damage  and employee and community assistance and other unusual expenses principally related to antitrust litigation and the early repayment of debt 
in  we began to see the benefits in our manufacturing operations of our initiatives to lower costs and improve asset utilization and operating efficiencies 
in addition  market demand strengthened  resulting in higher prices for most of our forest products  and prices for corrugated packaging began to improve in the second quarter of the year 
our financial services operations benefited from improved asset quality  which resulted in a recovery of previously recorded provisions for credit losses 
this was partially offset by declining mortgage origination activities 
actions taken to lower costs and improve asset utilization and operating efficiencies resulted in charges and expenses of million  principally related to the converting and production facility closures and the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities and sale of our third party mortgage servicing portfolio 
we also recognized a one time tax benefit of million resulting from the settlement of prior years tax examinations 
in  weak industry box demand and lower prices  continued excess capacity in most of our forest products  and higher energy and pension costs negatively affected our manufacturing revenues and earnings 
the negative effect was partially offset by improvements in financial services earnings 
actions taken to lower costs and improve asset utilization and operating efficiencies resulted in charges and expenses of million principally related to the sale or closure of under performing assets and the consolidation of administrative functions 
we also recognized a one time tax benefit of million resulting from the resolution and settlement of prior years tax examinations 
business segments we currently manage our operations through three business segments corrugated packaging  forest products  and financial services 

table of contents our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates  new housing starts  home repair and remodeling activities  loan collateral values particularly real estate  and the strength of the us dollar 
given the commodity nature of our manufactured products  we have little control over market pricing or market demand 
as previously announced  beginning first quarter  we will classify into a fourth business segment our real estate operations 
as a result  we anticipate transferring into the new real estate segment about million in real estate assets currently included in our financial services segment and about million of high value timberlands and other assets currently included in our forest products segment 
corrugated packaging we manufacture linerboard and corrugating medium that we convert into corrugated packaging and sell in the open market 
our corrugated packaging segment revenues are principally derived from the sale of corrugated packaging products and  to a lesser degree  from the sale of linerboard in the domestic and export markets 
a summary of our corrugated packaging results follows for the year dollars in millions revenues costs and expenses segment operating income segment roi hurricanes katrina and rita adversely affected segment operating results by about million principally related to mill production downtime and start up expenses at our bogalusa  louisiana and orange  texas linerboard mills 
corrugated packaging pricing  which includes freight and is net of discounts  increased in compared with  reflecting price increases implemented in the second half of in second quarter  corrugated packaging prices declined reflecting lower industry volumes 
however  in fourth quarter  corrugated packaging prices began to improve as a result of a linerboard price increases driven by capacity closures  stronger industry volumes and lower inventories 
in first quarter  we began to implement two corrugated packaging price increases 
our corrugated packaging shipments increased due to market share growth 
linerboard sales and shipments to third parties were down because more of our production was used in our converting facilities  which is consistent with our strategy to convert more of the linerboard we produce in our own converting facilities 
year over year increase decrease corrugated packaging average prices shipments  average week industry shipments  average week a linerboard average prices shipments  tons a source fibre box association about one percentage point of the and increase in corrugated packaging shipments is attributable to growth in our converting operations in mexico 
costs and expenses were up two percent in compared with and down two percent in compared with higher volumes and prices for most raw materials were partially offset by lower health care costs and cost reductions attributable to the closure of converting facilities  workforce reductions and 
table of contents increased mill reliability and efficiency  which resulted in lower maintenance costs and improved raw material yield and energy usage 
fluctuations in our significant cost and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions wood fiber recycled fiber energy  principally natural gas freight depreciation health care pension and postretirement the costs of our outside purchases of wood and recycled fiber  energy  and freight fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate in the changes in depreciation in and were principally due to the closure of converting facilities  and the change in was principally due to the facilities we acquired in information about our converting facilities and mills follows for the year number of converting facilities at year end mill capacity  in million tons mill production  in million tons percent mill production used internally percent of total fiber requirements sourced from recycled fiber corrugating medium purchases from our premier boxboard limited llc joint venture  in thousand tons as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  our mill production was adversely affected by about  tons 
forest products we own or lease two million acres of timberland in texas  louisiana  georgia  and alabama 
we grow timber  cut the timber and convert it into products 
we are creating the infrastructure and securing entitlements necessary for real estate development of our designated high value timberland in georgia  principally near atlanta 
we manufacture lumber  gypsum wallboard  particleboard  fiberboard and medium density fiberboard mdf 
our forest products segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of these products and  to a lesser degree  from sales of fiber and high value lands 
we also owned percent interests in a gypsum wallboard joint venture and an mdf joint venture 
in january  we acquired the remaining percent interest in the gypsum wallboard joint venture 
a summary of our forest products results follows for the year dollars in millions revenues costs and expenses segment operating income segment roi hurricane rita adversely affected segment operating results by about million principally related to downtime and start up expenses at four of our texas and louisiana lumber converting facilities 

table of contents pricing  which includes freight and is net of discounts  and shipments improved for most product lines due to the continued strength in the housing and repair and remodeling markets 
there is some uncertainty as to whether that strength will continue throughout year over year increase decrease lumber average prices shipments gypsum average prices shipments particleboard average prices shipments mdf average prices shipments comparisons of mdf and particleboard shipments are affected by the sale of our pembroke mdf facility in second quarter  the indefinite closure of our clarion mdf facility in third quarter and the subsequent sale of this facility in second quarter  and the indefinite closure of our mt 
jewett particleboard facility in second quarter segment operating income also includes for the year in millions our share of gypsum and mdf joint venture operating income hunting  mineral and recreational lease income gain on sale of about  acres of conservation timberland gain on sale of about  acres to an affiliated real estate joint venture the operating results from the gypsum and mdf joint ventures generally fluctuate in relation to the price and shipment changes noted above 
mineral income is generally derived from leases and royalty interests and fluctuates based on changes in the market prices for energy 
it is likely prices will continue to fluctuate in in  we sold about  acres of timber and timberland to a joint venture in which one of our financial services subsidiaries owns percent and an unrelated public company owns the other percent 
this acreage was sold pursuant to the terms of a long standing option agreement  which was about to expire 
the joint venture intends to hold the land for future development and sale 
we recognized about half of the million gain in income in and anticipate recognizing the remainder in the future as this land is sold 
at year end  our high value timberland consisted of about  acres located in georgia  principally near atlanta 
information regarding our high value land sales follows for the year dollars in millions high value land acres sold profit included in segment operating income costs and expenses were up five percent in compared with and up three percent in compared with higher volumes and higher prices for most raw materials offset lower health care costs and cost reductions attributable to the sale of our pembroke mdf facility in june and our clarion mdf facility in may 
table of contents fluctuations in our significant cost and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions wood fiber energy  principally natural gas freight chemicals depreciation health care pension and postretirement our goal is to increase use of wood fiber from our timberlands and reduce our reliance on outside purchases 
the cost of our outside purchases of fiber and energy  freight  and chemicals fluctuates based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate in information about our timber harvest and converting and manufacturing facilities follows for the year timber harvest  in million tons sawtimber pulpwood total number of converting and manufacturing facilities at year end average operating rates for all product lines excluding sold or closed facilities high low as a result of hurricane rita  our timber harvest was adversely affected by about  tons 
however  our average operating rates were not significantly affected 
in addition  we incurred about million in losses due to damage to our timberlands  which is not included in segment operating income 
it is unlikely that this damage will significantly affect the long term value of our timberlands 
financial services we own a savings bank  guaranty bank  which includes an insurance agency subsidiary  and engage in real estate development activities 
guaranty makes up the predominant amount of our financial services segment operating income  revenues  assets  and liabilities 
in general  we gather funds from depositors  borrow money  and invest the resulting cash in loans and securities 
we focus our investing and deposit gathering activities in products and geographic areas that promote a relatively stable source of earnings 
we attempt to minimize the potential effect of interest rate and credit quality cycles by investing principally in adjustable rate residential housing assets and maintaining an asset and liability profile that is relatively unaffected by movements in interest rates 
in general  we do not purchase or write derivative financial instrument contracts other than short term contracts to originate and to hedge mortgage loans that we intend to sell 
in our loan portfolio  we emphasize products with collateral and rate characteristics that we have significant experience managing and principally invest in assets with adjustable rates or that reprice in three to five years 
our deposit gathering activities are focused in two primary markets  texas and california  both of which offer substantial opportunity for cost effective growth 
limiting the markets and products in which we participate and avoiding complex financial instruments allows us to limit our infrastructure costs 
we  however  incur substantial costs to operate in a regulated environment and comply with the extensive laws and regulations to which guaranty is subject 

table of contents in late  we repositioned our mortgage origination activities  sold our third party mortgage servicing portfolio  and outsourced servicing of our single family portfolio loans 
in late  we further repositioned our mortgage origination activities by eliminating our wholesale mortgage origination network 
a summary of our financial services results follows for the year dollars in millions net interest income segment operating income segment roi although we were forced to close temporarily a few texas banking centers in as a result of hurricane rita  we did not sustain any significant facility damage 
these closures did not significantly affect our segment operating income 
net interest income and earning assets and deposits our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans including amortization of loan fees and deferred costs  securities and other interest earning assets  minus the interest we pay for deposits and borrowings and dividends we pay on preferred stock issued by subsidiaries 
our net interest margin is the average yield on our earning assets  calculated by dividing net interest income by our average earning assets for the period 
net interest margin is principally influenced by the relative rates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of noninterest bearing deposits  other liabilities and equity used to fund our assets 
information concerning our net interest margin follows for the year average yield average yield average yield balance rate balance rate balance rate dollars in millions earning assets interest bearing liabilities impact of noninterest bearing funds net interest margin in general  we position our balance sheet to minimize interest rate sensitivity thereby producing a relatively consistent net interest margin 
as we are currently positioned  if interest rates remain relatively stable  it is likely that our net interest margin will remain near its current level 
however  if interest rates change significantly  it is likely that our net interest margin will decline 
please read item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information 
as a result of our interest rate position  increases in market interest rates in did not significantly affect our net interest margin 
in  our net interest margin increased slightly  principally as a result of increased noninterest bearing deposits 
in  our net interest margin improved over  partially due to repricing of maturing higher rate certificates of deposit to lower market rates and partially due to an increase in lower rate transaction accounts along with a decrease in certificates of deposit 
in general  we pay lower rates on interest bearing transaction accounts than certificates of deposit 

table of contents the following table summarizes the composition of our earning assets and deposits at year end dollars in millions residential housing assets loans held for sale loans securities total residential housing assets other earning assets total earning assets residential housing assets as a percentage of earning assets noninterest bearing deposit accounts interest bearing deposit accounts certificates of deposit total deposits the increase in earning assets at year end was a result of mortgage backed security purchases we made in third and fourth quarter as a result of the repositioning of our mortgage wholesale network  we do not anticipate we will acquire new single family loans in in an amount equal to anticipated loan prepayments 
we will likely re invest proceeds from loan payments and prepayments into mortgage backed securities that have similar interest rate risk characteristics 
additionally  we anticipate increased funding on commercial real estate loan commitments in the decrease in loans held for sale at year end was a result of our mortgage origination activity repositioning in we expect further decreases in loans held for sale in as a result of the repositioning of our wholesale mortgage origination network 
a portion of our loans consists of adjustable rate mortgages that have various monthly payment options option arms 
these loans generally include the ability to select from fully amortizing payments  interest only payments and payments less than the interest accrual rate  which can result in negative amortization increasing the principal amount of the loan 
negative amortization is subject to various limitations  typically including a percent maximum principal balance as a percent of original principal balance  which limits the maximum loan to value ratio ltv that can be reached 
we underwrite borrowers on option arms at fully amortizing payment amounts  and the maximum principal balance limitation restricts negative amortization to percent of ltv 
at year end  loans held for sale and loans included billion of option arms 
in  we recognized million in interest income on billion in loans from borrowers that elected negative amortization payment options 
negative amortization interest recognized in and was not significant 
additionally  the mortgage backed securities we purchased in and a portion of the securities we have purchased in previous years have option arms as the underlying assets 
the outstanding principal balance of these securities at year end was billion 
of these securities  billion were issued by us government sponsored enterprises fnma  fhlmc and billion are senior tranches of private label offerings 
all of the securities bear aaa ratings from nationally recognized securities rating organizations 
in late  the federal banking regulators  including the office of thrift supervision ots  which supervises guaranty  published proposed guidance on lending standards that  if adopted  would affect lending and investing in option arms 
the proposed guidance outlines various underwriting and risk management activities appropriate for participating in non traditional lending activities 
we do not believe the proposed guidance  if adopted  would significantly affect our lending programs 

table of contents information regarding the geographic distribution and original ltv of our single family mortgage loan portfolio follows at year end dollars in millions california texas florida all other states single family mortgage loans weighted average original ltv at year end  we had million in single family loans in areas affected by hurricanes katrina  rita  and wilma 
of these  approximately million had flood insurance policies 
we have received very few notices from borrowers related to these loans regarding property damage affecting the collateral value or the borrower s ability to pay 
we do not anticipate any significant loan losses as a result of these hurricanes 
asset quality and allowance for loan losses various asset quality measures we monitor are at year end dollars in millions non performing loans restructured operating lease assets foreclosed real estate non performing assets non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets ratio allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in  we recognized million  and in we recognized million  in interest income as a result of payoffs received on loans for which we had previously applied interest payments received to reduce the carrying amount 
our allowance for losses on loans not determined to be individually impaired is based on estimated percentages of losses that have been incurred in the portfolio 
these estimated percentages are based on historical charge off rates adjusted for current market and environmental factors that we believe are not reflected in historical data 
we evaluate these estimated percentages annually and more frequently when portfolio characteristics change significantly 
considerations that influence our judgments regarding the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the amounts charged to expense include conditions affecting borrower liquidity and collateral values for impaired loans  risk characteristics for groups of loans that are not considered individually impaired but we believe have probable potential losses  risk characteristics for homogeneous pools of loans  and other risk factors that we believe are not apparent in historical information 

table of contents the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses for the year dollars in millions loans balance at beginning of year provision credit for loan losses net charge offs transfer to reserve for unfunded credit commitments balance at end of year unfunded credit commitments balance at beginning of year provision for commitment related credit losses net charge offs transfer from allowance for loan losses balance at end of year combined allowances for credit losses at year end provision credit for loan losses commitment related credit losses combined provision credit for credit losses net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding in  we recorded a provision for credit losses principally as a result of the deterioration of the loan and lease discussed below that we also charged off 
other than these items  the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve in considering this credit quality improvement  we reduced our allowance on commercial real estate and multi family loans and decreased our provision for credit losses by million 
as a result of these charge offs and the allowance reductions  our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans has decreased 
however  because of the overall improved credit quality of our portfolio  our allowance as a percent of non performing loans has increased 
in  we recorded a credit to provision expense as a result of similar credit quality improvements 
charge offs in included million related to a direct financing lease transaction with an automotive parts manufacturer that declared bankruptcy 
the bankruptcy trustee for the lessee rejected the lease and returned possession of the leased equipment to us 
we sold the equipment  incurring a loss for which we have filed a claim with the bankruptcy court along with claims for other contractually due amounts 
we sold our rights associated with the rejected lease to a third party  which will ultimately result in a recovery of a portion of our loss 
because that sale contract contains provisions that result in substantial uncertainty about the amount we will ultimately receive  we have not recognized any related recovery as of year end we also have another lease with the same lessee with a net carrying amount at year end of million 
that lease had not been rejected as of year end  however communications with the lessee subsequent to year end indicate it is likely the lessee will either reject the lease or we will be required to renegotiate its terms 
our non performing loans at year end do not include the lease discussed above and a loan to a chemical manufacturer that also had characteristics indicating potential credit problems that could result in this loan being classified as non performing in the future 
the loan had an unpaid principal balance at year end of million and is secured by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  and real estate 
the borrower is over advanced against eligible collateral in the amount of million  and we have had difficulty resolving the matter with the borrower 
charge offs in also included million on an asset based loan that was restructured in the borrower has continued to have financial difficulty since the restructuring  and we do not expect significant future payments 

table of contents charge offs in related principally to foreclosed real estate loans and several smaller asset based lending loans 
charge offs in related principally to two commercial real estate loans  two commercial and business loans  restructured aircraft leases  and several asset based lending loans 
in  we restructured two leveraged direct financing leases on cargo aircraft in which we are the lessor 
due to a reduction in the lease payments  we reclassified the leases as operating leases  recorded the aircraft on our balance sheet  wrote them down to fair value and designated them as non performing assets 
we are depreciating the aircraft over their remaining expected useful lives 
the net carrying value of the aircraft was million at year end  and we anticipate the carrying value will be million at the end of the lease terms in the lessee has made all lease payments in accordance with the restructured terms 
as a result of the lessee s improved financial performance  we no longer classify the restructured operating lease assets as non performing assets 
virtually all of our commercial real estate loans are collateralized and performing in accordance with contractual terms 
however  the borrowers on million of our senior housing and commercial real estate loans have completed construction and are nearing maturity of automatic or subsequently approved extensions 
we underwrote most of these loans with the expectation that the borrowers would secure permanent financing or sell the collateral before or upon maturity of our loan 
some of the borrowers with completed projects have not been able to achieve the lease up schedules originally anticipated 
although the current real estate environment is improving and we continue to receive a large number of payoffs on real estate loans  it is likely that we will further extend some of these loans 
we typically require loans to be current on all interest and other contractual payments and generally require substantial third party guarantees or other credit support to grant such extensions 
in  we foreclosed and sold collateral securing four real estate loans  resulting in charge offs and subsequent asset write downs of million 
it is possible that we will have to foreclose on additional commercial real estate loans in the future 
noninterest income and noninterest expenses fluctuations in our noninterest income and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions noninterest income loan origination and sale of loans servicing rights amortization and impairment real estate operations  net of cost of sales the decrease in in loan origination and sale of loans and servicing rights amortization and impairment was due to the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities and sale of our third party mortgage servicing in late  which also substantially reduced our noninterest expense 
the decrease in was principally due to the decline in mortgage loan origination activity as refinancing slowed considerably in income from our real estate operations  which includes sales of real estate less cost of sales and our equity in earnings of real estate partnerships  was comparable in to in  our real estate operations included our share of earnings from partnership investments we made in a number of condominium conversion projects in florida  whereas in it included a gain on the sale of a multifamily housing development 
year over year increase decrease in millions noninterest expense compensation and benefits real estate operations  excluding compensation a significant portion of our compensation expense in years prior to was related to our mortgage loan origination activity and was variable with origination volume 
the decrease in compensation and benefits 
table of contents expense in was principally a result of the repositioning of our mortgage activities 
changes in and were principally related to changes in mortgage loan origination volume 
in  we began a program to expand our banking center network by constructing new retail bank branches in key markets 
in future years  these new branches will provide us with additional deposit funding  including noninterest bearing deposits  and will increase our noninterest income  but will also increase our noninterest expense as a result of additional compensation and depreciation expense 
in  we opened six branches 
additionally  at year end we had two branches under construction and plans for an additional six new branches in real estate operations expense decreased in because we recorded impairment charges in on several assets held for sale  and included operating expenses of a multifamily housing development prior to its sale in mid information regarding our mortgage loan origination activities follows for the year in millions loans originated and retained loans originated for sale to third parties we no longer retain the rights to service loans nor do we retain any other interest in loans sold to third parties 
please read statistical and other data for additional information about our business segments and bank statistical disclosures 
expenses not allocated to segments unallocated expenses represent expenses managed on a company wide basis and include corporate general and administrative expense  share based compensation  other operating and non operating income expense  and parent company interest expense 
the change in general and administrative expenses was principally due to an increase in incentive compensation and supply chain initiatives and  in  to million in expenses related to our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of the change in share based compensation is due to the effects of prospectively expensing stock options using the fair value method beginning in and the increased use of share based compensation coupled with an increase in the market price of our common stock 
other operating income expense not allocated to business segments principally consists of costs associated with the closure of production and converting facilities  consolidation of administrative functions  repositioning our mortgage origination and servicing activities  losses on sales of non strategic assets  and in  costs associated with the gulf coast hurricanes and antitrust litigation 
please read note e to the parent company summarized financial statements and note l to the financial services summarized financial statements and litigation matters antitrust litigation for additional information 
the actions to close facilities  consolidate administrative functions  and reposition our mortgage origination and servicing activities were taken to lower costs  improve operating effectiveness  increase asset utilization  and as it relates to the mortgage origination and servicing activities  to reduce our exposure to changing market conditions 
we began to see the benefits of these actions in and  and it is likely that trend will continue into we will continue our efforts to enhance return on investment by lowering costs  improving operating efficiencies and increasing asset utilization 
as a result  we will continue to review operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determine appropriate courses of action  including consolidating and closing converting facilities and selling under performing assets 
other non operating income expense principally consists of interest and other income and costs associated with debt tender offers  call premiums and write offs of unamortized financing fees related to refinancing of borrowings in and early repayments of borrowings in and the change in parent company interest expense was due to a change in the mix of our long term debt 
at year end  we had billion of debt with fixed interest rates that averaged percent and million of debt with variable interest rates that averaged percent 
this compares with billion of debt with 
table of contents fixed interest rates that averaged percent and million of debt with variable interest rates that averaged percent at year end income taxes our effective tax rate  which is income tax as a percentage of income from continuing operations before taxes  was a tax expense of percent in  a tax expense of percent in  and a tax benefit of percent in these rates reflect one time benefits of six percent in resulting from the sale of a foreign subsidiary and eight percent in and percent in resulting from the resolution of tax examinations and claims discussed below 
the american job creation act of did not significantly affect our effective tax rate 
in  the internal revenue service concluded its examination of our tax returns for the years through  and we resolved several state income tax examinations 
in  the internal revenue service concluded its examination of our tax returns through  including matters related to net operating losses and minimum tax credit carryforwards  which resulted from certain deductions following the acquisition of guaranty and for which no financial accounting benefit had been recognized 
also in  we resolved certain state tax refund claims for the years through as a result  valuation allowances and tax accruals previously provided for these matters were no longer required  and in fourth quarter we recognized a one time benefit of million and in second quarter we recognized a one time benefit of million 
based on our current expectations of income and expense  it is likely that our effective tax rate will approximate percent 
average shares outstanding the change in average shares outstanding was principally due to the exercise of employee stock options  the settlement of the upper decs equity purchase contracts  and repurchases of common stock 
the change in average diluted shares outstanding was principally due to the above factors and the dilutive effect of employee stock options resulting from the increase in the market price of our common stock in and capital resources and liquidity for the year we separately discuss our capital resources and liquidity for temple inland and our manufacturing subsidiaries  which we refer to as the parent company  and our financial services subsidiaries in order for the reader to better understand our different businesses and because almost all of the net assets invested in financial services are subject to regulatory rules and regulations including restrictions on the payment of dividends to the parent company

we operate in cyclical industries and our operating cash flows vary accordingly 
our principal operating cash requirements are for compensation  wood and recycled fiber  energy  interest and taxes 
in and  we experienced improved pricing and shipments for most of our products compared with decreases experienced during most of our discontinued operations sources and uses of cash  which is principally derived from operating activities  was not significant 
the dividends we receive from financial services are dependent on its level of earnings and capital needs and are subject to regulatory approval and restrictions 
it is likely that we will receive significantly higher dividends in than we did in working capital is subject to cyclical operating needs  the timing of collection of receivables and the payment of payables and expenses and  to a lesser extent  to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
in and  many of our employees took advantage of the increasing spread between the market price of our common stock and the exercise price of employee stock options and exercised their stock options 
as a result  we issued  net shares of common stock in and  net shares in to employees exercising options 
in addition  in  we issued  shares of our common stock and received million in cash in conjunction with the final settlement of our upper decs equity purchase contracts 
in  market conditions provided the opportunity to lengthen our debt maturity profile in a cost effective manner 
as a result  we issued million of debt due in and million of debt due in the proceeds were used to retire debt due in and in and  we used portions of our available funds to retire higher interest rate debt and long term timber rights purchase obligations 
we paid cash dividends to shareholders of per share in  per share in including a per share special dividend in december  and per share in in february  our board of directors approved a repurchase program of up to million shares 
in august  our board of 
table of contents directors approved a repurchase program of up to an additional million shares 
in  we repurchased million shares for million  including million included in other current liabilities that was settled after year end 
the repurchased shares were added to treasury shares at an average price of per share 
capital expenditures and timberland reforestation and acquisitions were percent of depreciation and amortization in  percent in  and percent in most of the expenditures relate to initiatives to increase reliability and efficiency at our linerboard mills 
capital expenditures and timberland reforestation and acquisitions are expected to approximate million in or about percent of expected depreciation and amortization 
financial services sources and uses of cash for the year in millions we received cash from operations changes in loans held for sale  and other from operations change in deposits and borrowings sale of non strategic assets and collection of mortgage servicing rights sale receivables total sources we used cash to pay dividends to the parent company a reinvest in the business through loans and securities  net of payments capital expenditures  acquisitions and other uses total uses change in cash and cash equivalents a dividends we pay to the parent company are eliminated in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal operating cash requirements are for compensation  interest  and taxes 
changes in loans held for sale are subject to the timing of the origination and subsequent sale of the loans and the level of refinancing activity 
as a result of the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities  it is likely that the cash flow related to these activities will increase in as we sell the remaining loans held for sale and will decrease thereafter 
the changes in deposits and borrowings and the amounts invested in loans and securities generally move in tandem because we use deposits and borrowings to fund these investments 
fluctuations over the last several years are principally due to changes in the volume of refinancing activities as well as the level of suitable commercial lending and securities purchase opportunities 
in  our asset growth limited the amount of dividends that we were able to pay because of the associated increased regulatory capital requirements 
it is likely that our earning assets will remain near the same level in as in as a result  it is likely that we will pay significantly higher dividends to the parent company in than we did in liquidity and contractual obligations almost all of the net assets invested in financial services are subject to regulatory rules and restrictions including restrictions on the payment of dividends to the parent company 
as a result  all consolidated assets are not available to satisfy all consolidated liabilities 
to provide a clearer understanding of our different businesses  we discuss our contractual obligations for the parent company and financial services separately 
at 
table of contents year end our consolidated contractual obligations separated between the parent company and financial services consist of payments due or expiring by year total thereafter in millions parent company long term debt capital lease obligations less  related municipal bonds we own contractual interest payments on fixed rate long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total parent company financial services transaction and savings deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb borrowings  repurchase agreements and other borrowings preferred stock issued by subsidiaries contractual interest payments operating leases total financial services total consolidated denotes items included in our balance sheet 
parent company liquidity and contractual obligations our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  dividends received from financial services  and borrowings under our committed credit agreements and existing accounts receivable securitization facility 
our contractual obligations due in will likely be repaid from our operating cash flow or from our unused borrowing capacity 
at year end  we had million in unused borrowing capacity under our credit agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility accounts receivable credit securitization agreements facility total committed less borrowings and commitments unused borrowing capacity at year end our committed credit agreements include a million revolving credit facility that expires in the remainder of the committed agreements expire in july in january  we exercised our option to increase the commitments under our revolving credit facility by million  increasing total committed credit capacity to  million 
also in january  we used million of our credit facilities to fund the purchase of the remaining percent interest in standard gypsum lp 
following the purchase we paid off million of the venture s long term debt  of which million was related to the purchased interest 
our accounts receivable securitization facility expires in under this facility  a wholly owned subsidiary purchases  on an on going basis  substantially all of our trade receivables 
as we need funds  the 
table of contents subsidiary draws under its revolving credit agreement  pledges the trade receivables as collateral  and remits the proceeds to us 
in the event of liquidation of the subsidiary  its creditors would be entitled to satisfy their claims from the subsidiary s pledged receivables prior to distributions back to us 
we included this subsidiary in our parent company and consolidated financial statements 
our debt agreements  accounts receivable securitization facility  and credit agreements contain terms  conditions and financial covenants customary for such agreements including minimum levels of interest coverage and limitations on leverage 
at year end  we complied with these terms  conditions and financial covenants 
none of the agreements are restricted as to availability based on our long term debt ratings 
on february   our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate to per share from per share 
in the s  we entered into two sale lease back transactions of production facilities with municipalities 
we entered into these transactions to mitigate property and similar taxes associated with these facilities 
the municipalities purchased these facilities from us for million  our carrying value  and we leased the facilities back from the municipalities under lease agreements  which expire in and concurrently  we purchased million of interest bearing bonds issued by these municipalities 
the bond terms are identical to the lease terms  are secured by payments under the capital lease obligations  and the municipalities are obligated only to the extent the underlying lease payments are made by us 
the interest rate implicit in the leases is the same as the interest rate on the bonds 
as a result  the present value of the capital lease obligations is million  the same as the principal amount of the bonds 
since there is no legal right of offset  the million of bonds are included in other assets and the million present value of the capital lease obligations are included in other long term liabilities 
there is no net effect from these transactions as we are in substance both the obligor on  and the holder of  the bonds 
operating leases represent pre tax obligations and include million for the lease of particleboard and mdf facilities in mt 
jewett pennsylvania  which expire in the rest of our operating lease obligations are for timberland  facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations are pre tax  market priced obligations principally for gypsum and timber used in our manufacturing and converting processes and for major committed capital expenditures 
we have other long term liabilities  principally defined benefit and postretirement medical obligations and deferred income taxes that are not included in the table because they do not have scheduled maturities 
at year end  the pre tax pension liability was million and the pre tax postretirement medical liability was million 
please read pension  postretirement medical and health care matters for additional information 
we do not expect any significant changes in our deferred tax liability in however  it is possible that in we will have used all our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
as a result  it is likely that in and thereafter  we will pay federal income taxes at a percent rate as compared with the percent rate we have paid for a number of years 
we have interest rate derivative instruments outstanding at year end these interest rate instruments expire in they are non exchange traded and are valued using either third party resources or models 
at year end  the aggregate fair value of our interest rate instruments was a million liability 
our commodity derivative instruments expired in financial services liquidity and contractual obligations our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  new deposits  borrowings under our existing agreements and  if necessary  sales of assets 
assets that can be readily converted to cash  or against which we can readily borrow  include short term investments  loans  mortgage loans held for sale  and securities 
at year end  we had available liquidity of billion 
our contractual obligations due in will likely be repaid from operating cash flow and retention of deposits 
our transaction and savings deposit accounts are shown as maturing in these accounts do not have a contractual maturity  but rather  are due on demand 
most of the certificates of deposit that mature in are short term one year or less and a high percentage of the depositors have historically renewed at maturity  although they have no contractual obligation to do so 

table of contents unless renegotiated  the terms of the preferred stock issued by subsidiaries make it likely that we will redeem the preferred stock in at the liquidation preference amount of million 
loans and securities aggregating billion are pledged as collateral on federal home loan bank or fhlb borrowings 
based upon this collateral  we have the ability to borrow an additional billion from the fhlb  which is included in our available liquidity 
operating lease obligations are principally for facilities and equipment 
off balance sheet arrangements parent company it is not our practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
from time to time  however  we do so to facilitate our operating activities 
at year end  our off balance sheet unfunded arrangements  excluding contractual interest payments  operating leases and purchase and other obligations included in the table of contractual obligations  consisted of expiring by year total thereafter in millions joint venture guarantees performance bonds and recourse obligations total we participate in three joint ventures engaged in manufacturing and selling paper and forest products 
our partner in each of these ventures is a publicly held company unrelated to us 
at year end  these ventures had million in long term debt and million of debt included in current maturities  along with various letters of credit 
we guaranteed million of the joint ventures debt service obligations and letters of credit 
our joint venture partners also provided guarantees and letters of credit 
generally we would be called upon to fund the guarantees due to the lack of specific performance by the joint ventures  such as non payment of debt 
as a result of the purchase of the remaining percent interest in standard gypsum lp in january and the payment of its million credit agreement  million of the joint venture guarantees have been eliminated 
performance bonds are primarily for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we had guaranteed the repayment of million of borrowings by a financial services subsidiary 
this borrowing was refinanced after year end and the guarantee was eliminated 
in addition  million preferred stock issued by two subsidiaries of guaranty is automatically exchanged into preferred stock of guaranty upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events or administrative actions 
if such exchange occurs  certain shares are automatically surrendered to us in exchange for our senior notes and certain shares  at our option  are either exchanged for our senior notes or are purchased by us 
financial services in the normal course of business  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements  such as commitments to extend credit for loans  leases  and letters of credit 
these commitments carry substantially the same risk as loans 
we generally require collateral upon funding of these commitments  the receipt of which provides assets that generally increase our liquidity by increasing our borrowing capacity 
these commitments normally include provisions allowing us to exit the commitment under certain circumstances 
at year end  our off 
table of contents balance sheet unfunded arrangements  excluding contractual interest and operating leases included in the table of contractual obligations  consisted of expiring by year total thereafter in millions single family mortgage loans unused lines of credit unfunded portion of credit commitments commitments to originate commercial loans letters of credit total capital adequacy and other regulatory matters at year end  guaranty met or exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
we expect to maintain guaranty s capital at a level that exceeds the minimum required for designation as well capitalized under the capital adequacy regulations of the ots 
from time to time  the parent company may make capital contributions to or receive dividends from guaranty 
please read note m to the financial services summarized financial statements for additional information 
at year end  guaranty had outstanding preferred stock of subsidiaries with a carrying amount and liquidation value of million 
this preferred stock will be automatically exchanged into guaranty preferred stock if the ots determines guaranty is or will become undercapitalized in the near term or upon the occurrence of certain administrative actions 
if such an exchange were to occur  the parent company must issue senior notes in exchange for the guaranty preferred stock in an amount equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred stock exchanged 
with respect to certain of these shares  the parent company has the option to issue senior notes or purchase the shares 
at year end  million of the subsidiary preferred stock qualified as core capital and the remainder qualified as tier capital 
as previously disclosed  in the ots and guaranty entered into a stipulation and consent to the issuance of an order to cease and desist for affirmative relief consent order related to findings and required corrective actions associated with guaranty s mortgage origination activities 
under the consent order  guaranty agreed  among other things  to take certain actions primarily related to its repositioned mortgage origination activities  including strengthening its regulatory compliance controls and management  enhancing its suspicious activity reporting and regulatory training programs  and implementing improved risk assessment and loan application register programs 
guaranty has implemented the corrective actions necessitated by the consent order 
additionally  we further repositioned our mortgage origination activities in  substantially reducing the volume of activity to which the corrective actions apply 
the consent order remains in effect  but has had no significant on going impact on the operations of guaranty or its ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
we have not incurred any significant financial loss as a result of this matter and have no reason to believe that the matters addressed in the consent order will have a significant effect on guaranty s long term operations or cash flows 
pension  postretirement medical and health care matters our non cash pension expense was million in  million in  and million in for the year  we expect our non cash pension expense to be about million 
for accounting purposes  we measure the defined benefit plans projected benefit obligation  value the plan assets  and determine the funded status as of september of each year 
we measure our projected benefit obligation using current mortality tables and an appropriate discount rate 
at september  the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million compared with million at september the change was principally due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate to percent offset by better than expected return on plan assets percent compared with an expected rate of percent and larger plan assets due in part to the million of voluntary  discretionary contributions we made in the pension liability recognized for accounting purposes was million at year end compared with million at year end unrecognized actuarial losses  which principally 
table of contents represent the delayed recognition of the effect of changes in the assumed discount rate and differences between expected and actual experience  were million at year end and million at year end these losses  to the extent they exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or plan assets  will be recognized prospectively over the remaining service period  currently estimated at nine years  and will be affected by further changes  if any  in the discount rate and differences between expected and actual experience 
we expect the amount to be recognized and included in pension expense will be about million  the same as included in pension expense 
for erisa funding purposes  we measure the projected benefit obligation and value the plan assets as of january of each year 
we measure our projected benefit obligations using a discount rate that approximates the expected return on plan assets and value our plan assets using a five year moving average 
at january   the projected benefit obligation approximated the fair value of the plan assets 
as a result  our erisa cash funding requirement was about million in  and we expect our cash funding requirement to be minimal in we made voluntary  discretionary contributions of million to the defined benefit plans in and it is likely that we will make additional voluntary  discretionary contributions to the defined benefit plans in of million  million per quarter 
postretirement medical expense was million in  million in  and million in for accounting purposes we measure the projected benefit obligation using current mortality tables and an appropriate discount rate  currently percent 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was enacted in december this act expands medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
our postretirement benefit plans provide for medical coverage  including a prescription drug subsidy  for certain participants 
the effect of the act was to reduce the liability for postretirement medical cost by million and reduce postretirement medical expense by about million 
effective january  we implemented a new consumer driven health plan option for our employees 
about percent of our employees elected this option 
we believe implementing this option will reduce or help mitigate our rising health care costs 
in  the total cost of providing health coverage was about million of which we incurred million and our employees incurred million 
in  the total cost of providing health coverage was million  of which we incurred million and our employees incurred million 
the reduction in total health care cost is principally due to the implementation of a new health plan design  including the consumer driven health plan option  and a decrease in employees 
it is unlikely that this trend will continue in energy and the effects of inflation energy costs increased million in  million in  and million in  principally due to changes in natural gas prices 
our energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
we hedge very little of our energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the last three years 
our fixed assets  timber and timberland  are carried at their historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  depreciation expense and the cost of timber cut or timberland sold would be significantly higher than what we reported 
environmental protection our operations are subject to federal  state  and local provisions regulating discharges into the environment and otherwise related to the protection of the environment 
compliance with these provisions requires us to invest substantial funds to modify facilities to assure compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
a more detailed discussion regarding our compliance with environment regulation can be found in business environmental regulation 
litigation matters we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
in our opinion  the possibility of a material loss from any of these proceedings is considered to be remote  and we do not expect that the effect of these proceedings will be material to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period 
a more detailed discussion regarding our most significant litigation matters can be found in legal proceedings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current level of interest rate risk is primarily due to the lending and funding activities of our financial services segment 
the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months at year end  with comparative year end information 
this estimate considers the effects of changing prepayment speeds  repricing characteristics and average balances over the next months 
increase decrease in income before taxes at year end at year end change in parent financial parent financial interest rates company services company services in millions n a n a we did not present a two percent interest rate decrease scenario at year end because of the then current low interest rate environment 
the analysis assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term variable rate debt 
however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose to follow 
parent company interest rate risk is related to our long term debt and our interest rate swaps 
because parent company debt is primarily fixed rate  interest rate changes are not expected to affect earnings significantly 
however  interest rate changes will affect the value of the interest rate swap agreements currently million notional amount 
we believe that any changes in value would not be significant 
our financial services segment is subject to interest rate risk to the extent interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repay or reprice at different times or in differing amounts or both 
our financial services segment interest rate sensitivity has changed from year end due principally to balance sheet growth in mortgage assets  primarily option arms that reset monthly to an index that lags market rate 
table of contents movements  the purchase of which was funded with short term borrowings 
also contributing to the change in sensitivity is a shorter maturity profile on our certificate of deposit portfolio 
foreign currency risk we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on our financial instruments because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk from time to time we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in product pricing and manufacturing costs 
these instruments cover a small portion of our volume and range in duration from three months to three years 
considering the fair value of these instruments at year end  we believe the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity prices would not be significant
