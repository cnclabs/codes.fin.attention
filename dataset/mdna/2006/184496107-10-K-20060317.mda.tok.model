readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements 
readers should also carefully review the risk factors described in other documents which we file from time to time with the sec  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by us during overview we provide a wide range of environmental services and solutions to a diversified customer base in the united states  puerto rico  mexico and canada 
we seek to be recognized by customers as the premier supplier of a broad range of value added environmental services based upon quality  responsiveness  customer service  information technologies  breadth of product offerings and cost effectiveness 
effective september   we purchased from safety kleen services  inc and certain of its domestic subsidiaries collectively  the sellers substantially all of the assets of the chemical services division the csd of safety kleen corp 
safety kleen 
that acquisition broadened our disposal capabilities  geographic reach and significantly expanded our network of hazardous waste disposal facilities 
following the acquisition  we became one of the largest providers of environmental services and the largest operator of hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities in north america 
the acquisition of csd s hazardous waste facilities allowed us to expand our site and industrial services in new geographic areas 
the acquisition also resulted in significant cost savings by allowing us to treat and dispose of hazardous waste internally for which we previously paid third parties and to eliminate redundant selling  general and administrative expenses and inefficient transportation costs 
the assets of the csd including the assets of the csd canadian subsidiaries which we acquired consist primarily of hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities including  among others  transportation  storage or disposal facilities five of which have since been closed by us  six wastewater treatment facilities one of which has since been closed by us  nine commercial landfills and four incineration facilities 
such facilities are located in states  puerto rico  six canadian provinces and mexico 
the most significant of such facilities include landfills in buttonwillow  california with approximately million cubic yards of remaining capacity  in lambton  ontario with approximately million cubic yards of remaining capacity  which is the largest of the three hazardous waste landfills in canada  and in waynoka  oklahoma with approximately million cubic yards of remaining capacity  and incinerators in deer park  texas which is the largest hazardous waste incineration facility in the united states  and in aragonite  utah 
additional significant facilities are the incinerators in mercier  quebec and lambton  ontario 
we have accrued environmental liabilities  valued as of december   at approximately million  substantially all of which we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the csd assets 
we now anticipate such liabilities will be payable over many years and that cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the payment of such liabilities when required 
however  events not now anticipated such as future changes in environmental laws and regulations could require that such payments be made earlier or in greater amounts than now anticipated 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
the following are the areas that we believe require the greatest amount of judgments or estimates in the preparation of the financial statements revenue allowance  deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for landfills  testing long lived assets and goodwill for impairment  environmental liabilities  insurance expense  legal matters  and provision for income taxes 
our management discusses each of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors prior to each release of our annual financial statements 
revenue allowance 
we respond to emergencies that pose an immediate threat to public health or the environment and must take action in the field as events unfold 
historically  once the emergency is contained  customers may withhold payment and attempt to renegotiate amounts invoiced 
accordingly  we establish a revenue allowance to cover the estimated amounts of revenue that may need to be credited to customers accounts in future periods 
the allowance is established based on experience and  when available  based on specific information relating to jobs performed 
deferred revenue 
in accordance with customary practice in the environmental services industry  we normally submit a bill for services shortly after waste is collected from a customer location and prior to completion of the waste disposal process 
we recognize revenue for waste disposal services only when the waste is placed into a landfill  incinerated  treated in a wastewater treatment facility or shipped to a third party for disposal 
the amount of deferred revenue stated on our balance sheet as of december  was million 
because a large quantity of waste is on hand and in transit at the end of any month  waste from various sources is mixed subsequent to receipt  waste is received in various size containers  and the amount of waste per container can vary significantly  the calculation of deferred revenue requires the use of significant estimates such as of the average revenue charged for a type of waste and of the average waste volume contained within various size containers 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectibility of accounts that are large or past due 
in addition  we consider historical bad debts and current economic trends in evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable written off in subsequent periods can differ materially from the allowance for doubtful accounts provided 
accounting for landfills 
we utilize the life cycle method of accounting for landfill costs and the units of consumption method to amortize landfill construction and asset retirement costs and record closure and post closure obligations over the estimated remaining useful life of a landfill 
under this method  we include future estimated construction and asset retirement costs  as well as costs incurred to date  in the amortization base 
additionally  we include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted costs in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill 
this accounting method requires us to make estimates and assumptions  as described below 
any changes in our estimates will impact our income from operations prospectively from the date the changes are made 
landfill assets we assess the total cost to develop each landfill site to its capacity based on highly probable airspace 
this includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events 
the total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs and construction costs 
closure and post closure costs the costs for closure and post closure obligations at landfills we own or operate are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
the estimates for landfill cell closure  final closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain 
available airspace our engineers and accountants determine the useful life of our landfills by estimating the available airspace 
this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate  based on height restrictions and other factors  how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity 
expansion airspace we apply a comprehensive set of criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining a permit for future expansion airspace at existing sites  which provides management a sufficient basis to evaluate the likelihood of success of unpermitted expansions 
these criteria are as follows personnel are actively working to obtain the permit or permit modifications land use  state and federal necessary for expansion of an existing landfill  and progress is being made on the project 
we expect to submit the application within the next year and expect to receive all necessary approvals to accept waste within the next five years 
at the time the expansion is included in our estimate of the landfill s useful economic life  it is probable that the required approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located 
the owner of the landfill or we have a legal right to use or obtain land associated with the expansion plan 
there are no significant known political  technical  legal  or business restrictions or issues that could impair the success of such expansion 
a financial feasibility analysis has been completed and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact such that management is committed to pursuing the expansion 
additional airspace and related additional costs  including permitting  final closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on the conceptual design of the proposed expansion 
these criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
however  our policy provides that  based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill  inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed even if these criteria are not met 
in these circumstances  inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific process that includes approval of our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace  we also include the projected costs for final capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
it is possible that any of our estimates or assumptions could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from actual results 
in some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable has become unlikely 
to the extent that such estimates  or the assumptions used to make those estimates  prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner  the costs of the landfill  including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion  may be subject to impairment testing  as described below  and lower prospective profitability may be experienced due to increased interest accretion and depreciation or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace 
long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
when indicators of potential impairment are present  the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is recognized whenever anticipated future cash flows undiscounted from an asset are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of the impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
goodwill 
beginning in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
environmental liabilities 
as more fully discussed under item  business environmental regulation  our waste management facilities are continuously regulated by federal  state  provincial and local laws enacted to regulate discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise protect the environment 
in addition  in connection with our acquisition of the assets of the csd in september  we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities of the sellers as part of the purchase price for the csd assets 
as of december   we had recorded discounted remedial liabilities of million 
we also estimate that it is reasonably possible as that term is defined in sfas no 
more than remote but less than likely  that the amount of such remedial liabilities could be up to million greater than such million 
remedial liabilities are inherently difficult to estimate 
estimating remedial liabilities requires that the existing environmental contamination be understood 
there is a risk that the actual quantities of contaminates differ from the results of the site investigation  and there is a risk that contaminants exist that have not been identified by the site investigation 
in addition  the amount of remedial liabilities recorded is dependent on the remedial method selected 
there is a risk that funds will be expended on a remedial solution that is not successful  which could result in the additional incremental costs of an alternative solution 
changes in estimates for remedial liabilities are recorded through selling  general and administrative expenses 
such estimates  which are subject to change  are subsequently revised if and when additional information becomes available 
in addition  we must estimate the timing of payments for environmental liabilities years into the future 
because most of our environmental liabilities are discounted to reflect the respective dates on which we expect to make environmental expenditures  significant acceleration in the timing of payments could result in material charges to earnings 
net reductions in our estimates of environmental liabilities  and changes in our estimate of the timing of payments  resulted in increases to our reported results of operations of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
insurance expense 
it is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain expected losses related primarily to workers compensation  health insurance  comprehensive general and vehicle liability 
accruals are established for incurred losses based on information that is known at the time 
recording health insurance expense requires that estimates be made of the cost of health benefits to be provided in future periods 
actual expenditures required in future periods can differ materially from accruals established based on estimates 
as described in our annual report on form k a for the year ended december   we restated our financial statements for the years ended december  and  and financial information for the year ended december   in order to correct errors relating to the methodology we had established for estimating our workers compensation and motor vehicle liability claims 
the effect of the restatement was to increase cost of revenues by million for each of the years ended december  and legal matters 
as described in note  legal proceedings  to the financial statements included in
