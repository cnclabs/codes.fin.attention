overview trio tech international provides third party semiconductor testing and burn in services primarily through its laboratories in southeast asia 
we operate in three distinct segments distribution  manufacturing  and testing 
at or from our facilities in california and southeast asia  we also design  manufacture and market equipment and systems to be used in the testing and production of semiconductors  and distribute semiconductor processing and testing equipment manufactured by other vendors 
geographically  we operate in the us  singapore  malaysia  thailand  and china 
our customers are mainly concentrated in southeast asia and they are either semiconductor chip manufacturers or testing facilities that purchase our testing equipment 
our major operation activities are conducted in our singapore location 
there are manufacturing  testing and distribution facilities 
we have four testing facilities located in singapore  malaysia  thailand  and china 
all of the facilities in southeast asia except the facility located in shanghai  china  are iso  iso  and qs certified 
we use our own proprietary equipment for certain burn in  centrifugal and leak tests  and commercially available equipment for various other environmental tests 
in august  we established a winding down plan to close the testing operation in dublin  ireland 
this was initially disclosed in the form k for the fiscal year ended june  based on the restructuring plan and in accordance with eitf  we presented the operation results from ireland as a discontinued operation as we believed that no continued cash flow would be generated by the disposed component ireland subsidiary and we would have no significant continuing involvement in the operation of the discontinued component 
management of the company initiated a plan to sell the property located in dublin  ireland in august and ceased the depreciation of the property in accordance with sfas no 
we transferred the relevant machinery and equipment to singapore and paid the outstanding balance on the equipment loans 
as a result  the machinery and equipment located in dublin  ireland was not included in the assets held for sale 
management of the company presented the property as assets held for sale for the three months ended september  as this property was available for immediate sale in its then present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such property  the sale of the property was probable  and transfer of the property was expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year 
in november  we completed the sale of property located in dublin  ireland and recorded a gain on the sale of property of  as a result  this discontinued operation reported an income of  which consisted of the gain from the sale of property of  offset by the operating loss from the discontinued operation of for basis of comparison  the financial statements related to the discontinued operation are now presented separately in this report under discontinued operations 
in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations  for basis of comparison  the amounts used in comparison have been reclassified to exclude the amounts from discontinued operations  which have been discussed as a separate line item listed on the statement of income 

table of contents in january  we completed the acquisition of a burn in testing division in shanghai  as management believed that acquiring the burn in testing business would enhance our future growth opportunities and develop additional market share in china testing services 
we allocated the purchase price of to tangible assets and intangible assets acquired in the newly acquired burn in business in shanghai based on their estimated fair value 
we estimated that the book value of the fixed assets acquired approximated the fair value of similar assets available on the market based on the information management received 
accordingly  we allocated to various items of fixed assets acquired and to other receivables 
the excess purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets acquired  which was  was attributable to an identifiable intangible asset  the customer relationship  based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the economic life of this identified intangible asset was estimated to be about one year based on management assumptions 
therefore  the value of would be amortized over one year on the straight line method 
no goodwill was recognized 
the following presents the allocation of purchase price purchase price paid in cash property  plant and equipment plant and equipment office equipment motor vehicle subtotal other receivables total fair value of tangible assets acquired identifiable intangible asset customer relationship purchase price critical accounting estimates policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition presented in this section are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  returns  pricing concessions  bad debts  inventories  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under current conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policy  we have identified the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends 
we determine that those critical accounting policies are related to the use of estimates  inventory valuation  allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  income tax and impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets 
these accounting policies are discussed in the relevant sections in this management s discussion and analysis  including the recently issued accounting pronouncements discussed below 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts during the normal course of business  we extend unsecured credit to our customers 
typically  credit terms require payment to be made between to days of the sales 
we do not require collateral from our customers 
we maintain our cash accounts at credit worthy financial institutions 
we regularly evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of each customer on a case by case basis 
we include any account balances that are determined to be uncollectible  along with a general reserve  in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to management  we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of june  inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we write down inventories for not saleable  excess or obsolete raw 
table of contents materials  works in process and finished goods by charging such write downs to cost of sales 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  statistics and judgments are used for assessing provision of the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of the company s products is recognized upon shipment or delivery  depending upon the terms of the sales order  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the sales amount is fixed and determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
we allocate a portion of the invoice value to products sold and the remaining portion of invoice value to installation and training work in proportion to the fair value of products sold and installation and training work to be performed 
the fair value determination of products sold and the installation and training work is also based on our specific historical experience of the relative fair values of the elements if there is no easily observable market price to be considered 
a significant portion of the company s sales is generated by testing services 
revenue derived from testing service is recognized when testing services are rendered 
the company reduces revenue based on estimates of future credits to be granted to customers 
credits are granted for reasons such as product returns due to quality issues  volume based incentives  and other special pricing arrangements 
income tax we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
during the process of determining tax liabilities  we have to deal with uncertainties involved in the application of complex tax laws 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the regions or counties where they operate 
because of the different income tax jurisdictions  net losses generated in the us cannot be utilized to offset the taxable income generated in foreign countries 
therefore  we may incur certain income tax expenses in any fiscal year while the company  on a consolidated basis  may report a loss before income taxes 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable 
in this process  certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carry backs  and taxable income in future years 
our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
for us income tax purposes no provision has been made for us taxes on undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries with which the company intends to continue to reinvest 
in addition to the risks described above  the effective tax rate is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when certain indicators are present that suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review process primarily focuses on other intangible assets from business acquisitions and property  plant and equipment 
factors considered include the under performance of a business compared to expectations and shortened useful lives due to planned changes in the use of the assets 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of long lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
additionally  in the case of assets that will continue to be used by the company in future periods  a shortened life may be utilized if appropriate  resulting in accelerated amortization or depreciation based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilized by the company 
actual results may vary from estimates due to  among other things  differences in operating results  shorter asset useful lives and lower market values for excess assets 

table of contents executive summary consolidated operating results revenue increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal net income in fiscal was  or per diluted share  which included an income of  from discontinued operations 
in fiscal  the following significant events took place we closed our operation in ireland in november  we acquired a testing business in shanghai  china in january  and we distributed a cash dividend of per share  totaling  distributed 
in fiscal  one significant event took place we acquired a testing business in malaysia in july general financial information during the fiscal year ended june   total assets increased by  from  at june  to  at june  the majority of the increase was in cash  short term deposits  accounts receivables  inventory  prepaid expenses and other assets  but offset with a decrease of in property  plant and equipment and a decrease of in other intangibles 
cash and short term deposits at june  totaled  an increase of  or  compared to a total of  at june  during fiscal  cash increased due mainly to the net proceeds of  received from the sale of property in dublin  ireland  the receipt of in proceeds from the exercising of stock options  and the proceeds of  from long term debt 
however  this increase in cash and short term deposits was offset by capital expenditures of  the repayments of an aggregate  for the reduction in debts and capital leases which included the repayment of to the outstanding equipment loans located in ireland  the payment of dividends totaling  and net repayments of on the lines of credit 
accounts receivable at june  was  an increase of  or  compared to  at june  the increase was attributable mainly to higher sales from the testing and manufacturing segments in southeast asia in fiscal  compared to the same category of revenue in fiscal the total sales from all three segments for fiscal were  an increase of  or  compared to the total sales of  for fiscal the turnover of accounts receivables was days for fiscal  an increased of days or  compared to days for fiscal the increase in the turnover days of accounts receivable was a result of the increase in sales in the manufacturing segment located in singapore to a major customer with a credit term of days during june inventory at june  was  increased by  or  compared to  at june  the increase was due mainly to more purchases by the manufacturing segment as a result of an increase in sales in that segment 
the turnover of inventory was days for fiscal  increased by days  or  compared to days for fiscal property  plant and equipment at june  were  decreased by  or  compared to  at june  capital expenditures for fiscal were  decreased by  or  compared to  for fiscal the decrease in capital expenditures was a result of purchasing machinery and equipment for the acquired testing operation located in malaysia during fiscal in order to meet customers demands  whereas no such additions were required in total liabilities at june  were  increased by  or  compared to  at june  the increase in liabilities was mainly due to the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses  income tax payable and notes payable  offset by the decrease in lines of credit 
accounts payable at june  increased by  from in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in accounts payable was a result of the increase in material purchases to support the sales backlog in the singapore manufacturing segment in order to satisfy future delivery requirements 
income tax payable increased by  from for fiscal to for fiscal in the singapore operations  which was attributed mainly to the increase in taxable income 
lines of credit decreased by as a result of the repayments made by our singapore subsidiaries in the normal course of business 

table of contents comparison of operation results comparison of fiscal and the following table presents certain data from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss loss gain on disposal of pp e total operating expenses income from operations overall revenue the overall revenue is composed of the revenues from the manufacturing  testing and distribution segments 
the following table presents the components of the overall revenue realized in fiscal and in percentage format  respectively 
years ended june  revenues manufacturing testing distribution total net sales for fiscal were  an increase of  or  compared to  for fiscal the increase in net sales can be discussed within three segments 
as a percentage of the total revenue  the revenue generated by the manufacturing segment for fiscal was almost the same as the revenue in fiscal however  in terms of dollar amount  the revenue for fiscal was  an increase of  or  compared to  for fiscal we believe that the increase in revenue generated by the manufacturing segment was due to a greater demand from the personal computer market in asia  which in turn led to a greater demand for our products 
the demand for our burn in systems appeared to increase concurrently with the demand for more microprocessor chips in southeast asia 
such increase resulted from an increase in demand from one of our major customers  which was a result of that customer s growing share in the market for chips in personal computers 
due to the competitive environment in the manufacturing segment  we anticipate that we will continue to implement our cost reduction plan by outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing process to outside suppliers  such as electrical and mechanical fabrication houses  and seek competitively priced materials 
the backlog in the manufacturing segment increased by more than  from in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to demand for more microprocessor chips in southeast asia 
as a percentage of the total revenue  the revenue generated by the testing segment in fiscal accounted for of total sales  representing an increase of  compared to in fiscal in terms of dollar amount  the revenue for fiscal was  reflecting an increase of  or  compared to  for fiscal the increase in revenue generated by the testing segment was attributable to our testing operations in singapore and malaysia 
these operations achieved better sales performances  compared to their performance in fiscal  due to a hike in demand for testing services in southeast asia 
we believe that the increase in demand for testing services resulted from the strong economic growth and robust 
table of contents development in the electronics manufacturing industries in china 
in addition  an increase in demand from one of our customers with regard to its high end personal computers  notebooks and server chips also contributed to the increase 
demand for testing services varies from time to time depending on changes taken place on the market and our customers forecasts 
we anticipate that our customers will continue to request our services to perform burn in on chips to be used in wireless handsets  automotive applications and wired communications  all of which are currently in high demand in their respective markets 
our testing facilities provide customers with a full range of testing services  such as burn in and product life testing for finished semiconductors or packaged components 
the acquisition of a testing operation in shanghai in january is expected to pave a road for us to expand our testing and burn in services in china s market 
backlog in the testing segment at june  was  an increase of  or  compared to  at june  due to the demand for testing services with regard to faster speed microprocessor chips in southeast asia 
as a percentage of the total revenue  the revenue generated by the distribution segment in fiscal accounted for only  a decrease of  compared to in fiscal in terms of dollar amount  revenue for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  compared to  for fiscal the contributing factors behind this drop were lower demand for back end products such as vibration equipment and chambers in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  a saturation of equipment and electronic components in the current market  and continued conservative spending on capital equipment by many companies 
we continued to focus our marketing efforts on asia  as we believe that the recovery of equipment sales in that region is improving more rapidly than sales within the us equipment sales in the us continue to decline as many companies are still conservative in capital equipment spending 
the distribution operation located in singapore will focus on selling wet process stations primarily to research institutions and local universities 
equipment and electronic component sales are very competitive  as the products are prevalent in the market 
thus  add value has been a key phrase in the mission statement of the distribution segment 
the backlog in the distribution segment at june  was  reflecting a decrease of or  compared to the backlog of  at june  due to a lower demand for back end products  such as vibration equipment  chambers and wafer fabricator 
overall gross margin overall gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  improved by from for fiscal to for fiscal in terms of dollar amount  gross margin for fiscal was  an increase of  or  compared to  for fiscal the increase in overall gross margin was due to the decrease of material costs in the manufacturing segment  and better utilization of testing facilities in the testing segment  offset by the decline of gross margin in the distribution segment due to lower margin back end products 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the manufacturing segment was improved by  from in fiscal to in fiscal in terms of dollar amount  gross margin in the manufacturing segment in fiscal was  an increase of  or  compared to  in fiscal the increase in gross margin was mainly due to lower material cost incurred 
the reduction in material cost was the result of our cost reduction plan  under which portion of the manufacturing process was outsourced to cost effective  competitive vendors 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the testing segment was improved by  from in fiscal to in fiscal however  in terms of dollar amount  gross margin in the testing segment for fiscal was increased by to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the increase in gross margin was consistent with the increase in revenue 
our testing facilities require substantial investment to be built and significant portions of our operating costs are fixed in nature 
in general  these costs do not decline along with reductions in customer demand or the utilization of our testing capacity  which in turn can adversely affect our profit margin 
conversely  as product demand rises and facility utilization increases  the fixed costs are spread over the increased output  which improve our profit margins 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenue in the distribution segment  was decreased by from for fiscal to for fiscal in terms of dollar amount  gross margin in the distribution segment in fiscal was  a decrease of  or  compared to in fiscal the decline in gross margin was because the revenue in the distribution segment for fiscal was primarily generated from low margin back end products 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively  were as follows in thousands general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss loss on disposal of pp e general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal due to an increase of in payroll expenses as a result of a larger headcount to handle the rise in sales volume  an increase of in provision for doubtful debts  and an increase of in general and administration expenses 
directors and officers bonuses increased by as a result of the gain related primarily to the sale of the ireland property 
these bonuses were granted based primarily on a percentage of our pre tax profits for fiscal  which is consistent with our long standing compensation programs for directors and corporate officers 
with regard to the gain of the property located in dublin  ireland  the recipients agreed to take their bonuses based on after tax profits 
selling expenses decreased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal due to fewer net sales in the distribution segment  which had a commission basis 
research and development decreased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal due to less activity and fewer employee costs in the us operation 
impairment loss decreased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal due to fewer burn in equipment and machinery in singapore becoming obsolete 
the burn in equipment and machinery become obsolete as technology changes 
the impairment loss consisted of machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements pertaining to the singapore operations due to changes in demand for certain burn in services  which in turn made certain of our existing burn in facilities obsolete 
loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment increased by from fiscal to fiscal due to the disposal of certain fixed assets at a loss 
income from operations income from operations  as a percentage of total revenue  improved marginally by from for fiscal to for fiscal in terms of dollar amount  income from operations increased by  or  from for fiscal to for fiscal due to an increase in gross profit of  offset with a net increase in operating expenses of interest expense the interest expenses for fiscal years and were as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal interest expense interest expenses decreased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal due mainly to a lower usage of lines of credit 
however  this was offset by an increase in term loans in the singapore operation 
other income other income for fiscal years and was as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal other income other income increased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the increase in interest income generated from short term deposits and an increase in other items  but offset by the currency transactional loss 
interest income in fiscal was increased by due to short term deposits made using the proceeds from the sale of the property in dublin  ireland 
other items increased by which was mainly due to the reversing of a provision of in the fourth quarter  
table of contents related to the value added tax assessment incurred in our bangkok testing operations in fiscal the reversal was a result of the review conducted by the tax authority in thailand to comply with the tax regulation there 
also contributing to the increase of other items was the receipt of received from the ireland government due to redundant payments incurred in our former testing operations in ireland 
these were offset by a currency translation loss  which increased by from a current transactional gain of for fiscal income tax income tax provision increased by  or  from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily attributed to higher taxable income generated from the singapore location 
the singapore operations generated a profit of  in fiscal  up from  in fiscal the income tax amount included a provision for deferred tax liability of for the singapore operation and net of a deferred tax liability of for the bangkok operation as a result of the reversal of deferred tax assets provision from the prior year 
these were offset by net of a deferred tax assets provision of for the malaysia operation 
the effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease was due to the use of foreign tax credits and general business credits  offset by the dividend income in fiscal income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for fiscal was  which included a gain of  from the sale of property located in dublin  ireland offset by a loss of from discontinued operations 
net income net income for fiscal increased  over net income for fiscal net income was  in fiscal compared to for fiscal the main factor that contributed to the increase of  was the gain of  from the sale of property located in dublin  ireland 
the increase of in income from continuing operations was due to the increase of net sales and the increase of in other income 
the majority of the other income was from the reversal of a tax provision of in the fourth quarter  in accordance with instruction from the tax authority in thailand 
earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were in fiscal  an increase of 
basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were and  respectively  in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal  mainly due to income from discontinued operations derived from the sale of the dublin  ireland property 
segment information the revenue  gross margin and income from each segment for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are presented below 
as the segment revenue and gross margin for each segment have been discussed in the previous section  only the comparison of income from operations is discussed below 
manufacturing segment manufacturing segment in thousands fiscal fiscal revenue gross margin loss from operations loss from operations in the manufacturing segment decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement in operating loss was due to the increase of  in gross revenue in fiscal the cost of goods sold in the manufacturing segment as a percentage of sales by the segment also decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to lower material costs incurred 

table of contents testing segment testing segment in thousands fiscal fiscal revenue gross margin income from operations income from operations in the testing segment in fiscal was  an increase of  or  compared to in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the increase of  in gross margin previously discussed 
in addition  an increase in demand from one of our customers with regard to its high end personal computers  notebooks and server chips also contributed to the increase 
offsetting the positive increase was an increase of in operating expenses 
operating expenses in the testing segment were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in payroll and related expenses  as a result of the increase in headcount in singapore in fiscal distribution segment distribution segment in thousands fiscal fiscal revenue gross margin loss from operations loss from operations in the distribution segment increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in operating loss was attributable to a decrease in gross profit of  and offset by a decrease in operating expenses of the decline in gross margin was a result of the revenue primarily from low margin back end products in fiscal operating expenses were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses was attributable to lower selling expenses as the result of the decrease in sales 
corporate the loss income from operations for corporate for the third quarters of and were as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal income loss from operations corporate operating income decreased by to a loss of in fiscal from an income of in fiscal such a decrease in corporate income was attributable to higher director and corporate officer bonuses of incurred in fiscal  whereas the director and corporate officer bonuses were in fiscal 
table of contents comparison of fiscal and the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and overall net sales and gross margin net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss loss gain on disposal of pp e total operating expenses income from operations overall revenue the overall revenue is composed of the revenues from the manufacturing  testing and distribution segments 
the following table presents the components of the overall revenue realized in fiscal and in percentage format  respectively 
years ended june  revenues manufacturing testing distribution total net sales for fiscal were  increased by  or  compared to  for fiscal the increase in net sales can be discussed within the three segments 
as a percentage of the total revenue  the revenue generated by the manufacturing segment was increased by from fiscal to fiscal the increase was due in part to increased sales of burn in systems  which improved by with a increase in quantity sold and a drop in average unit selling price of  and increased sales of burn in boards by  a spike in quantity sold and a rise in average unit selling price 
some of our electronic device manufacturing customers increased their capital equipment in order to meet their increase in production capacity 
the personal computer market expanded in asia  leading to greater demand for electronic components 
the increase in sales of burn in boards derived from newly acquired customers in this region whom the company had been pursuing for some time 
however  these factors were offset by lower sales of artic temperature controlled chucks  environmental test equipment and wet process stations 
sales of artic temperature controlled chucks were dropped by from fiscal to fiscal  with a decrease of in quantity sold and an increase of in average unit selling price 
environmental test equipment sales weredeclined by from fiscal to fiscal  with a increase in quantity sold  but a decrease in the average unit selling price 
sales for both of these items were affected by cautious spending in the us due to inventory adjustments on capital equipment in the distribution channel  which in turn affected the manufacturing of equipment in the us operation 
sales of wet process stations of  from fiscal primarily came from universal systems 
this manufacturing operation in san jose  california was moved to singapore in fiscal due to high manufacturing costs in the us singapore distribution personnel were trained to manufacture wet process stations at that time 
during fiscal  a wet process station was delivered to the customer  but the company was unable to recognize the sale as it did not meet our revenue recognition policy sab 
therefore  no wet process stations were sold in fiscal as a percentage of the total revenue  the revenue generated by the testing segment was increased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal the bulk of the sales increase was in our newly acquired burn in operation in malaysia  which accounted for approximately of total burn in services 
although the singapore testing operation experienced a change in services mix  the high demand for testing of the new type of microprocessor chips was more than enough to make up for the drop in sales 
table of contents volume for testing of the slower speed microprocessor chips 
customers changed their requirements  which resulted in a lower average unit selling price for many of our products 
however  we expect to be compensated for this by the increase in burn in services demanded for the new  faster microprocessor chips 
the semiconductor market in thailand declined noticeably  and our operation in that region experienced a drop off in sales of to in fiscal as compared to sales of in fiscal as a percentage of the total revenue  the revenue generated by the distribution segment was decreased slightly by  or  from fiscal to fiscal however  the distribution segment had a significant change in sales mix 
higher margin test chambers  vibration equipment and other products increased in sales by in fiscal over fiscal  with a increase in quantity sold and a rise in average unit selling price 
this was mainly due to the semiconductor markets in taiwan and china  which grew strongly over that year 
the majority of our new customers had facilities set up in china and needed test equipment for their quality control 
hence  there was a hike in demand for vibration equipment and test chambers from customers in asia 
in addition  a new distribution operation was set up in singapore in fiscal to act as a distributor of electronic components for customers in the region  which also positively impacted sales 
sales of lower margin front end products were declined by from fiscal to fiscal  with a drop of in quantity sold and a decline of in average unit selling price 
the reason for this decrease was the decline in customer demand for these products in the us thus  the sales team shifted focus from lower margin front end products to marketing other  more profitable products 
sales of parts and services dropped from fiscal to fiscal as the company shifted its focus to training and testing on the manufacturing of wet process stations 
overall gross margin the overall gross margin declined slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the erosion in the margin was the result of a surge in sales for low margin burn in boards  which caused the group margin to slide compared to the previous fiscal year 
in addition  inventory totaling was written off in the us manufacturing operation due to obsolescence 
the decline in overall gross margin from the manufacturing segment was partially offset by increased margins in the testing and distribution segments  which were the result of many factors to be further explained 
the gross margin in the manufacturing segment was decreased by  even though sales increased by compared to fiscal the hike in sales of burn in boards was not enough to raise the overall gross margin  and the same was true for the hike in quantity sold of burn in systems  though their price had lowered 
however  the company wished to continue manufacturing low margin burn in boards in order to maintain market share 
sales by the manufacturing segment in the us dropped from  in fiscal to in  but the cost of sales  which included fixed and semi fixed costs  did not decrease proportionately due to the fact that the operation was already operating at minimal cost 
additionally  the us operation had to write off in inventory due to obsolescence the gross margin in the testing segment was increased by from fiscal to fiscal the improvement in the singapore testing operation increased the overall margin for this segment 
by upgrading the existing facilities in that region  the operation avoided incurring additional rental costs for the burn in services for the new chips and saved in terms of minimal renovation costs without incurring much depreciation 
however  further renovation will incur more costs 
with more efficient manpower scheduling  labor costs as a percentage of sales dropped from in fiscal to in fiscal  which also positively impacted the gross margin for this segment 
the increase in gross margin for the distribution segment was due to the substantial percentage increase in quantity and average unit selling price for test chambers and vibration equipment 
the increase in margin for test chambers and vibration equipment was able to negate the negative impact from decreased sales volume and selling prices of lower margin products and spare parts 
operating expenses the operating expenses for fiscal years and were as follows in thousands general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss loss gain on disposal of pp e 
table of contents as a percentage of sales  operating expenses decreased by from in fiscal to in fiscal this slight drop was attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the manufacturing segment 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were decreased by  from in fiscal to in fiscal this was primarily due to the sudden surge in sales of burn in boards and systems in the manufacturing segment  while at the same time  keeping operating expenses in this segment minimal 
on the other hand  in terms of dollar value  general and administrative expenses increased by compared to fiscal due to a number of factors 
salaries in the southeast asia region increased to accommodate the new testing operation in malaysia and the higher headcount needed in the singapore cost center to support operations in southeast asia 
bonus provisions in the amount of were incurred in due to better performance by the singapore testing and manufacturing operations personnel  whereas there was a reversal of bonuses in the amount of in due to unmet bonus criteria 
increased professional fees  such as an iso audit and outsourcing of accounting services  contributed to of the increase in the singapore and thailand operations 
depreciation costs from the thailand and malaysia operations increased by due to the addition of a building extension and facility renovations needed to accommodate new products 
furthermore  the company accrued in fiscal for an annual event  which was cancelled in fiscal we incurred higher bank charges of in the singapore operation for the renewal of a guarantee and an increase in insurance in the amount of for a new policy 
we incurred in the malaysia operation due to higher operating expenses such as printing and stationary  insurance  upkeep of office and non capitalized assets  as well as a higher provision for doubtful debts of  as the tenant in our malaysia facility defaulted on payment 
in the same operation was an overprovision for the cost of moving equipment in fiscal after the operation was scaled down 
we incurred an increase in amortization costs of for customer relation intangibles in the malaysia operation  and an increase of for legal matters pertaining to this newly acquired facility 
we also incurred fees of for consulting work on sox requirements and legal fees of for the newly acquired operation for sec disclosure purposes 
corporate officers traveled more in fiscal  increasing travel and entertainment costs by another in board fees were incurred due to an adjustment in directors compensation at the beginning of the fiscal year 
furthermore  there was a reversal of bonuses of in the us operation in fiscal due to unmet bonus criteria  whereas no such reversal occurred in finally  there was an increase in bad debts expense of in one of the us operations for irrecoverable debt and in miscellaneous costs 
however  all of these factors were somewhat offset by certain factors  such as a savings from the universal systems operation after it was relocated from san jose to singapore 
for the same reason there were savings of in equipment rental  in insurance and in audit fees 
also  there was lower headcount in the accounting department in the us  which lowered the salary expenditure by finally  there was in lowered audit fees  as the service for fiscal had not yet been performed 
the expenses incurred in the ireland operation were included in discontinued operations 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to the surge in the manufacturing sales  which offset an increase in headcount in distribution and higher commission and advertisement costs in singapore 
however  in terms of dollar value  selling expenses increased by from fiscal to fiscal due to several factors 
salaries increased by due to increased headcount for the expansion of the distribution operation in singapore 
the provision of warranty increased by and commissions increased by due to higher equipment sales in the manufacturing and distribution segments  respectively 
additionally  there was commission income in the distribution segment in the amount of in fiscal and none in fiscal finally  more in advertising costs were spent in order to procure new customers in singapore 
all these factors were somewhat offset by savings in salaries of sales personnel of  commission of and rental and utilities of as compared to fiscal  due to the relocation of the manufacturing operation from san jose to singapore 
additionally  some new customers of our malaysia and singapore operations were located in those same areas  therefore cutting travel expenses by research and development expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to less activity in the us operation 
the company had an impairment loss of in fiscal consisting of machinery and equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvement pertaining to the singapore testing operation 
due to the decrease in demand for the slower speed microprocessor chips  some of our existing burn in facilities assets became obsolete 
in contrast to fiscal  there was an impairment loss in the amount of there was a gain on disposal of fixed assets of in fiscal  derived primarily from the thailand operations  on sales of equipment and boards 
there was a minimal loss in fiscal on disposal of fixed assets 
income from operations income from operations as a percentage of sales was improved marginally by from fiscal to in absolute amount it went up from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the increase in gross profit of  but was offset with a net increase in operating expenses of  
table of contents interest expense the interest expenses for fiscal years and were as follows in thousands interest expense interest expense was increased by from fiscal to fiscal this was due to higher usage of credit by the singapore operations for the expansion of its facilities  thereby incurring higher interest expenses of the higher expenses were offset by a decrease in the interest from capital leases of and a decrease in miscellaneous expenses of other income other income for fiscal years and were as follows in thousands other income other income decreased by from fiscal to fiscal due to several factors 
there was a gain on marketable securities of after the malaysia subsidiary disposed of all investments and subsequently exited the market in fiscal  whereas there was no such transaction in fiscal furthermore  there was lower interest income of and lower dividend income of from the malaysia subsidiary 
there was an exchange gain of in the singapore and thailand operations 
finally  sundry income increased by income tax the total income tax provision was increased by  from a negative in fiscal to in fiscal of the change of  there was an increase in the current portion of foreign income tax of  from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was attributable mainly to the higher taxable income generated by our singapore operation 
the singapore operation generated a profit of in fiscal and a loss of in fiscal in addition  there was a tax provision of in the thailand operation based on taxable income of in fiscal this was lower compared to the tax provision of in fiscal based on taxable income of even though the malaysia operation suffered losses in fiscal  there were still certain minimal tax provisions incurred 
the increase in deferred income tax provision of which was incurred in fiscal was the difference between deferred tax liability solely in singapore of as of june  and as of june  comparing the deferred income tax benefit of for fiscal  the resulting change was  accounting for of the total change of aforementioned 
the increase in deferred tax liabilities was attributable mainly to the result of the timing differences related to the recording of depreciation expenses for book and tax purposes and estimated tax liability resulting from accumulated corporate expenses allocated from the us in the meantime  the company did not recognize any deferred income tax benefits related to net operating losses generated in the us management believes that it was more likely than not that these future benefit from these timing differences would not be realized 
accordingly  the company provided a full valuation on the estimated deferred tax assets 
the company s effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the higher effective income tax rate in fiscal was due mainly to the decrease in foreign tax rate reduction which was negative for fiscal compared to negative in fiscal the decrease in foreign tax rate reduction was the result of an increase in income tax provision in our subsidiaries outside the us for fiscal compared to the income tax provision in these subsidiaries for fiscal in addition  the change in valuation allowance to deferred tax assets in fiscal contributed compared to in fiscal finally  other permanent differences contributed in fiscal whereas there were none in fiscal the company files income tax returns in the us  singapore  thailand  and malaysia  respectively 
income taxes are provided in those countries where taxable income is earned 
income in one country is not offset by losses in another country 
accordingly  no benefit is provided for losses in the countries except where the loss can be carried back against income recognized in previous years 
in essence  the effect of providing tax provision against taxable income and providing no benefit for losses generated in the us results in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate 
net income net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately  which represented an increase of from a net income of for fiscal consequently  basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by to and from to respectively  in fiscal basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations decreased by to and from to  respectively 

table of contents segment information manufacturing segment the revenue  gross margin and loss from operations for the manufacturing segment for fiscal years and were as follows in thousands revenue gross margin loss from operations loss from operations went down from in fiscal to in fiscal the relocation of universal systems resulted in the reduction of certain fixed costs  such as in salaries  in office and equipment rental  in utilities and insurance costs  in commissions  and another in professional and audit fees 
the transferred operation is currently being operated by existing singapore personnel 
general and administrative expenses in the manufacturing segment as a percentage of sales by that segment dropped from in fiscal to in fiscal  while selling expenses as a percentage of sales dropped from to  mainly due to the increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal furthermore  the manufacturing operation in singapore managed the sales increase with its existing headcount while outsourcing some projects in order to maintain a lean workforce 
with this strategy  the operation was able to operate at lower overhead 
testing segment the revenue  gross margin and income from operation for the testing segment for fiscal years and were as follows in thousands revenue gross margin income from operations the testing segment experienced a increase in income from operations from fiscal to fiscal much of this improvement was due to higher gross profit 
some was the result of more efficient scheduling of manpower and the upgrading of some of our existing facilities to cater to the changing requirements of customers  which put us at a competitive edge and allowed us to generate greater profits 
despite higher general and administrative expenses in this segment  which increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  the gross profit was more than enough to offset the higher salaries  salary related expenses and additional costs for setting up the newly acquired burn in facility in malaysia 
distribution segment the revenue  gross margin and loss from operations for the distribution segment for fiscal years and were as follows in thousands revenue gross margin loss from operations operating income in the distribution segment dropped by from fiscal to fiscal this decline was mainly due to lower sales and greater selling expenses incurred in the singapore distribution operations

this training and testing required a fair amount of time and cost for these engineers  impacting the income from operation in this segment 
additionally  selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to increased commissions of in the singapore distribution operation as a result of an increase in sales of commissionable equipment 
this same operation had commissionable income of in fiscal but none in fiscal salaries in this segment were increased by due to the expansion of the distribution operation in singapore 
however  at the current level of sales as a distributor  the margin was not sufficient to cover the salary and rental costs 
we anticipate that the operation will continue to search for products with a higher margin

in august  we established a winding down plan to close the testing operation in dublin  ireland 
in late september  we entered into a definite sale and purchase agreement with a buyer through an auction process 
the sale was consummated on november  the gross proceeds were approximately  cost to sell was and capital gain tax on the disposal gain was  resulting in net proceeds of  the loss from discontinued operations of was deemed as cash outflow from operating activities of the discontinued operation 
consequently  the net proceeds provided by investing activities were  from the sale of the property  and the cash used in financing activities was the disbursement of to pay off the outstanding equipment loan 
the impact of this discontinued operation was immaterial because the total revenues for fiscal and fiscal were approximately and  respectively 
we believe that there will not be any future significant cash flows from the discontinued operation  as the outstanding accounts receivable and accounts payable are immaterial to our financial position and liquidity 
before moving out of ireland  we wired approximately  to our singapore subsidiary where the main operations are located 
on december   the board of directors of the company declared a cash dividend of fifty cents per share based on the shareholders of record on january  the total number of shares issued and outstanding as of january  was  and the total cash dividends paid on january  were  which dividends were paid out of the above  in addition  of the  was used for bonuses to the directors and corporate officers which were paid in december and january cash flows analysis comparison of fiscal and net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  compared to net cash of provided by operating activities for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was attributable to the following factors i the increase in net income  ii the increase in non cash items  iii the changes in operating assets and liabilities  and iv the cash inflow from accounts payables 
the net income from operating activities in fiscal increased by  to  from in fiscal however  the increase was caused by the sale of property of a discontinued operation in the amount of  the cash inflow from accounts payables increased by  to  in fiscal  compared to a cash outflow of in fiscal as a result of the increase in material purchases to support the sales backlog 
also offsetting the net cash was the cash outflow from accounts receivable of  which increased by  compared to a cash outflow of in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was  an increase of  or  compared to net cash of used in investing activities for fiscal compared to net cash of used in investing activities for fiscal  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was attributed to i the net proceeds from discontinued operation  which were  incurred in fiscal whereas there was no such proceeds in fiscal  ii a decrease in capital expenditures by  to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  iii an increase in proceeds of disposing equipment of in fiscal compared to proceeds of only in fiscal  iv a decrease in acquisition cost by to incurred in fiscal compared to  incurred in fiscal  and v proceeds of  used in investing in short term deposits in fiscal compared to net cash of  provided by net investment in short term deposits in fiscal net cash used in financing activities increased by  to  in fiscal from a cash inflow of in last fiscal year 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to more proceeds from long term debt of  as compared to  incurred to expand the operation in singapore  and proceeds of from stock options exercised compared to however  these were offset by i net repayments on the line of credit of

management believed that the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was consistent with the decrease in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was  reflecting a decrease of  compared to the net cash of  during fiscal the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was attributable mainly to the decrease in purchasing short term deposits in fiscal  as the proceeds from maturing short term deposits were used for capital expenditures and the acquisition of the business in malaysia  which activity did not take place in fiscal in fiscal  the proceeds from maturing short term deposits were less than the cash outflow to invest in short term deposits 
in contrast  the proceeds from maturing short term deposits in fiscal were much more than the proceeds in fiscal  though still not adequate to cover the investment in capital expenditures  short term deposits and the acquisition of the business in malaysia 
as all investments in marketable securities had been disposed of during fiscal  there were no such proceeds from selling investments in marketable securities during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was  reflecting an increase of compared to the net cash of in fiscal the increase was due mainly to the increase of in borrowings on lines of credit  and lower payments for debts and capital leases of during fiscal compared to net repayments of  for the year ended june  payments were higher in fiscal due to early repayment on a loan in singapore 
the increase in borrowing on lines of credit resulted in fewer proceeds from borrowing through long term debts  noting proceeds from long term debts of in fiscal compared to in fiscal furthermore  the increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to the repayment of on the outstanding lines of credit in fiscal  whereas there was no such cash outflow in fiscal approximately of short term deposits as of june  were held in the company s owned malaysian subsidiary

on january   we consummated the acquisition of testing operations in shanghai  china  as management believed that acquiring the burn in testing business in shanghai would enhance our future growth opportunities and develop our market share in the china testing service segment 
furthermore  as the volume of our manufacturing business located in van nuys  california has been gradually declining  we anticipate that the need for working capital to finance our us operations will decrease accordingly 
the majority of our capital expenditures are based on the demands from our customers  as we are in a capital intensive industry 
in the past three years  our capital expenditures ranged from million to million 
based on current client demands  management estimates that the capital expenditures in fiscal will range from million to million 
we believe that we are able to satisfy these future needs from the working capital and the lines of credit 
we paid down our lines of credit by to in fiscal compared to for fiscal however  trade payables increased from  at june  to  at june  due to increased sales 
as the backlog of the company soared in the last quarter of fiscal  we anticipate that our purchases of raw materials will increase in order to meet demand in the next few quarters
