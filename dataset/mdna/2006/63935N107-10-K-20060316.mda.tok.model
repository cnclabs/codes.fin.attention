the company seeks to retain its consultants by offering competitive packages of base and incentive compensation  equity ownership  and benefits 
independent contractors supplement the company s consultants on certain engagements 
the company has found that the practice of retaining independent contractors on a per engagement basis provides flexibility in adjusting professional personnel levels in response to changes in demand for the company s professional services 
in addition to the employees and independent contractors discussed above  the company has acquired and seeks to acquire consulting businesses to add both highly skilled professionals and enhance the services offered by the company

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
such factors could have a significant impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s inability to retain and  as necessary  strengthen our executive management team would be detrimental to the success of our business 
the company relies heavily on a small group of senior executives and retaining their services is important to our future success 
as the company continues to expand  the executive management will face increasing 
table of contents challenges and the possible need to supplement or expand the existing team  as well as a necessary succession plan 
any failures in this regard could impact  among other factors  the company s revenues  growth and profitability 
the company s inability to retain highly skilled consulting professionals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company relies heavily on its consulting staff and management team 
the company s success depends  in large part  on its ability to hire  retain  develop and motivate highly skilled professionals 
competition for these skilled professionals is intense and the company s inability to attract and retain adequate numbers of consultants and managers could have a serious effect on its ability to meet client needs 
a loss of a significant number of its employees could have a serious negative effect on the company 
the company s profitability will suffer if it is not able to maintain current pricing and utilization rates 
the company revenues  and thereby its profitability  is largely a function of the bill rates and the utilization rate of its professionals 
accordingly  if the company is not able to maintain the pricing for its services or an appropriate utilization rate for its professionals  revenues  project profit margins and the company s profitability will suffer 
pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and project profit margins 
bill rates and utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including management s ability to predict future demand for services and maintain the appropriate headcount without significant underutilized personnel  management s ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  the company s clients perceptions of its ability to add value through its services  the pricing of its competitor s services  the market demand for the services provided by the company  the company s ability to manage attrition rates  and management may not be able to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as the company increases the number of its professionals and executes its growth strategies 
the company s use of equity based compensation could impact its ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees  if the company s stock price declines 
any excessive volatility or decline in the common stock could impair the company s ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
compensation and retention related issues represent a continuing challenge for the company 
the company faces significant challenges in achieving and managing growth 
failure to meet these management challenges could have a material adverse effect on the future profitability of the company 
the increased scale and complexity of the company s businesses may require additional management systems that the company may not be able to implement in a timely manner 
the challenges of achieving and managing sustained growth may cause strain on the company s management team and the company s systems 
if the company is unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  this may impair the company s financial results  competitive position and ability to retain its professionals 
the company may be exposed to potential risks if the company is unable to maintain effective internal controls 
if the company fails to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting or fails to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting 
table of contents and preparation of our financial statements for external use  the company may fail to meet its public reporting requirements on a timely basis  or be unable to adequately report on its business and the results of operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s stock 
finally  the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud  regardless of the adequacy of those controls 
regulatory and legislative changes affecting the company  its clients  competitors  or staff could have an impact on the company s business 
many of the company s clients are in highly regulated industries such as the healthcare  energy  financial institutions and insurance industries 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries  including asbestos reform litigation  could impact the market for the company s service offerings and could render its current service offerings obsolete 
in addition  regulatory and legislative changes could impact the competition for consulting services 
this change could have either increase or decrease the company s competitive position compared with the company s competitors 
the company s client engagements are generally short term in nature  less than one year  and may be terminated 
the company s inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s inability to continually replace a significant portion of current engagements with new engagements would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its current and future commitments 
many of the client engagement agreements can be terminated by the company s clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation is settled  our engagement for those services usually is no longer necessary and is promptly terminated 
the company also is retained by clients where the work involves multiple engagements or stages 
in such engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain the company for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
the company s engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to its office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
additionally  the above mentioned factors limit the company s ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing 
if the company inaccurately predicts its future revenues  this can impact its financial results 
the company s client engagements and revenues are frequently event driven and therefore difficult to forecast 
the company markets its services as assisting companies and their legal counsel in addressing the challenges of uncertainty and risk  and leveraging opportunities for overall business improvement 
in the past  the company has derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of  and hurricane katrina 
such events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for such challenges 
these factors limit the company s ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing 
if the company inaccurately predicts its future revenues  this can impact its financial results 
the company has invested in specialized systems  processes and intellectual capital for which the company may fail to recover its investment or which may become obsolete 
specialized systems and processes have been developed by the company and provide a competitive advantage in serving current clients and obtaining new clients 
additionally  many of the company s service offerings rely on technology that is subject to rapid change 
the company s intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 

table of contents the company s unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to its professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the professional reputation of the company and its consultants is critical to the company s ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage the company s professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company s engagements are subject to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that the company s services were negligent or that the company breached any of its obligations to a client could expose the company to significant legal liabilities  could distract its management and could damage its reputation 
the company carries professional liability insurance  but such insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from the company s engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover a particular claim  a group of claims  and the costs of defense 
some of the work that the company does involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
the company does work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while the company attempts to identify such higher risk engagements and higher risk clients in time to avoid unnecessary risks or to limit our potential exposure  these efforts may be ineffective and a professional error or omission in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
examples of such higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  usually in hospitals and other healthcare providers  expert witness engagements  corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  fairness opinions  compliance effectiveness opinions  actuarial opinions with respect to insurance company loss reserves  estimates of asbestos related and other mass tort insurance recoveries for financial reporting purposes by public companies and other clients  and independent consultant s reports in support of bond financings 
as the company becomes larger  the company increasingly encounter professional conflicts of interest 
as independent consultants  the company generally does not have duties of undivided loyalty to specific clients 
however  if the company is unable to accept new engagements for any reason  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations for future periods and may also create challenges for the company in retaining such consultants 
in addition  although the company has systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts prior to accepting each new engagement  those systems are not fool proof and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and professional liability 
the company cannot be certain that it will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to execute future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs 
the company maintains a revolving line of credit agreement to assist in funding short term and long term cash requirements from normal operations 
this agreement contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  a minimum level of earnings 
poor performance of the company could cause the company to be in default of these existing covenants 
in addition  the current agreement may not be sufficient to meet the future needs of the business if a decline in financial performance occurs 

table of contents if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectability would likely be required 
the company may not be able to acquire businesses in the future and already acquired business may not achieve expected results 
the company may fail to achieve a return of its capital on certain business acquisitions 
the financing of these acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
the substantial majority of the purchase price the company pays for acquired businesses is related to intangible assets and the value of these assets may not be realized 
the acquired business culture may not integrate into the company s culture 
the company may not achieve synergies sought in certain acquisitions 
the acquired businesses clients and employees may not transfer to the company 
any of these issues caoul have a material adverse effect on the company 
as the company s work with governmental clients increases  this increases the risks inherent in the governmental contracting process 
the company does work for various municipal  state and federal entities and agencies 
these projects have risks that include  but are not limited to the following government entities reserve the right to audit the company s contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of the company s business practices with respect to government contracts 
if the government finds that the costs are not reimbursable then the company will not be allowed to bill for them  or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to the company 
findings from such an audit also may result in being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work and affect future margins 
if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  the company may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities  regardless of their adequacy 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of its accuracy  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only business with the particular government agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company is subject to unpredictable risks of litigation 
reference is made to the discussion of the city of vernon arbitration in item  legal proceedings 
although the company s policy is to avoid litigation whenever possible  from time to time the company is party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
such disputes may arise  for example  from client engagements  employment issues  regulatory actions  corporate acquisitions  real estate and other business transactions 
the costs and outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and may be worse than we can foresee 
as stated in item  an adverse award in the city of vernon arbitration could have a material adverse effect on the company

as previously disclosed  on february   the company received an adverse order and interim findings from an arbitrator in a proceeding related to a dispute with the city of vernon  california 
under a contract signed in  rmi us  a subsidiary of the company  provided electric distribution system maintenance services to the city until november   at which time the contract was terminated at the request of rmi us 
since that time  the company no longer provides such system maintenance services 
the arbitrator s order and interim findings denied the company s right to recover unpaid fees and expenses previously billed to the city 
as a result  the company charged million to expense in the company s fourth quarter consolidated statement of income 
in addition  the arbitrator found that  as a result of the suspension of the subsidiary s contractor s license for certain periods  rmi us did not meet the statutory definition of substantial compliance with licensing requirements and  therefore  the city is entitled to disgorgement of unspecified amounts paid under the contract for a period not defined in the order 
the arbitrator also found that the city is entitled to treble damages but the order did not indicate the amount of damages that would be trebled 
while the order does not state the amounts to be reimbursed or trebled  if the arbitrator enters a final award on the basis of the interim findings  and if that final award is not modified or reversed by the special arbitration appeal panel described below  the total amount could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in its briefs and arguments  the city has contended that an amount between million and million that it paid under the contract is subject to disgorgement due to rmi us alleged failure to be in substantial compliance with the state s licensing requirements 
in addition to its disgorgement claim  the city 
table of contents has also contended that the company s submission of bills under an earlier contract during to and for approximately days in represented false claims under the california false claims act with respect to which the city is entitled to collect approximately million in purported damages  trebled 
on march  the company filed briefs setting forth various legal and factual arguments that have yet to be considered by the arbitrator 
for the reasons stated in its briefs  the company contends the total amount that should be disgorged is zero and  in any event  substantially less than the amounts sought by the city 
further  the company contends that there was no violation of the california false claims act and treble damages are not appropriate 
in addition  the company is asserting various defenses  including the statute of limitations  which have not previously been ruled upon 
the arbitrator has established a briefing schedule to address any issues the company wishes to raise with respect to the order and interim findings and has scheduled a further hearing for argument in may the company strongly disagrees with the arbitrator s interim findings 
pursuant to a written stipulation of the parties  the company has the right to appeal any arbitration award to a three judge panel consisting of three neutral members agreed upon by the parties or appointed by the arbitration agency 
the appeal panel will apply the same standard of review that a first level appellate court in california would apply to an appeal from a trial court decision 
as previously disclosed  also at issue in the arbitration is whether rmi us must reimburse the city for approximately  in oil spill cleanup expenses incurred by the city 
the oil spill occurred in at the city s generating station  allegedly due to the negligence of rmi us and a subcontractor who removed certain underground piping at the request of the city 
the company contends that the oil spill was caused by the negligence of the city s employees 
evidentiary hearings were held in february and are expected to be completed in march  following which the arbitrator will issue his findings on the oil spill issues 
it is not possible at this point to reasonably predict the outcome of these proceedings  nor is it possible to reasonably estimate the loss or range thereof 
as such  no amounts have been reflected in the financial statements for the potential loss  if any  regarding this matter  other than the aforementioned charge of million relating to unpaid fees and expenses 
from time to time  the company is party to various other lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  except as otherwise described above  the company does not believe that any of those additional lawsuits or claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation of the company

critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues as the related professional services are provided 
in connection with recording revenues  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenues to cash 
the company may provide multiple services under the term of an arrangement 
these services have been considered as one unit of accounting under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
there are also client engagements where the company is paid a fixed amount for its services 
the recording of these fixed revenue amounts requires the company to make an estimate of the total amount of work to be performed and revenues are then recognized on a percentage of completion basis or based on objectively determinable output measures 
for these engagements  the company determines the most systematic and rational method of recognizing revenues 
the company applies a cost to cost approach  a methodology based upon objectively determined output measures  or a straight line method over the term of the arrangement  which is used if no other revenue recognition method is determined to be more systematic and rational 
from time to time  the company also earns incremental revenues 
these incremental revenue amounts are generally contingent on a specific event and the incremental revenues are recognized when the contingencies are resolved 
determination of accounts receivable realization the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated reduction  if any  in amounts to be received  based on the company s review and assessment of its clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by the company of amounts due from its clients
