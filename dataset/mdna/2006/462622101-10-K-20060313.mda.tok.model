item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ipsco is a north american mini mill steel manufacturer  steel pipe producer  and scrap processor  with facilities in several locations throughout canada and the united states 
our major products are hot rolled discrete plate and coil  heat treated plate  cut to length plate  finished tubular products and processed scrap metal 
we operate as a single business segment 
our tubular and cut to length products are produced primarily with our own coil  which allows us to capture increased margins on our steel products 
in favorable market conditions  we purchase additional coil from third party vendors in order to optimize utilization at all our facilities 
our customers  located primarily in the united states and canada  are in the service center  distribution  energy  agricultural equipment  transportation equipment  heavy machinery and construction industry sectors 
two thirds of our sales are made to us customers 
over the past four years  our sales have increased from million in to billion in average sales price per ton has increased from per ton in to per ton in total tons sold has increased from  tons in to  tons in this growth has been generated through expansion of our assets and product line sales into us markets 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue of billion in was an increase of million  or  over  resulting from significantly higher year over year prices in all product lines 
ipsco s average unit selling price  inclusive of raw material surcharges  increased to per ton in from per ton in ipsco s average unit selling price for steel mill products increased per ton to per ton  a increase over the per ton average price last year 
ipsco s average unit selling price for tubular products increased or per ton to  per ton 
cost of sales increased to billion compared to billion in factors that impacted cost of sales in were increases in the price of natural gas  electricity  alloy inputs and freight  as well as unabsorbed fixed costs and direct expenses relating to unplanned maintenance outages and safety evacuations in mobile due to the hurricanes in the gulf coast region 
gross margins were of sales versus in  reflecting a higher energy tubular product mix  as well as higher average pricing for the year in most products  which offset previously referenced increases in input costs 
in  a total of billion was spent on major raw materials and consumables for ipsco s three steelworks  comparable with the spending in included in this amount are expenditures for steel scrap  pig iron  alloys  carbon electrodes  oxygen  refractories  limestone  natural gas  and electricity 
the procurement of ferrous scrap  our largest input  is on a monthly cycle largely through the spot market 
during  ipsco purchased million tons of scrap  less than the prior year as high year end inventory levels were consumed in for  the average cost of scrap consumed declined 
despite the production increase of  these two factors helped keep costs of consumables comparable to the prior year 
scrap consumption costs dropped through the third quarter but increased in fourth quarter 
ipsco s internally sourced scrap provided of ipsco s overall needs 
sourcing for the remainder or our scrap needs was readily available 
energy inputs constitute a significant portion of an electric furnace steel maker s costs 
in  ipsco s electricity cost per kilowatt hour increased and cost per ton of steel produced increased by compared to natural gas costs per millions of british thermal units btu increased 
although these increases in energy were significant compared to  energy as a percentage of cost of production was compared to in amortization of capital assets decreased to million in from million in shipments the following table details tons shipped in thousands by major product line 
discrete plate and coil cut plate steel mill products energy tubular non energy tubular large diameter pipe tubular products total higher energy tubular shipments related to high drilling rates partially offset declines in steel mill product and non energy tubular shipments 
steel mill product shipments declined due to the previously mentioned outages and a temporary midyear decline in service center order rates 
shipments to us customers were  tons  of the total compared to  tons in  while canadian based customers accounted for  tons  or in versus  in ipsco s coil processing facilities in houston  st 
paul  and toronto  all make temper leveled cut plate products 
shipments of cut plate from coil processing facilities were  tons  down from canadian destined shipments decreased compared to levels  while us shipments declined 
shipments of cut plate declined in canada primarily by choice as ipsco diverted production to energy tubular goods 
energy tubular product sales increased or  tons due to stronger oil and gas drilling activity 
the average number of active drilling rigs increased on a year over year basis from  to  in the united states and increased from to in canada for a combined increase of 
shipments of non energy tubular decreased from  to  or  as ipsco dedicated more production capacity to energy tubular products 
production capacity utilization is a key driver of performance for ipsco 
output tonnage is in part a function of the number of production turns at each facility 
theoretically  all production equipment is available for hours a week  less operating downtime for routine maintenance 
therefore  to maximize plant and equipment utilization and minimize absorbed cost per ton of output  optimum cost performance occurs when four crews run the facilities around the clock 
optimum utilization after routine maintenance is about 
capacity  utilization and production  by facilities  is illustrated in the following table utilization production tons facility capacity tons regina montpelier mobile coil processing small diameter large diameter in thousands of tons of finished product 
in thousands of tons  based upon liquid steel for steelworks and finished products for other facilities 
total production tons increased in at both our regina and montpelier facilities  but decreased in mobile due to outages resulting from maintenance and hurricane evacuations previously mentioned 
finished production a total of  tons of coil were produced by ipsco s steelworks  down from ipsco s steelworks produced  tons of discrete plate  an increase of over regina and montpelier posted production increases in finished product year over year 
ipsco s coil processing and tubular operations consumed  tons of hot rolled coil purchased from third parties  supplementing ipsco s own production 
this was more than the  tons consumed a year earlier 
the principal reason for the increase was higher demand for energy tubular products 
the number of man hours required to produce a ton of coil or discrete plate averaged for the combined steelworks 
ipsco pipe mills produced more tons than a year earlier due to the impact of higher drilling activity on demand for octg 
the man hours required to convert finished steel to one ton of finished pipe averaged  up from man hours in man hours per ton increased in as we added finishing capabilities at our red deer and blytheville facilities which were previously outsourced 
the large diameter mills in regina experienced a utilization rate in versus the prior year 
selling  general and administration expense selling  general and administrative expenses of million were higher than the million expenses for salaries and benefits increases of million were primarily related to the valuation of stock based compensation as well as performance incentives 
during the year  ipsco incurred million of additional administrative and consulting expenses related to section of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  consulting expenses  research efforts related to the frontier pipe research centre  and increased charitable contributions increased administrative expenses by over million 
interest on long term debt interest expense on long term debt decreased to million in  down or million from the reduction relates to a significant reduction in long term debt through scheduled repayments  redemptions  and open market purchases 
during  million of long term debt was retired  primarily through early retirement and open market purchases 
the debt redemption efforts resulted in debt extinguishment expense of million 
income before taxes  income tax expense income before income taxes increased million to million in as a result of the favorable commercial and operating performance previously described 
income tax expense totaled million in  up over the million reported in the effective tax rate was compared to in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue of billion in was an increase of billion over and resulted from significantly higher year over year base prices in all product lines  higher volumes of steel mill and tubular product shipments  and raw material surcharges of million 
higher sales of energy tubular products resulted from increased drilling activity in the united states and canada and the completion of two major large diameter projects  cheyenne plains and the east texas expansion 
the stronger canadian dollar also increased reported sales by million over cost of sales increased to billion compared to billion in higher scrap costs were basically offset by surcharges 
however  increases in gas  electricity and alloy prices were absorbed in margins 
higher production rates at our us steelworks and tubular facilities helped to limit the margin impact of other input cost increases through volume efficiencies 
gross margins were of sales versus in  reflecting a favorable product mix and the significant price increases in all products  which offset higher input costs 
ipsco s average unit selling price  including raw material surcharges  increased to per ton in from per ton in the average base price excluding surcharge in was per ton  higher than the average in ipsco s average unit selling price for steel mill products increased per ton to per ton  a increase over the per ton average price last year 
the average per ton steel product surcharge contributed per ton to this increase 
the average base price increase of per ton is attributed to strong demand  favorable market conditions and a shift to more value added products 
ipsco s average unit selling price for tubular products increased or to per ton 
in  a total of billion was spent on major raw materials and consumables for ipsco s three steelworks  up by over the million spent in included in this amount are expenditures for steel scrap  pig iron  alloys  carbon electrodes  oxygen  refractories  limestone  natural gas  and electricity 
the procurement of ferrous scrap  our largest input  is on a monthly cycle largely through the spot market 
during  ipsco purchased million tons of scrap  more than the prior year 
for the average cost of scrap consumed increased 
although the price was volatile during the year  each quarterly average showed increases over the prior quarter 
ipsco s internally sourced scrap provided of ipsco s overall needs 
the remainder was readily available  although at increased prices  from other parties 
energy inputs constitute a significant portion of an electric furnace steel maker s costs 
in  ipsco s cost per kilowatt hour increased compared to however  higher utilization rates and savings realized through improved practices offset this increase and average cost per ton related to electricity actually declined 
natural gas costs per millions of btu s increased by about 
these natural gas increases were partially offset by higher utilization rates as average cost per ton produced increased 
maintenance is another important cost factor for steel production facilities 
effective april   we changed our method of accounting for the costs of major overhauls and repairs 
under the new method  the cost of major overhauls and repairs  which are not capitalized  are expensed as incurred 
previously  the non capital estimated cost of such repairs was accrued on a straight line basis with actual costs charged to the accrual as incurred 
therefore  the new method more appropriately recognizes such costs in the period incurred 
all periods addressed in this md a have been restated to reflect this change  which resulted in an increase to net income of million and million in and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements filed herewith for additional information 
amortization of capital assets increased by to million in from million in on january   we changed our estimate of the useful life of certain major machinery and equipment from to years 
this change has been applied prospectively and the effect on expense was million 
the remainder of the year over year change is related to capital asset additions during the years 
shipments for the eighth consecutive year  ipsco s shipments achieved record levels of  tons  or more than a year earlier 
shipments to us customers were  tons  of the total 
shipments to canadian customers accounted for  tons  or of the total 
shipments of  tons of discrete plate  cut plate and hot rolled coil steel mill products were higher than a year earlier 
tons sold in the united states increased by  while canadian tons increased by 
ipsco s coil processing facilities in houston  st 
paul  and toronto  all make temper leveled plate products 
shipments from coil processing facilities were  tons  comparable to the previous year 
canadian destined shipments increased compared to levels while us shipments declined 
ipsco produces tubular products  primarily from our own coil  at six locations 
by adding value to the basic steel mill product  profitability is enhanced 
about  or  tons  of ipsco s total shipments in were tubular products  and higher than tubular shipments 
shipments to us customers increased while shipments to canadian customers increased 
energy tubular product sales increased or  tons due to stronger oil and gas drilling activity 
the average number of active drilling rigs increased on a year over year basis from  to  in the united states and decreased from to in canada for a combined increase of 
total shipments of large diameter pipe increased to  tons from  tons due to the successful completion of the diameter cheyenne plains and east texas expansion projects in shipments of non energy tubulars increased from  to  or due to increased commercial demand and market penetration in the united states 
production production at the regina steelworks was  liquid tons in  which was essentially flat compared to the prior year 
the montpelier steelworks recorded production of  liquid tons of steel  compared to  tons in  an increase of 
the mobile steelworks produced  tons of liquid steel in versus  tons in  a fourth consecutive annual production increase 
a total of  tons of coil were produced by ipsco s steelworks  up from  reflecting primarily the increased demand generated by our tubular products 
ipsco s steelworks produced  tons of discrete plate  an increase of over all three steelworks posted production increases in finished product year over year 
large diameter utilization increased to as production for the east texas expansion continued through september ipsco s coil processing and tubular operations consumed  tons of hot rolled coil purchased from third parties  supplementing ipsco s own production 
this was more than the  tons consumed a year earlier 
the principal reason for the increase was higher demand for energy tubular products 
the number of man hours required to produce a ton of coil or discrete plate averaged for the combined steelworks 
ipsco pipe mills produced more tons than a year earlier due to the impact of higher drilling activity on demand for octg 
the man hours required to convert finished steel to one ton of finished pipe averaged  down from man hours in production of large diameter gas transmission pipe was  tons higher in reflecting the production and shipment of the cheyenne plains and east texas large diameter projects 
selling  general and administration expense selling  general and administrative expenses of million were higher than the million expenses for about million of the increase resulted from the stronger canadian dollar 
salaries and wages increased by million relating to merit increases  stock based compensation and performance incentives 
interest on long term debt interest expense on long term debt increased to million in  up or million over income before taxes  net income attributable to common shareholders income before income taxes increased million to million in as a result of the favorable commercial and operating performance described in the previous sections 
income tax expense totaled million in  up over the million reported in the effective tax rate was reduced from to as the strength of us results allowed ipsco to reverse its valuation allowance against tax benefits booked prior to see note to the consolidated financial statements filed herewith for further discussion 
net income increased by million from the million recorded in the net income available to common shareholders was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in off balance sheet arrangements the houston cut to length facility temper mill sale and leaseback was completed in the arranger was lasalle national leasing corporation and net proceeds received were million through two tranches of million on july  and million on september  ipsco has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase the leased equipment after seven years at million or years at the greater of million or fair market value 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements ipsco has ongoing commitments under various contractual and commercial obligations at december   as shown below 
the information presented does not include planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations payments due by period millions contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years long term debt interest leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations long term debt including current portion amount millions interest rate due loan june  financing november  financing may  notes june  capital lease october  total long term debt is all unsecured and consists of various notes  debentures and financing issued since the solid waste disposal revenue bonds  series  due  as well as the taxable industrial development revenue bonds  series  due are both subject to financial test covenants and to certain customary covenants including limitations on liens and sale and leasebacks 
the financing and the notes  and capital lease are not subject to any financial test covenants 
the notes  however  contain restrictions and limitations on liens  and sales and leasebacks 
non compliance with any of the above covenants could result in accelerated payment of the related debt 
ipsco was in compliance with all covenants on december  the montpelier steelworks sale and leaseback of the melt shop  caster and related equipment was completed in for us gaap purposes  this transaction was recorded as a financing lease  with no recognition of the disposal of the assets 
for canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap purposes  this transaction was treated as a sale and the subsequent lease payments as operating expenses 
ipsco has an option  but is not obligated  to purchase the equipment after seven and ten years for predetermined amounts and at the end of the lease term for the fair market value of the equipment  subject to a residual guarantee of million

sources and uses of cash cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in cash provided from operations before changes in working capital was million in  an increase of million over  reflecting higher gross income 
the change in working capital was a use of million  a decrease of million from the use of cash for working capital was attributable to higher receivables related to increased sales  higher unit costs as well as units of inventories compared to the prior year  and reduction of income taxes payable 
cash used in financing activities was million in compared to a use of cash of million in during  ipsco redeemed all million of its series b senior notes  purchased for cancellation on the open market  million of the unsecured notes due june  and retired all cdn million of the canadian debentures due december  in march  the company announced the share repurchase program  or normal course issuer bid  to repurchase up to million of the ipsco s common shares 
under the program  shares are repurchased in the open market at the market price at the time of purchase and are immediately cancelled upon settlement 
during  the company repurchased  shares for a total of us million 
in  ipsco retired its preferred shares for million and junior subordinated notes were redeemed for million 
interest paid on the junior subordinated notes in amounted to million 
ipsco s canadian defined benefit plans are made up of both qualified and unqualified plans for our employees  including executives 
the funded status of the qualified plans increased to at year end from at year end the company contributed a total of million to the plans during the year and million in this included additional funding to the qualified pension plans of million in and million in over that required by government regulations 
this funding offset the effects of a lower assumed discount rate on the projected benefit obligation 
the unqualified supplementary pension plan for our executives is not funded until due 
dividends to holders of common shares were million in compared to million the prior year  resulting from an increase in the annual dividend of cdn per share  the change in common shares outstanding due to shares issued pursuant to our share option plan and repurchases made pursuant to the normal course issuer bid  as well as the strength of the canadian dollar year over year 
cash received for shares that were issued as a result of the exercise of  options was million in versus million in for  options 
as of december   there were  common shares issued and outstanding 
capital investments total capital expenditures for net of the litigation settlement were million  an increase of million over spending in included in this year s expenditures were million for the mobile heat treat facility 
carry forward expenditures in from projects previously commenced will be approximately million 
included in was million for the exercise of an early buyout option on an operating lease 
liquidity the principal indicators of ipsco s liquidity are its cash position and amounts available under its bank line of credit revolving term facility 
on november   ipsco replaced its committed revolving term facility of million expiring march  with a committed revolving term facility of million expiring november  
as of december   letters of credit of million were outstanding against the revolving term facility resulting in million available for use 
the revolving term facility provides for unsecured advances 
the amount available is the total committed amount less direct borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
the facility has financial covenants with which ipsco must comply 
principal financial covenants under the revolving term facility require that consolidated debt less unrestricted cash to consolidated total capitalization shall not exceed prior to june   prior to december  and thereafter tangible net worth shall exceed million plus of net income after june  current assets to current liabilities shall be greater than free cash flow to fixed charges shall exceed for the period up to and including september   and thereafter the revolving term facility is also subject to other customary covenants and events of default 
non compliance with any of the above covenants could result in accelerated payment of the related debt and termination of the revolving term facility 
ipsco was in compliance with all covenants at december  during  ipsco s cash position increased by million to million while the working capital ratio increased from to at december   the committed cost to complete in process capital projects was million 
at the end of  this amount was million 
ipsco expects that it will be able to finance future expenditures from its cash position  cash from operations  and the revolving term facility 
we may also consider operating lease financing as well as additional debt or equity financing as may be appropriate 
from time to time  ipsco makes use of foreign currency contracts to manage ipsco s foreign exchange risks 
at december  there were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
ipsco has entered into swap agreements to hedge the cost of purchasing natural gas through october  as at december   the unrealized gain under these contracts was million compared to an unrealized gain of million at the end of debt ratings ipsco maintains debt ratings with three of north america s principal rating agencies to comply with various debt covenants 
moody s investor service s rating was upgraded to a baa with a stable outlook from ba with a positive outlook  on february  obligations rated baa are rated as being subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium grade  and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics 
the modifier indicates that the obligation ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category 
stable defines moody s rating direction over the medium term 
the corporate family rating also baa stable was withdrawn on february   as the company is now an investment grade issuer 
standard poor s rating s services rating was upgraded to a bb stable on july  an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues 
however  it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the modifier indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category 
stable means that the rating is not likely to change 
dominion bond rating service dbrs maintained its bbb low with a stable outlook rating during throughout long term debt rated bbb is of adequate credit quality 
protection of interest and principal is considered acceptable  but the entity is fairly susceptible to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions  or there may be other adverse conditions present which reduce the strength of the entity and its rated securities 
low means the overall strength and outlook for key liquidity  debt  and profitability ratios is not normally as favorable as with higher rating categories  but these considerations are still respectable 
capital structure ipsco strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and a flexible capital structure 
ipsco has the ability to  and may elect to  use a portion of cash and cash equivalents to retire debt or to incur additional expenditures without increasing debt 
ipsco considers its capital structure as of december  to be current portion of long term debt million long term debt million debt million shareholders equity  million total capitalization  million debt to total capitalization cash and cash equivalents million debt to total capitalization was at december   down from at december  in october  as part of regular reviews of the dividend level on common shares  ipsco s board of directors approved a doubling of the quarterly cash dividend to cdn per share

the us canadian gaap differences generally relate to timing issues for expense recognition 
the differences in the reported results arising from using us as opposed to canadian gaap are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in  we changed the preparation of our financial statements to conform to us gaap from canadian gaap 
our significant accounting polices are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these policies requires important judgments or estimations that can affect financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe the accounting principles chosen are appropriate under the circumstances  and that the estimates  judgments and assumptions involved in our financial reporting are reasonable 
accounting estimates made by management are based on an analysis of historical experience and information on current events that are available to management at the time the estimate is made 
if circumstances on which estimates were based change  the impact is included in the results of operations for the period in which the change occurs 
critical accounting policies that are subject to significant estimates and assumptions are summarized below 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
factors that could affect our estimate of undiscounted cash flows include  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes in operating performance  resulting in the need to write down those assets to fair value 
allowance for doubtful accounts ipsco has established an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the potential risk that some customers may be unable to make payments 
we continually monitor payment patterns of customers  investigate past due accounts to assess likelihood of collection and monitor industry and economic trends to estimate required allowances 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value 
every month we perform an analysis to determine whether any reduction in the average cost of inventory is necessary to record inventory at the lowest value 
in addition  an analysis is regularly performed to determine whether saleable products on hand need to be written down to reflect their estimated net realizable value given the intended sales channel for the product 
write downs to secondary grade are recognized based on this analysis 
if the products do not achieve this lower net realizable value  further losses in their disposition would be recognized 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the company estimates its actual current tax exposure in accordance with currently enacted tax laws and regulations 
in addition  it assesses temporary differences that exist due to differing treatments of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered  or settled 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
the company has tax filings that are subject to audit by the tax authorities that may result in additional tax assessments 
the resolution of these audits inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty 
any resulting change to its tax liability is therefore difficult to estimate 
numerous factors contribute to this uncertainty  including the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by tax authorities  the willingness of tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process and impartiality of the courts 
however limited  there exists the potential that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
the company has provided for taxes and interest that may ultimately be payable 
obligations relating to employee benefit plans ipsco provides retirement benefits for substantially all of our employees under several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans 
the defined benefit plans provide benefits that are based on a combination of years of service and an amount that is either fixed or based on final earnings 
the defined contribution plans restrict the company s matching contributions to of each participating employee s annual earnings 
our policy regarding the defined benefit plans is to fund the amount that is required by governing legislation 
periodically  the company may fund additional amounts depending on cash availability and other potential uses for the cash 
independent actuaries perform the required calculations to determine pension expense in accordance with gaap 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to the plans 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may affect the net pension expense and liability recorded 
the company benefit plans do not provide for post retirement health care benefits 
outlook ipsco s key product sectors of plate and energy tubular products continue to exhibit stable demand and sustained pricing levels 
the company believes that end user demand for steel mill products will remain relatively stable in we expect high oil and gas prices to continue to drive high rig counts and demand for octg products 
current forecasts are suggesting that drilling activity will increase over  which was a very strong year 
the large diameter pipe business will be at a higher level than that experienced in higher costs of steel making inputs will result in some margin compression in both plate and tubular product lines as these inventories flow through cost of goods sold 
we expect to invest approximately million of capital in our tubular and steelmaking facilities in to both maintain our production capabilities and increase our value added product mix 
our mobile plate heat treating facility commenced normalizing operations in december we are very pleased with the quality of product that the normalized facility is producing and are presently ahead of our start up plan for normalizing operations 
start up of the quench and temper line is expected to be delayed into the second quarter of concern as we enter rests primarily on the supply side with imports of hot rolled coil  plate  energy tubular and industrial pipe 
the difference between the north american market price for steel and pipe and market prices in other parts of the world  particularly the far east  make the united states and canada attractive markets for offshore suppliers 
imports have gained a serious foothold in the canadian plate market and in the us energy tubular market in particular 
this will be a focus for our business teams in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency risk and interest rate risk 
to manage the volatility related to these risks  we have entered into various derivative contracts  the majority of which are settled in cash 
such settlements have not had a significant effect on our liquidity in the past  nor are they expected to be significant in the future 
we do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
commodity price risk ipsco manages a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases by using derivative financial instruments 
the changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into production costs in the same period as the underlying transaction 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes million in unrealized net of tax gains for the fair value of these instruments 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that the reduction in the fair value of these instruments at december   due to hypothetical declines of and in market prices of natural gas at that time would be million and million  respectively december  million and million  respectively 
any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income  net of tax 
because these instruments are accounted for as hedges  these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle 
interest rate risk ipsco s outstanding debt is fixed rate debt and ipsco s investment practice is to invest in highly liquid money market funds or securities with short remaining maturities 
as a result  changes in interest rates are not expected to have a significant impact on the value of these investments 
as such  future changes in interest rates will not impact interest expense nor have any impact on the value of cash equivalent investments 
ipsco does not engage in interest swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
foreign currency risk ipsco is subject to the impact of changes in exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities including certain inter company balances  particularly changes in the value of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
at december   there were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding
