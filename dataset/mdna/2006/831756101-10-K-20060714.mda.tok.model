item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview highlights our fiscal net product and services sales of approximately million represented an increase of over fiscal firearms sales of approximately million  our core business  increased by 
net income in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal there were a number of initiatives that took place in fiscal that contributed to this improvement in results  including the following we introduced our m p pistol series 
this polymer frame pistol was designed specifically for the law enforcement and military markets  which are markets that we underserved in recent years 
we introduced our m p tactical rifle 
this represents our first effort to diversify beyond the handgun market 
the tactical rifle market is one segment within the rifle and shotgun market long guns 
the domestic long gun market is over billion  about greater than the domestic handgun market 
market research indicates that the smith wesson name is very strong in the long gun market 
our increased emphasis on federal government sales led to four orders from the us government for the afghanistan national police and border patrol 
the sigma orders totaled approximately million  with approximately million being shipped in fiscal  with the balance to ship during first half of fiscal we have successfully transitioned from a consumer sales force that was a combination of our employees and manufacturers representatives to an all employee consumer sales force 
in the six months prior to the transition  consumer sales were up year over year 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the first quarter with an all employee sales force  sales were up and in the fourth quarter were up 
we have expanded our law enforcement and military sales efforts 
during fiscal  we hired a director of law enforcement sales and a director of federal government sales 
we have also added four new salesmen to our law enforcement sales force 
we invested over million in machinery and equipment  with most of it directed at expanding our pistol business 
the pistol category represents about of the domestic handgun market  and our pistol sales in fiscal grew by 
restatement sec inquiry in august  we amended various reports previously filed with the sec to modify certain accounting matters related to our acquisition of smith wesson corp 
we restated our form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  as well as our form qsb reports for the quarters ended july  and  october  and  and january  and the form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  was filed in december and included restated financial statements for fiscal the amended form qsb reports for the july and october quarters were filed in january  and the amended form qsb reports for the january quarters were filed in march the sec is conducting an informal inquiry regarding the circumstances surrounding the restatement 
we are cooperating fully with the sec in this inquiry 
the inquiry is still ongoing 

table of contents management objectives in fiscal  we added several new senior managers to our company  including a new chief executive officer in december the new management team has been assessing our business  including extensive market research about the smith wesson brand  the firearms market  and our competitors 
our research has determined that the smith wesson brand stands for safety  security  protection  and sport 
our management team has decided to focus its strategy around those four items 
all future ventures and licensing opportunities will fit under the umbrella of safety  security  protection  and sport 
it is our view that opportunities for our company extend beyond handguns 
this belief is supported by brand research that has identified several areas where the smith wesson brand has a strong recognition among prospective buyers 
while we will continue to focus on handguns  with an increased emphasis on the military and law enforcement markets  we will also look beyond handguns using safety  security  protection  and sport as the guide for determining business expansion 
our business we are one of the largest handgun manufacturers in the world 
we offer one of the broadest lines of handguns in the industry 
our product line consists of both revolvers and pistols 
in fiscal  we entered the long gun market with the introduction of the m p rifles 
we are also one of the largest manufacturers of handcuffs and restraints in the united states 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various product lines by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 
key industry data the handgun market in the united states has remained relatively constant over the past years 
handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the through period  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns in fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
the market levels returned to pre levels and have remained relatively unchanged 
within the us handgun market  approximately of the market is pistols and is revolvers 
we are the largest manufacturer in the revolver market and believe that we are the third largest manufacturer in the pistol market 
there is very little market data available on the firearms industry 
federal excise tax collections represent the best measurement of us market share 
the us government issues this information on a quarterly basis 
by comparing our tax payment to the reported collection  we can estimate our market share 
based upon the most recent data  we believe that we have approximately a share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares to in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
it also compares favorably with market share figures of the s when we had an estimated market share

partially offsetting some of the gains in these two areas was a decline in our traditional metal frame pistols and lower sw pistol sales

income taxes our income tax expense for fiscal was  compared with an income tax expense of  in fiscal and an income tax benefit of  in fiscal the tax provision for fiscal included a federal and state deferred tax rate change of  the tax provision for fiscal included a  adjustment resulting from the write off of an internal revenue code section limitation to our federal net operating loss carryforward of  and  of tax expense related to tax adjustments on exercises of employee stock 
table of contents options under sfas r 
the tax benefit for fiscal was primarily attributable to the federal net operating loss adjustments and the reversal of  of our state tax valuation allowance 
the fiscal tax provision included a  benefit for federal net operating loss adjustments 
this benefit related to the filing of amended fiscal and federal income tax returns to recognize tax deductions for warrant and option exercises 
we were previously not entitled to these deductions  as we had not complied with federal statutory reporting requirements 
we have subsequently complied with these reporting requirements  and we therefore are now entitled to realize these tax benefits related to the warrant and option exercises 
our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets  liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately million  before valuation allowance  at april  in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our net operating loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance will be established against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
recording a valuation allowance or reversing a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
no valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april    or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
we do  however  maintain a valuation allowance of approximately   and  provided against our state deferred tax assets as of april    and  respectively 
this valuation allowance specifically relates to state net operating loss carryforwards 
there is uncertainty related to the recognition of the benefit attributable to these state net operating losses 
we reached these conclusions after considering both changes in our business as well as the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and the likelihood of generating future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
differences between forecasted and actual future operating results could adversely impact our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to million  million  and million as of april    and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforward at april  expires in fiscal years and section limits utilization of these losses to  per year 
effective april   it was determined that  of net operating loss carryforwards will expire unutilized 
therefore  the related deferred tax asset of  was reversed to tax expense in fiscal it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in additional ownership changes pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards which can be utilized 
federal net operating losses account for million of the total net deferred tax asset of million and million of the million of deferred tax assets as of april  and  respectively 
state net operating loss carryforwards amounted to million  million  and million as of april    and  respectively  most of which expire from fiscal to fiscal certain state provisions may limit our ability to utilize state net operating losses in any given year when certain events occur  including cumulative changes in ownership interests over a three year period 
in our opinion  due to the uncertainty of the realization of the benefit from state net operating losses  a valuation allowance will be maintained against most of these deferred tax assets 
on october   the american jobs creation act  or ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activity  or qpa  which will be phased in from through pursuant to fasb staff position no 
 application of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activity provided by the ajca of  the effect of this deduction is reported in the period in which it is claimed on our tax return 
the qpa deduction is expected to be available to us starting in fiscal no deduction will be available in a year we have a tax loss or no taxable 
table of contents income due to operating loss carryforwards 
as we have net operating loss carryforwards  further analysis is required in order to determine the timing and impact of the qpa on our financial statements 
in return for the qpa  the ajca provides for a two year transition from the existing extraterritorial income exclusion  or eti  tax benefit for foreign sales  which the world trade organization  or wto  ruled was an illegal export subsidy 
the eti benefit will be fully phased out for us in fiscal the eti benefit for us was approximately  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
net income the following table sets forth certain information regarding net income and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and change change net income net income per share basic diluted the increase in net income and net income per share for fiscal was attributable to a increase in sales  the  one time benefit from the reduction in the environmental reserves  and a  reduction in interest expense driven by the refinancing that took place in january fiscal results also reflected the million benefit of an agreement reached with one of our insurance carriers  which included a net cash refund of approximately million 
the increase in net income and net income per share for fiscal resulted primarily from a reduction in operating expenses 
fiscal spending included  related to the discontinued crossings catalog and advanced technology divisions   related to the restructuring costs relative to the closing our corporate office in scottsdale   related to legal and accounting fees relative to the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  and the sec inquiry

cash flow from operating activities increased by  for fiscal compared with fiscal the improvement in operating cash flow for fiscal was attributable to improved profitability  that was further enhanced by our use of tax loss carryforwards 
non cash expenses  such as depreciation and stock based compensation expense  also had a significant impact on fiscal results 
depreciation and amortization increased by  while stock based compensation expense was  higher 
the substantial increase in accounts receivable at april  reflected record sales in the month of april sales for the month were million  million higher than for april

the proceeds from that sale were  the proceeds from this sale were used to repurchase  warrants to purchase common stock from two former officers of our company at a cost  proceeds from the exercise of common stock and warrants totaled  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal in fiscal  we completed a refinancing that resulted in our repaying a million note to tomkins corporation with a combination of collateralized cash deposits and the proceeds from an million note we obtained from banknorth na the  increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal  resulted from our repayment of the million tomkins note as well as the refinancing of our banknorth debt in january we incurred  in costs relative to the refinancing effort 
at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating  at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have a  revolving line of credit with banknorth  there was no outstanding balance as of april  other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
the more significant estimates and assumptions used by the us in the preparation of the financial statements relate to the reserves established for uncollectible accounts receivable  obsolete and slow moving inventory  and certain accrued liabilities  including product  environmental  and warranty liabilities and workers compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition we primarily recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize these revenues when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectibility is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize trademark licensing revenues for all individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on actual receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  these revenues are payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize fees received upon initial signing of license agreements as revenues 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectibility does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not initially recognize minimum royalty payments  but instead record such revenue when the minimum royalty is paid 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to approximately million 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel

warranty we generally provide a lifetime warranty to the original purchaser of our new firearms products 
we provide for estimated warranty obligations in the period in which we recognize the related revenue 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical claims experience and the current repair costs 
we make adjustments to accruals as warranty claim data and historical experience warrant 
should we experience actual claims and repair costs that are higher than the estimated claims and repair costs used to calculate the provision  our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize would be adversely impacted

we place past due balances for collection with an outside agency after days 
we write off balances deemed uncollectible by us against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts through current past due balances  knowledge of our customers financial situations  and past payment history 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
