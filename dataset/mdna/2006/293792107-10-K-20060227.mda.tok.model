table of contents capital spending we are committed to the long term growth and viability of enterprise products partners 
part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations  growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures 
in recent years  major oil and gas companies have sold non strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate 
we forecast that this trend will continue  and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures 
management continues to analyze potential acquisitions  joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions 
we believe that we are positioned to continue to grow through construction of new facilities and acquisitions that will expand our system of assets and through growth capital projects 
we estimate our consolidated capital spending during will approximate billion  which includes estimated expenditures of approximately billion for growth capital projects and acquisitions and approximately million for sustaining capital expenditures 
our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures is based upon our strategic operating and growth plans  which are also dependent upon our ability to generate capital from operating cash flows or otherwise obtain the capital necessary to accomplish our objectives 
our forecast may change due to factors beyond our control  such as weather related issues  changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions 
further  our forecast may change as a result of decisions made at a later date  which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners 
our success in raising capital  including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks  continues to be the principal factor that determines how much we can spend 
we believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs  and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed above  we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets

we expect this expansion to be completed in mid we have also announced our intent to build a new gas processing plant with a capacity of mmcf d adjacent to the pioneer plant 
we expect to place the new facility in service during the pioneer expansion and the new natural gas processing plant will serve growing natural gas production in the jonah and pinedale fields 
the cost of this new processing facility is expected to be million 
natural gas storage expansion 
in december  we completed the conversion of an existing brine well located at our petal  mississippi storage facility to a bcf natural gas storage cavern at a cost of million 
due to strong demand for natural gas storage  we have commenced the development of an additional storage cavern at the petal facility that is expected to add bcf of storage capacity 
this cavern is expected to cost million and be placed in service during the first quarter of 
table of contents expansion of mont belvieu ngl and petrochemical storage services 
in november  we announced an expansion of our ngl and petrochemical storage services at our complex in mont belvieu  texas to improve our ability to receive and deliver ngls and petrochemicals 
the mont belvieu expansion projects include the drilling of two new brine production wells and the construction of two above ground brine storage pits 
the increased brine storage capability will further enable us to enhance product storage services and movement to transportation and distribution pipelines that serve the gulf coast region  as well as our import and export facilities on the houston ship channel 
as a result of these projects  we will also more than double our above ground brine storage capabilities to mmbbls and will increase our capacity to produce brine 
these projects are expected to be placed in service in and and are expected to cost million 
hobbs ngl fractionator 
in june  we announced plans to construct a new ngl fractionator  designed to handle up to mbpd of mixed ngls  located at the interconnection of our mid america pipeline system and our seminole pipeline near hobbs  new mexico 
additionally  we will construct a purity ethane storage well near the new fractionator and reconfigure the interconnection between our mid america pipeline system and the seminole pipeline 
these projects are expected to cost million and be placed in service by mid our hobbs ngl fractionator will process the increase in mixed ngls resulting from our phase i expansion of the mid america pipeline system 
mid america pipeline system phase i expansion 
in january  we announced an expansion of the rocky mountain segment of our mid america pipeline system to accommodate an expected increase in mixed ngls originating from producing basins in wyoming  utah  colorado and new mexico 
the expansion project will be completed in stages and will increase throughput volumes on the segment by a total of mbpd 
we expect final completion of the phase i expansion during the second quarter of at a cost of million 
we expect to receive the necessary regulatory approval and begin construction on our phase i expansion project in the first quarter of expansion of mont belvieu ngl fractionator 
in january  we began a project to expand the processing capacity of our mont belvieu ngl fractionator from mbpd to mbpd and to reduce energy costs 
this expansion project will enable us to accommodate a portion of an expected increase in ngl production from the rocky mountains 
the project is expected to cost approximately million and be completed in mid independence hub platform and independence trail pipeline system 
in november  we entered into an agreement with the atwater valley producers group for the dedication  processing and gathering of natural gas and condensate production from several natural gas fields in the atwater valley  desoto canyon  lloyd ridge and mississippi canyon areas collectively  the anchor fields of the deepwater gulf of mexico 
first production is expected in we are constructing and will own the independence hub platform  which will be located in mississippi canyon block  at a water depth of  feet 
the independence hub is a foot deep draft  semi submersible platform with a two level production deck  which will process bcf d of natural gas 
the platform  which is estimated to cost million  will be operated by anadarko  and is designed to process production from its anchor fields and has excess payload capacity to support ten additional pipeline risers 
in december  we entered into an agreement with cal dive international inc cal dive to sell them a indirect interest in the independence hub platform 
additionally  we will construct  own  and operate the mile independence trail natural gas pipeline system  which will have a throughput capacity of bcf d of natural gas 
the pipeline system  which is estimated to cost million  will transport production from the independence hub platform to the tennessee gas pipeline 
pipeline integrity costs our ngl  petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the us department of transportation  through its office of pipeline safety 
this federal 
table of contents agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines which include ngl and petrochemical pipelines and natural gas pipelines 
in general  these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas as defined by the regulation and to perform any necessary repairs 
in connection with the regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines  we developed a pipeline integrity management program in in connection with the regulations for natural gas pipelines  we developed a pipeline integrity management program in during  we spent approximately million to comply with these programs  of which million was recorded as an operating expense  and the remaining million was capitalized 
we spent approximately million to comply with these programs during  of which million was recorded as an operating expense and the remaining million was capitalized 
we expect our net cash outlay for pipeline integrity program expenditures to approximate million during our forecast is net of certain costs we expect to recover from el paso 
in april  gulfterra acquired several midstream assets located in texas and new mexico from el paso 
these assets include the texas intrastate system and the permian basin system 
el paso agreed to indemnify gulfterra for any pipeline integrity costs it incurred whether paid or payable during  and with respect to such assets  to the extent that such annual costs exceed million  however  the aggregate amount reimbursable by el paso for these periods is capped at million 
during  we expect to recover million from el paso related to our expenditures  which leaves a remainder of million reimbursable by el paso for and pipeline integrity costs 
results of operations we have four reportable business segments ngl pipelines services  onshore natural gas pipelines services  offshore pipelines services and petrochemical services 
our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered or technology employed and products produced and or sold 
we evaluate segment performance based on the non generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measure of gross operating margin 
gross operating margin either in total or by individual segment is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results 
the financial measure calculated using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income 
our non gaap financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to gaap operating income 
we define total or consolidated segment gross operating margin as operating income before i depreciation and amortization expense  ii operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation  iii gains and losses on the sale of assets  and iv general and administrative expenses 
gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions  provision for income taxes  minority interest  extraordinary charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses net of the adjustments noted above from segment revenues  with both segment totals before the elimination of intersegment and intrasegment transactions 
for additional information regarding our business segments  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
we have historically included equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income 
our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy 
they are a means by which we conduct our operations to 
table of contents align our interests with those of our customers  which may be suppliers of raw materials or consumers of finished products 
this method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand alone basis 
many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations 
our integrated midstream energy asset system including the midstream energy assets of our equity method investees provides services to producers and consumers of natural gas  ngls and petrochemicals 
our asset system has multiple entry points 
in general  hydrocarbons can enter our asset system in a number of ways  including an offshore natural gas or crude oil pipeline  an offshore platform  a natural gas processing plant  an ngl gathering pipeline  an ngl fractionator  an ngl storage facility  an ngl transportation or distribution pipeline or an onshore natural gas pipeline 
at each link along this asset system  we earn revenues based on volume or an ownership of products such as ngls 
many of our equity investments are present within our integrated midstream asset system 
for example  we have ownership interests in several offshore natural gas and crude oil pipelines 
other examples include our use of the promix ngl fractionator to process ngls extracted by our gas plants 
the ngls received from promix then can be sold in our ngl marketing activities 
given the integral nature of our equity investees to our operations  we believe treatment of earnings from our equity method investees as a component of gross operating margin and operating income is appropriate

due to our geographic and business diversification  hurricanes katrina august and rita september had varying effects across our business segments 
the hurricanes impacted supply and demand for natural gas  ngls  crude oil and motor gasoline 
in general  this resulted in an increase in energy commodity prices  which was exacerbated in certain regions due to local supply and demand imbalances 
the disruptions in natural gas  ngl and crude oil production along the us gulf coast resulted in decreased volumes for some of our pipeline systems  natural gas processing plants and ngl fractionators  which in turn caused a decrease in our gross operating margin from certain operations 
in addition  operating costs at certain of our plants and pipelines were negatively impacted due to the higher fuel costs 
these adverse effects were mitigated by increases in gross operating margin from certain of other operations  which benefited from increased demand for ngls and octane additives  regional demand for natural gas and the general increase in commodity prices 
we estimate that hurricanes katrina and rita reduced our gross operating margin in by approximately million as a result of decreased transportation and processing volumes and higher hurricane related expenses and insurance premium costs 
our results of operations reflect a million cash receipt related to the settlement of certain business interruption insurance claims from hurricane ivan in september we are at varying stages of the insurance claims process with respect to these hurricanes and expect to receive additional insurance recoveries in and for additional information regarding our insurance claims related to these storm events  please read results of operations significant risks and uncertainties hurricanes included within this item the following information highlights significant year to year variances in gross operating margin by business segment ngl pipelines services

table of contents significant risks and uncertainties hurricanes the following is a discussion of the general status of insurance claims related to recent hurricanes that affected our assets 
to the extent we include any estimate or range of estimates regarding the dollar value of damages  please be aware that a change in our estimates may occur as additional information becomes available to us 
hurricane ivan insurance claims 
our final purchase price allocation for the gulfterra merger includes a million receivable for insurance claims related to expenditures to repair property damage to certain gulfterra assets caused by hurricane ivan  which struck the eastern us gulf coast region in september prior to the gulfterra merger 
these expenditures represent our costs to restore the damaged facilities to operation 
since this loss event occurred prior to completion of the gulfterra merger  the claim was filed under the insurance program of gulfterra and el paso 
since year end  we received cash reimbursements from insurance carriers totaling million related to these property damage claims  and we expect to recover the remaining million by mid if the final recovery of funds is different than the amount previously expended  we will recognize an income impact at that time 
in addition  we have submitted business interruption insurance claims for our estimated losses caused by hurricane ivan 
during the fourth quarter of  we received million from such claims 
in addition  we estimate an additional million to million will be received during the first quarter of to the extent we receive cash proceeds from such business interruption claims  they will be recorded as a gain in our statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income in the period in which funds are received 
hurricanes katrina and rita insurance claims 
hurricanes katrina and rita affected certain of our gulf coast assets in august and september of  respectively 
inspection  evaluation of property damage to our facilities and repairs are a continuing effort 
we expensed million during the third quarter of related to property damage insurance deductibles for these storms 
to the extent that insurance proceeds from property damage claims do not cover our actual cash expenditures in excess of the insurance deductibles we have expensed  such shortfall will be expensed when realized 
we recorded million of estimated recoveries from property damage claims based on amounts expended through december  in addition  we expect to file business interruption claims for losses related to these hurricanes 
to the extent we receive cash proceeds from such business interruption claims  they will be recorded as a gain in our statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income in the period of receipt 

table of contents general outlook for we expect our results of operations to be affected by the following key trends and events during we believe that drilling activity in the major producing areas where we operate  including the rocky mountains  san juan basin and deepwater gulf of mexico  will result in increased demand for our midstream energy services 
as a result  we expect higher transportation and processing volumes for our assets due to increased natural gas and crude oil production from both the rocky mountains and deepwater gulf of mexico 
hurricanes katrina and rita reduced natural gas and crude oil production in the gulf of mexico during the latter half of barring any other major storms or similar disruptions  we believe that gulf of mexico production will return to pre hurricane levels by mid we are currently in a major asset construction phase that began in with several major projects underway and announced to begin this year  fiscal will be a transition year as we continue to invest in multiple projects that will further diversify our portfolio of midstream assets 
we believe that completion of these projects will generate additional cash flows beginning in our significant growth capital projects are supported by long term agreements with producers in significant supply basins  which include the piceance basin in colorado  the jonah and pinedale fields in the greater green river basin in wyoming and the deepwater gulf of mexico 
we believe that our natural gas and ngl facilities located in central louisiana and our marco polo oil pipeline  marco polo platform and cameron highway oil pipeline located in the gulf of mexico are poised to benefit as production volumes increase from developments in the southern green canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico 
volumes on our cameron highway oil pipeline were adversely affected during the fourth quarter of due to disruption of production caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  and these volumes are expected to continue to be adversely affected during the first quarter of however  we currently expect significant increases in cameron highway oil pipeline volumes during the remainder of as production increases  including production at the mad dog field and initial production from the ticonderoga  k north and timon fields 
we believe that the strength of the domestic and global economy will continue to drive increased demand for all forms of energy despite higher commodity prices 
our largest ngl consuming customers in the ethylene industry continue to see strong demand for their products  which enables them to raise prices to mitigate higher fuel and feedstock costs 
with the unusually high price of crude oil relative to natural gas  ethane and propane are the preferred feedstocks for the ethylene industry 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service  are for capital expenditures  business acquisitions and distributions to our partners 
we expect to fund our short term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows and short term revolving credit arrangements 
capital expenditures for long term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources either separately or in combination including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities  the issuance of additional equity and debt securities 
we expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows 
our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and or refinancing arrangements 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately million of available credit under our operating partnership s multi year revolving credit facility 

table of contents in total  we had approximately billion in principal outstanding under various debt agreements at december  as a result of our growth objectives  we expect to access debt and equity capital markets from time to time and we believe that financing arrangements to support our growth activities can be obtained on reasonable terms 
furthermore  we believe that maintenance of an investment grade credit rating combined with continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short term liquidity and capital resource requirements

for information regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts  please see the statements of consolidated cash flows included under item of this annual report 
for year ended december  net cash provided from operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities we prepare our statements of consolidated cash flows using the indirect method 
the indirect method derives net cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income to remove i the effects of all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments  such as changes during the period in inventory  deferred income and the like  ii the effects of all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and cash payments  such as changes during the period in receivables and payables  and iii the effects of all items classified as investing or financing cash flows  such as gains or losses on sale of assets or gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt 
in general  the net effect of changes in operating accounts results from the timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses during 
table of contents each period 
increases or decreases in inventory balances are influenced by changes in commodity prices and the quantity of products held in connection with our marketing activities 
in addition  noncash items that were subtracted in determining income must be added back in determining net cash flows from operating activities 
each of these noncash items is a charge against income but does not decrease cash 
items to be added back include depreciation  amortization of intangibles  amortization in interest expense  operating lease expense paid by epco  provisions for impairments of long lived assets and increases in deferred tax liabilities 
conversely  noncash items that were added in determining income such as amortization of bond premiums or decreases in deferred tax liabilities must be subtracted in determining net cash flows from operating activities 
equity in income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates is also a non cash item that must be removed in determining net cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flows from operating activities reflect the actual cash distributions we receive from such investees 
net cash provided from operating activities is largely dependent on earnings from our business activities 
as a result  these cash flows are exposed to certain risks 
we operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry 
we provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas  ngls and crude oil 
the products that we process  sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential  agricultural and commercial heating  feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing  and in the production of motor gasoline 
reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers  whether because of general economic conditions  reduced demand for the end products made with our products or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business  please read item a of this annual report 
cash used in investing activities primarily represents expenditures for capital projects  business combinations  asset purchases and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
cash provided by or used in financing activities generally consists of borrowings and repayments of debt  distributions to partners and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities

the following information highlights the significant year to year variances in our cash flow amounts comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in compared to million in the million  or  year to year increase in net cash provided from operating activities is primarily due to net income adjusted for all non cash items and the net effects of changes in operating accounts increased million year to year primarily due to the addition of earnings from assets acquired in connection with the gulfterra merger in september distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates decreased by million year to year primarily due to the consolidation of gulfterra gp in september partially offset by increased cash distributions from offshore gulf of mexico investments 
gulfterra gp accounted for million in cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates during the carrying value of our inventories increased from million at december  to million at december  the million increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices during when compared to and an increase in volumes purchased and held in inventory in connection with our marketing activities at december  versus december

for additional information regarding our debt obligations  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
estimated cash payments for interest we are obligated to make interest payments on our debt principal amounts outstanding 
the amounts shown in the preceding table for estimated cash interest payments represent our forecast of variable and fixed interest payments to be made in connection with debt principal amounts outstanding at december  our estimates of future cash interest payments include the following amounts to be paid in connection with variable interest rates million in total  million for  million for  million for each of and  and million for we estimated our variable interest rate cash payments by multiplying the weighted average variable interest rate paid during under each of our variable rate debt obligations that were outstanding at december  by the debt principal amount outstanding at that date and assumed that the balance outstanding would not change until maturity 
our estimates of cash interest payments to be paid under fixed interest rate obligations were determined by multiplying the fixed interest rate associated with each fixed rate obligation for each period that the principal would be outstanding until maturity 
to the extent that we have exchanged a fixed interest rate for a variable interest rate  we have included the impact of such interest rate swap agreements in our calculations 
our internal estimates of long term interest rates indicate that variable interest rates may exceed the fixed interest rates of the debt obligations underlying our interest rate swap agreements 
if this occurs  we are responsible for payment of the excess of the current variable interest rate over the fixed 
table of contents interest rate of the underlying debt obligation

recent accounting developments the following information summarizes recently issued accounting guidance that will or may affect our financial statements in the future sfas r  share based payment  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board apb and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value method 
historically  we have accounted for our share based transactions using apb we adopted sfas r on january   which resulted in our recording a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
during  we expect to record compensation expense of million associated with the fair value method of accounting for unit options  profits interests and nonvested or restricted units using sfas r based on awards outstanding at january  sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
we adopted sfas on january  emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for purchases and sale of inventory with the same counterparty  requires that two or more inventory transactions with the same counterparty be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction  if the transactions were entered into in contemplation of one another 
exchanges of inventory between entities in the same line of business should be accounted for at fair value or recorded at carrying amounts  depending on the classification of such inventory 
we are still evaluating this recent guidance  which is effective april  for our partnership  but we do not believe that our revenues or costs and expenses will be materially affected 

table of contents critical accounting policies in our financial reporting process  we employ methods  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements 
these methods  estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
the following describes the estimation risk underlying our most significant financial statement items depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment in general  depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
the majority of our property  plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method  which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets 
our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets 
at the time we place our assets in service  we believe such assumptions are reasonable  however  circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions  which would change our depreciation amounts on a going forward basis 
some of these circumstances include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements  changes in expected costs for dismantlement  restoration and abandonment as a result of changes  or expected changes  in labor  materials and other related costs associated with these activities  changes in the useful life of an asset based on the actual known life of similar assets  changes in technology  or other factors  and changes in expected salvage proceeds as a result of a change  or expected change in the salvage market 
at december  and  the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively 
we recorded million  million and million in depreciation expense during  and  respectively 
a significant portion of the year to year increase in depreciation expense between and is attributable to the property  plant and equipment assets we acquired in the gulfterra merger in september for additional information regarding our property  plant and equipment  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
measuring recoverability of long lived assets and equity method investments in general  long lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas  oil or ngls 
long lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future expected cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset 
our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes  estimated useful life of the asset or asset group  and estimated salvage values 
an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long lived asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value  which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows 
those assumptions also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes  market values and replacement cost estimates 
we recorded million and million for asset impairment charges in and  respectively  related to ngl fractionation and storage facilities located in mississippi 
equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible loss in value for the investment other than a temporary decline 
examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long term negative changes in the investee s industry 
the carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment 
this estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates  
table of contents probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios  anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment 
a significant change in these underlying assumptions could result in our recording an impairment charge 
due to a deteriorating business environment  bef evaluated the carrying value of its long lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of this review indicated that the carrying value of its long lived assets exceeded their collective fair value  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million 
since bef was one of our equity investments at that time  our share of this loss was million and was recorded as a component of equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during for additional information regarding our asset impairment charges  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets the specific  identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations 
potential intangible assets include intellectual property  such as technology  patents  trademarks and trade names  customer contracts and relationships  and non compete agreements  as well as other intangible assets 
the method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset  the business in which it is utilized  and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate 
our customer relationship intangible assets primarily represent the customer base we acquired in connection with the gulfterra merger and related transactions 
the value we assigned to these customer relationships is being amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the underlying oil and natural gas resource bases from which the customers produce are estimated to be consumed or otherwise used 
our estimate of the useful life of each resource base is based on a number of factors  including third party reserve estimates  the economic viability of production and exploration activities and other industry factors 
our contract based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements  such as the long term rights we possess under the shell natural gas processing agreement 
a contract based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life or term  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of an entity 
our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors  including i the expected useful life of the related tangible assets eg  fractionation facility  pipeline  etc  ii any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights  and iii any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements 
if our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change  then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly 
additionally  if we determine that an intangible asset s unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment  we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset 
any such write down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time 
at december  and  the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was million and million  respectively 
we recorded million  million and million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets during  and  respectively 
a significant portion of the year to year increase in amortization expense between and is attributable to the intangible assets we acquired in the gulfterra merger 
for additional information regarding our intangible assets  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 

table of contents methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values and is primarily comprised of million associated with the gulfterra merger 
we do not amortize goodwill  however  we test our goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment during the second quarter of each fiscal year  and more frequently  if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount 
our goodwill testing involves the determination of a reporting unit s fair value  which is predicated on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit 
such assumptions include i discrete financial forecasts for the assets contained within the reporting unit  which rely on management s estimates of operating margins and transportation volumes  ii long term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period  and iii appropriate discount rates 
if the fair value of the reporting unit including its inherent goodwill is less than its carrying value  a charge to earnings is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
at december  and  the carrying value of our goodwill was million and million  respectively 
for additional information regarding our goodwill  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
our revenue recognition policies and use of estimates for revenues and expenses in general  we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
when sales contracts are settled ie  either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed  we record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts 
our use of certain estimates for revenues and operating costs and other expenses has increased as a result of sec regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames 
such estimates are necessary due to the timing of compiling actual billing information and receiving third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes 
one example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month prior to receiving actual customer and vendor related plant operating information for the subject period 
these estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor invoiced amounts 
accordingly  we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations 
such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month  adjusted accordingly for any known or expected changes in volumes or rates through the end of the month 
if the basis of our estimates proves to be substantially incorrect  it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods 
reserves for environmental matters each of our business segments is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control 
such laws and regulations may  in certain instances  require us to remediate current or former operating sites where specified substances have been released or disposed of 
we accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
our assessments are based on studies  as well as site surveys  to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage 
future environmental developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and additional claims for damages to property  employees and other persons resulting from current or past operations  could result in substantial additional costs beyond our current reserves 
at december  and  we had a liability for environmental remediation of million  which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys 
in accordance with sfas accounting for contingencies and financial accounting standards board 
table of contents interpretation fin  reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss  we recorded our best estimate of these remediation activities 
natural gas imbalances natural gas imbalances result when customers physically deliver a larger or smaller quantity of natural gas into our pipelines than they take out 
in general  we value such imbalances using a twelve month moving average of natural gas prices  which we believe is reasonable given that the actual settlement dates for such imbalances are generally not known 
as a result  significant changes in natural gas prices between reporting periods may impact our estimates 
at december  and  our imbalance receivables were million and million  respectively  and are reflected as a component of accounts receivable 
at december  and  our imbalance payables were million and million  respectively  and are reflected as a component of accrued gas payables 
summary of related party transactions in accordance with sfas  related party disclosures  we have identified our material related party revenues and costs and expenses 
the following table summarizes our related party transactions for the periods indicated dollars in thousands

for information regarding certain business relationships and related transactions  please read item of this annual report 
we have an extensive and ongoing relationship with epco and its affiliates  including teppco 
our revenues from epco and affiliates are primarily associated with sales of ngl products 
our expenses with epco are primarily due to i reimbursements we pay epco in connection with an administrative services agreement and ii purchases of ngl products 
teppco is an affiliate of ours due to the common control relationship of both entities 
historically  shell was considered a related party under gaap because it owned more than of our limited partner interests and  prior to  held a membership interest in enterprise products gp 
as a result of shell selling a portion of its limited partner interests in us to third parties and our issuance of additional common units  shell owned less than of our common units at the beginning of shell sold its interest in enterprise products gp to an affiliate of epco in september as a result of shell s reduced equity interest in us and its lack of control of enterprise products gp  shell ceased to be considered a related party under gaap in january 
table of contents many of our unconsolidated affiliates perform supporting or complementary roles to our consolidated business operations 
the majority of our revenues from unconsolidated affiliates relate to natural gas sales to a louisiana affiliate 
the majority of our expenses with unconsolidated affiliates pertain to payments to promix for ngl transportation  storage and fractionation services

these subleases are part of the administrative services agreement that we executed with epco in connection with our formation in epco holds this equipment pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation 
we record the full value of such lease payments made by epco as a non cash related party operating expense  with the offset to partners equity recorded as a general contribution to our partnership 
apart from the partnership interests we granted to epco at our formation  epco does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases

table of contents financial statement reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation 
during  we changed the classification of changes in restricted cash in our statements of consolidated cash flows to present such changes as an investing activity 
we previously presented such changes as an operating activity 
in the accompanying statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended december  and  we reclassified the change in restricted cash to be consistent with our presentation 
this reclassification resulted in a million and million increase to cash flows used in investing activities and a corresponding increase to cash provided by operating activities from the amounts previously presented for the years ended december  and  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we may use financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions 
in general  the type of risks we attempt to hedge are those related to the variability of future earnings  fair values of certain debt instruments and cash flows resulting from changes in applicable interest rates or commodity prices 
as a matter of policy  we do not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we recognize financial instruments as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets based on fair value 
fair value is generally defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  not in a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
we must use considerable judgment  however  in interpreting market data and developing these estimates 
accordingly  our fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize upon disposition of these instruments 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation techniques could have a material effect on our estimates of fair value 
changes in the fair value of financial instrument contracts are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if the financial instruments meet those criteria  the instrument s gains and losses offset the related results of the hedged item in earnings for a fair value hedge and are deferred in other comprehensive income for a cash flow hedge 
gains and losses related to a cash flow hedge are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
for additional information regarding our accounting for financial instruments  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
to qualify as a hedge  the item to be hedged must be exposed to commodity or interest rate risk and the hedging instrument must reduce the exposure and meet the hedging requirements of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 
we must formally designate the financial instrument as a hedge and document and assess the effectiveness of the hedge at inception and on a quarterly basis 
any ineffectiveness of the hedge is recorded in current earnings 
we routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions 
if market conditions warrant  some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure 
when this occurs  we may enter into a new financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates 
interest rate risk hedging program our interest rate exposure results from variable and fixed rate borrowings under debt agreements 
we assess cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate 
table of contents exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks 
we use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including cash flow sensitivity analysis models to forecast the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 
enterprise products gp oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements 
we manage a portion of our interest rate exposures by utilizing interest rate swaps and similar arrangements  which allow us to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
we believe that it is prudent to maintain an appropriate balance of variable rate and fixed rate debt in the current business environment 
as summarized in the following table  we had eleven interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  that were accounted for as fair value hedges

to june june to million the variable rate indicated is the all in variable rate for the current settlement period 
we have designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges under sfas since they mitigate changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt 
as effective fair value hedges  an increase in the fair value of these interest rate swaps is equally offset by an increase in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt 
the offsetting changes in fair value have no effect on current period interest expense 
these eleven agreements have a combined notional amount of billion and match the maturity dates of the underlying debt being hedged 
under each swap agreement  we pay the counterparty a variable interest rate based on six month london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin as defined in each swap agreement  and receive back from the counterparty a fixed interest rate payment based on the stated interest rate of the debt being hedged  with both payments calculated using the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement 
we settle amounts receivable from or payable to the counterparties every six months the settlement period 
the settlement amount is amortized ratably to earnings as either an increase or a decrease in interest expense over the settlement period 
the total fair value of these eleven interest rate swaps at december   was a liability of million  with an offsetting decrease in the fair value of the underlying debt 
interest expense for the years ended december  and reflects a million and million benefit from these swap agreements  respectively 
the following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related change in fair value of the underlying debt at the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
income is not affected by changes in the fair value of these swaps  however  these swaps effectively convert the hedged portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
as a result  interest expense and related cash outlays for debt service will increase or decrease with the change in the periodic reset rate associated with the respective swap 
typically  the reset rate is an agreed upon index rate published for the first day of the six month interest calculation period 
resulting swap fair value at scenario classification december  december  february fv assuming no change in underlying interest rates asset liability   fv assuming increase in underlying interest rates asset liability    fv assuming decrease in underlying interest rates asset liability    
table of contents the fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes the benefit we have already recorded in earnings 
the change in fair value between december  and february  is primarily due to an increase in market interest rates relative to the forward interest rate curve used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments 
the underlying floating libor forward interest rate curve used to determine the february  fair values ranged from approximately to using month reset periods ranging from october to october commodity risk hedging program the prices of natural gas  ngls and petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
in order to manage the risks associated with natural gas and ngls  we may enter into commodity financial instruments 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with i natural gas purchases  ii ngl production and inventories  iii related firm commitments  iv fluctuations in transportation revenues where the underlying fees are based on natural gas index prices and v certain anticipated transactions involving either natural gas or ngls 
the commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument 
historically  we have not hedged our exposure to risks associated with petrochemical products 
we have adopted a policy to govern our use of commodity financial instruments to manage the risks of our natural gas and ngl businesses 
the objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk  defined as remaining within the position limits established by enterprise products gp 
we may enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk  basis risk  physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short term less than days and long term basis  not to exceed months 
enterprise products gp oversees the strategies associated with physical and financial risks such as those mentioned previously  approves specific activities subject to the policy including authorized products  instruments and markets and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy 
at december   we had a limited number of commodity financial instruments in our portfolio  which primarily consisted of economic hedges 
the fair value of our commodity financial instrument portfolio at december  was a liability of million 
we recorded nominal amounts of earnings from our commodity financial instruments during  and product purchase commitments we have long and short term purchase commitments for ngls  petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers 
the purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes 
for additional information regarding these commitments  please read contractual obligations included under item of this annual report
