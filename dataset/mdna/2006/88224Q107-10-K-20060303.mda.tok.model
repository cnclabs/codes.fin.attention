item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our operating results our bank was formed through the acquisition of resource bank  na  which was organized in upon completion of our million private equity offering and the acquisition of resource bank  we commenced operations in december the amount of capital we raised  which we believe is the largest amount of start up capital ever raised for a national bank at that time  was intended to support a significant level of near term growth and permit us to originate and retain loans of a size and type that our targeted customers  middle market businesses and high net worth individuals  would find attractive 
our large initial capitalization resulted in reduced levels of return on equity in prior years 
an important aspect of our growth strategy is the ability to service and effectively manage a large number of loans and deposit accounts in multiple markets in texas 
accordingly  we created an operations infrastructure sufficient to support state wide lending and banking operations 
our historical financial results reflect the development of our company in its early stages  notably in connection with initial start up costs and the raising and retention of excess capital to fund our planned growth 
in and  we incurred significant non interest expenses for the start up and infrastructure costs described above  while revenue items gradually increased as we began to source and originate loans and other earning assets 
beginning in  we achieved improved levels of profitability as these costs have been spread over a larger asset base 
our operating results have improved significantly over the past several years as we moved into full operations

we originate substantially all of the loans held in our portfolio  except in certain instances we have purchased individual leases and lease pools primarily commercial and industrial equipment and vehicles  as well as select loan participations and usda government guaranteed loans 
the following summarizes our loan portfolios by major category as of the dates indicated december in thousands commercial construction real estate consumer equipment leases loans held for sale total 
table of contents we continue to lend primarily in texas 
as of december   a substantial majority of the principal amount of the loans in our portfolio was to businesses and individuals in texas 
this geographic concentration subjects the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions in texas 
within the loan portfolio  loans to the services industry were million  or  of total loans at december  other notable concentrations include million in personal household loans which includes loans to certain high net worth individuals for commercial purposes and mortgage loans held for sale  in addition to consumer loans  million to the contracting industry  million in petrochemical and mining loans and million in investors and investment management company loans 
the risks created by these concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated losses on loans at each balance sheet date 
loan maturity and interest rate sensitivity on december  remaining maturities of selected loans total within year years after years in thousands loan maturity commercial construction total interest rate sensitivity for selected loans with predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total summary of loan loss experience the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the reserve for loan losses at a level consistent with management s assessment of the loan portfolio in light of current economic conditions and market trends 
we did not record a provision for the year ended december   but recorded provisions of million for and million for the provision for loan losses necessary to maintain reserve adequacy decreased due to the improvement in indicators of credit quality in and  such as net charge offs and the level of non performing loans 
the reserve for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves for impaired loans and an estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date  but not yet identified with specified loans 
we regularly evaluate our reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb estimated loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral  and general economic conditions 
all loan commitments rated substandard or worse and greater than  are specifically reviewed and a specific allocation is assigned based on the losses expected to be realized from those loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
credit grades are assigned to all loans greater than  each credit grade is assigned a risk factor  or reserve allocation percentage 
these risk factors are multiplied by the outstanding principal balance and risk weighted by product type to calculate the required reserve 
a similar process is employed to calculate that portion of the required reserve assigned to unfunded loan commitments 
even though portions of the allowance may be allocated to specific loans  the entire allowance is available for any credit that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the reserve allocation percentages assigned to each credit grade have been developed based on an analysis of our historical loss rates and historical loss rates at selected peer banks  adjusted for certain qualitative factors 
qualitative adjustments for such things as general economic conditions  changes in credit policies and lending 
table of contents standards  and changes in the trend and severity of problem loans  can cause the estimation of future losses to differ from past experience 
in addition  the reserve considers the results of reviews performed by independent third party reviewers as reflected in their confirmations of assigned credit grades within the portfolio 
the portion of the allowance that is not derived by the allowance allocation percentages compensates for the uncertainty and complexity in estimating loan and lease losses including factors and conditions that may not be fully reflected in the determination and application of the allowance allocation percentages 
we evaluate many factors and conditions in determining the unallocated portion of the allowance  including the economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit quality trends and general growth in the portfolio 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses exceeds its cumulative historical net charge off experience for the last five years 
the allowance  which has declined as a percent of total loans  is considered adequate and appropriate  given the significant growth in the loan and lease portfolio  current economic conditions in the company s market areas and other factors 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and anticipated future credit losses 
the changes are reflected in the general reserve and in specific reserves as the collectibility of larger classified loans is evaluated with new information 
as our portfolio has matured  historical loss ratios have been closely monitored  and our reserve adequacy relies primarily on our loss history 
currently  the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to our board of directors for their review  consideration and ratification on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  totaled million at december  million at december  and million at december  despite the increase in the total reserve  due to growth in the portfolio  the reserve had decreased to at year end from and of loans held for investment at december  and  respectively

in addition to deposits from our core customers  we also have access to incremental deposits through brokered retail certificates of deposit  or cds 
as of december   brokered retail cds comprised million  or  of total deposits 
our dependence on retail brokered cds is limited by our internal funding guidelines  which as of december   limited borrowing from these sources to of total deposits 
additionally  we have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs 
these borrowing sources include federal funds purchased from our downstream correspondent bank relationships which consist of banks that are smaller than our bank and from our upstream correspondent bank relationships which consist of banks that are larger than our bank  securities sold under repurchase agreements  treasury  tax and loan notes  and advances from the fhlb 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of a total of million of securities sold under repurchase agreements  million of downstream federal funds purchased  million from customer repurchase agreements and million of treasury  tax and loan notes 
credit availability from the fhlb is based on our bank s financial and operating condition and borrowing collateral we hold with the fhlb 
at december   million of our borrowings consisted of borrowings from the fhlb 
our unused fhlb borrowing capacity at december  was approximately million 
as of december   we had unused upstream federal fund lines available from commercial banks of approximately million 
during the year ended december   our average borrowings from these sources were million  of which million related to securities sold under repurchase agreements 
the maximum amount of borrowed funds outstanding at any month end during the year ended december  was million  of which million related to securities sold under repurchase agreements

the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the more significant of these policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
however  the policies noted below could be deemed to meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies 
management considers the policies related to the allowance for loan losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation 
the total allowance for loan losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to current earnings 
the amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of the loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves assigned to certain classified loans and general reserves 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  and more specifically  changes in the expected future receipt of principal and interest payments and or inthe value of pledged collateral 
a reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types in order to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
see summary of loan loss experience for further discussion of the risk factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents new accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date 
we will implement sfas r effective january  we will transition to the fair value based accounting for stock based compensation using a modified version of prospective application modified prospective application 
under modified prospective application  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  additionally  compensation expense for the portion of awards which the requisite service has not been rendered  generally non vested awards that are outstanding as of january   must be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered during the period after the adoption of sfas r 
compensation expense for those earlier awards will be based on the same method and on the same grant date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not adopt the fair value accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
based on stock based compensation awards outstanding at december  for which the requisite service period is not expected to be fully rendered prior to january   we expect to recognize compensation expense comparable to the amounts previously reported  on a quarterly basis and in this document  on a pro forma basis 
future levels of compensation expense will be impacted by new awards  which can not be estimated at this time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
additionally  the financial instruments subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading purposes or held for other than trading 
we are subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on our portfolio of assets held for purposes other than trading 
the effect of other changes  such as foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to us 
the responsibility for managing market risk rests with the bsmc  which operates under policy guidelines established by our board of directors 
the negative acceptable variation in net interest revenue due to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates is generally limited by these guidelines to 
these guidelines also establish maximum levels for short term borrowings  short term assets  and public and brokered deposits 
they also establish minimum levels for unpledged assets  among other things 
compliance with these guidelines is the ongoing responsibility of the bsmc  with exceptions reported to our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
interest rate risk management our interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table 
the table reflects rate sensitive positions as of december   and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates 
the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap asset sensitive  where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities  generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment 
a negative gap liability sensitive will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
to reflect anticipated prepayments  certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows

loans include loans held for sale and are stated at gross 
the table above sets forth the balances as of december  for interest bearing assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the total of non interest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
while a gap interest table is useful in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  an interest rate sensitivity simulation provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
earnings are also affected by the effects of changing interest rates on the value of funding derived from demand deposits and stockholders equity 
we perform a sensitivity analysis to identify interest rate risk exposure on net interest income 
we quantify and measure interest rate risk exposure using a model to dynamically simulate the effect of changes in net interest income relative to changes in interest rates and account balances over the next twelve months based on three interest rate scenarios 
these are a most likely rate scenario and two shock test scenarios 
the most likely rate scenario is based on the consensus forecast of future interest rates published by independent sources 
these forecasts incorporate future spot rates and relevant spreads of instruments that are actively traded in the open market 
the federal reserve s federal funds target affects short term borrowing  the prime lending rate and the london interbank offering rate are the basis for most of our variable rate loan pricing 
the year mortgage rate is also monitored because of its effect on prepayment speeds for mortgage backed securities 
these are our primary interest rate exposures 
we are currently not using derivatives to manage our interest rate exposure 
the two shock test scenarios assume a sustained parallel basis point increase or decrease  respectively  in interest rates 

table of contents our interest rate risk exposure model incorporates assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminable maturity deposits demand deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
changes in prepayment behavior of mortgage backed securities  residential  and commercial mortgage loans in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
the impact of plannedgrowth and new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
this modeling indicated interest rate sensitivity as follows anticipated impact over the next twelve months as compared to most likely scenario bp increase bp decrease bp increase bp decrease december  december  december  december  in thousands change in net interest income due to interest rate levels at  calculating the change in net interest income with a bp decrease would have yielded information that would have been not meaningful 
the simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics  future cash flows  and customer behavior 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors
