we have a core expertise in the area of infectious diseases and are committed to focusing our commercialization and development programs on products used by physician specialists or in hospital settings 
we intend to grow through sales of our marketed product  vancocin capsules hcl  and through the continued development of our product pipeline and potential acquisition of products or companies 
we have one marketed product and multiple product candidates in clinical development 
we market and sell vancocin capsules hcl  the oral capsule formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride  in the us and its territories 
vancocin is a potent antibiotic approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to treat antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile  or c 
difficile  and enterocolitis caused by s 
aureus  including methicillin resistant strains 
we are developing maribavir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus  or cmv  infection  and hcv for the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection 
we have licensed the us and canadian rights for a third product candidate  an intranasal formulation of pleconaril  to schering plough for the treatment of picornavirus infections 
we intend to continue to evaluate in licensing or other means of acquiring products in clinical development  and marketed products  in order to expand our current portfolio 
such products may be intended to treat  or are currently used to treat  the patient populations treated by physician specialists or in hospital settings 
during the year ended december   we were profitable from operations and ended the period with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the fourth quarter represents the fifth consecutive quarter during which we were profitable and the fourth quarter in our history that we were profitable primarily as a result of product sales 
during  we raised an additional million of debt and reduced our debt by million to million 
on march   we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes  which eliminated all long term debt that was outstanding at december  we have an accumulated deficit of million at december  prior to the acquisition of vancocin  our first commercial product  we incurred historical losses 
historical losses resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  write off of acquired technology rights  general and administrative expenses  interest payments on our outstanding debt and sales and marketing expenses 
executive summary during  we experienced the following business activities vancocin entered into supply chain agreements 
expanded manufacturing capabilities 
built inventory to levels we believe necessary to service customers in the near term 
initiated a medical education program 
launched a regional medical scientist team 

table of contents cmv completed a phase clinical trial with maribavir to evaluate the potential for drug interactions 
initiated and completed a phase clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of maribavir in subjects with hepatic impairment 
initiated and completed a phase clinical trial to evaluate the relative bioavailability of different tablet formulations of maribavir 
completed enrollment in a phase clinical trial with maribavir for the prevention of cmv infections in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients

initiated and completed a phase clinical trial with hcv in healthy subjects 
initiated and reported promising preliminary results from a phase b proof of concept dose ranging clinical trial with hcv in hepatitis c infected patients 
operating results increased demand of vancocin due to increased prescriptions  as compared to realized effects of price increases 
released a portion of our deferred income tax valuation allowance 
liquidity reduced debt principal by million through repurchases and conversions 
raised million of net proceeds through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
generated net cash from operating activities of million 
in and going forward  we expect to face a number of challenges  which include the following the commercial sale of approved pharmaceutical products is subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that future vancocin sales will meet or exceed the historical rate of sales for the product  for reasons that include  but are not limited to  generic and non generic competition for vancocin and or changes in prescribing habits 
we will face intense competition in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio 
many of the companies and institutions that we will compete with in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting business development activities 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this report 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing and ultimately commercializing any of our product candidates 
there can be no assurance that cash flows from vancocin sales will be sufficient to fund all of our ongoing development and operational costs over the next several years  that planned clinical trials can be initiated  or that 
table of contents planned or ongoing clinical trials can be successfully concluded or concluded in accordance with our anticipated schedule and costs 
moreover  the results of our business development efforts could require considerable investments 
our actual results could differ materially from those results expressed in  or implied by  our expectations and assumption described in this annual report on form k

recent events issuance of  shares of common stock in december  we sold  shares of newly issued common stock at per share in a public offering 
the net proceeds  after underwriting discounts  commissions and other fees  were million 
the shares included the offering of  shares and the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock 
vancocin capsules amended manufacturing agreement in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a supply agreement with eli lilly and company lilly for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api of vancocin as well as the vancocin finished product for an agreed upon time period 
in november  we amended our manufacturing agreement with lilly which  among other things  increased the amount of vancocin that lilly supplied to us during  for which we agreed to pay up to an additional million  and ensured that lilly continues to supply us with vancocin until at least september  that date will be extended to a later date if our third party supply chain is not qualified by september  the process of qualifying a third party supply chain is now ongoing 
lilly supplied the agreed upon increased product volume in the additional million increased inventory costs and will increase our cost of sales for these specific units 
debt reductions on january   we had million of long term debt

table of contents vancocin capsules contingent consideration in november  we acquired all rights in the us and its territories to manufacture  market and sell vancocin  as well as rights to certain related vancomycin products  from lilly 
we paid lilly an upfront cash payment of million 
during  we were obligated to pay lilly additional purchase price consideration equal to of our net sales of vancocin between million and million 
we surpassed the maximum level of million of net sales of vancocin during and paid lilly additional consideration of million 
we will pay additional amounts based on annual net sales of vancocin as set forth below payment on net sales between million payment on net sales between million through payment on net sales between million no additional payments are due to lilly on net sales of vancocin below or above the net sales levels reflected in the above table 
we will account for the future additional payments as contingent consideration and record an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related intangible assets and a cumulative adjustment to the intangible amortization upon achievement of the related sales milestones 
assuming the maximum threshold is met at the end of each year  the cumulative amortization adjustment would be million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the intangible assets and amortization 
pleconaril schering plough corporation in november  we entered into a license agreement with schering plough under which schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril in the us and canada 
schering plough paid us an upfront option fee of million in november in august  schering plough exercised its option to enter into a full license agreement with us following its assessment of the product s performance in characterization studies 
schering plough paid us an initial license fee of million in december and purchased our inventory of bulk drug substance for an additional million in january we are also eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain targeted regulatory and commercial events  as well as royalties on schering plough s sales of intranasal pleconaril in the licensed territories 
schering plough is now responsible for the development and commercialization of the intranasal formulation of pleconaril for the treatment of the common cold

results of operations years ended december  and for the years ended december  in thousands net product sales total revenues gross margin net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted the improvement in net operating results of million was due primarily to gross margin net product sales less cost of sales provided by vancocin net product sales represented above  and the income tax benefit of 
table of contents releasing a portion of our valuation allowance to establish deferred tax assets 
operating results in were also impacted by million in revenue from the sale of inventory to schering plough pursuant to our license agreement  while includes million in revenue from schering plough agreements 
the net loss in also includes million of costs related to our january restructuring 
revenues revenues consisted of the following for the years ended december  in thousands net product sales license fees and milestones revenues grant and other revenues total revenues revenue vancocin product sales in  vancocin sales commenced in november  upon our acquisition of the product from lilly 
the factors contributing to the level of net sales of vancocin in the year ended december  include a increase in prescriptions  as reported by a third party  over the period and the realization of the sales price increases announced in december  march and august additionally  we believe the net product sales were affected by wholesaler inventory restocking to normal levels during the first quarter of  resulting from lilly s product allocation during the third and fourth quarters of net sales of vancocin were million and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  driven by price increases and prescription demand 
prescriptions increased and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to the same periods in additionally  while fourth quarter prescriptions decreased approximately from third quarter prescriptions  net sales of vancocin in the fourth quarter of increased over the third quarter of the prescription trend in the fourth quarter of compares favorably to the decrease experienced from the third to fourth quarter of this increase was due to the following factors the impact of the price increases announced in august and an increase in estimated wholesaler inventory to levels that we believe to be at the higher end of normal  partially offset by the fact that in the fourth quarter of  the unit mix sold between the two presentations of vancocin favored the lower priced presentation compared to the preceding quarter 
we can not predict future prescription demand with any certainty 
in the periods  net product sales were million for the three and twelve months ended december   which are not comparable to the periods as we acquired vancocin from lilly in november during and a portion of the quarter ended march   vancocin was sold under our transition services agreement with lilly  who was our only customer during the transition period 
the transition agreement was terminated in january  and upon the termination  we began selling directly to wholesalers 
approximately of our sales are to three wholesalers 
vancocin product sales are influenced by prescriptions and wholesaler forecasts of prescription demand  which could be at different levels from period to period 
as of december   we have reviewed net sales under our revenue recognition policy and no deferrals are necessary 
this review also resulted in our determination that the estimated inventory held at the end of december by the three largest wholesalers  although increased from september  was within a normal range for vancocin 

table of contents revenue license fee and milestone revenue license fee and milestone revenue primarily includes the following in  the sale of inventory for million pursuant to the terms of our license agreement with schering plough for intranasal pleconaril 
in  payments of million pursuant to the terms of our license agreement with schering plough for intranasal pleconaril 
in  advanced payments from schering plough of million 
in both and  amortization of payments received under our agreement with wyeth of million 
our license fee and milestone revenues result from existing or future collaborations of development stage product and currently vary greatly from period to period 
see liquidity  operating cash inflows for additional information revenue grant and other revenue for  we recognized no grant and other revenue 
during  we recognized million related to amounts agreed to be paid under our agreement with schering plough and million in grant payments under contracts that were transferred to a third party during cost of sales and gross product margin for the years ended december  in thousands net product sales cost of sales gross product margin vancocin cost of sales includes the cost of materials and distribution costs 
our gross product margin rate net product sales less cost of sales as a percent of net product sales for vancocin increased in to from in  which is primarily the result of our price increases announced in december  march and august our cost to acquire vancocin may be higher if we experience the need for increased production volumes above previously estimated amounts 
as part of our november amendment of our manufacturing agreement with lilly  we increased the amount of vancocin that lilly supplied to us  which resulted in additional costs for finished goods at december  of million 
this additional cost will increase our cost of sales as these specific units are sold  which we expect to sell in the first half of lilly will continue to manufacture finished product for us though september  we also expect our third party supply chain to be operational during thus  while we expect our gross product margin to improve during over  our actual margins will be impacted by the actual volume of finished product we order from each of lilly and osg norwich 
moreover  to the extent that manufacturing yields increase or decrease after the manufacturing of vancocin has been transitioned from lilly to third parties  we anticipate that the unit cost to manufacture vancocin may decrease or increase  respectively 
as a result  we would expect the cost of product sales of vancocin  and accordingly  gross product margin percentage  to fluctuate from quarter to quarter during additionally  if we enter into fee for service agreements with wholesalers in future periods  the fees would negatively impact our gross product margins 

table of contents research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  and other overhead costs 
research and development expenses were divided between our research and development programs in the following manner for the years ended december  in thousands direct core programs cmv hcv vancocin c 
difficile direct non core programs common cold indirect development discovery research total direct core programs related to our cmv program  during we were conducting one phase clinical study involving cmv seropositive subjects who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation and were collecting or analyzing data from several phase clinical trials with maribavir to evaluate the potential for drug interactions  pharmacokinetics in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment  and the evaluation of different tablet formulations 
in november  we completed enrollment in our phase clinical trial 
during  we initiated two phase clinical trials with maribavir to evaluate the potential for drug interactions and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of maribavir in subjects with renal impairment  respectively  and we initiated one phase clinical study involving cmv seropositive subjects who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
related to our hcv program  costs included payments to wyeth made in accordance with our cost sharing arrangement 
during  we initiated phase clinical trials with our hcv compound  hcv wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses 
in addition  during the quarter ended march   we halted development on our former hcv lead product candidate  hcv during  the primary drivers of these costs were phase clinical trials for hcv and preclinical activities related to hcv during  we incurred costs totaling million for research and development activities related to vancocin and c 
difficile 
during  we had no similar activities 
direct non core programs in  we incurred minimal direct costs related to our common cold program 
in  all non core program direct expenses were related to the completion of phase clinical trials with the intranasal formulation of pleconaril  which was our only active product candidate in our non core programs 
the gross costs of million for the year ended december  were netted by a million credit from a revision of the 
table of contents estimated costs accrued for clinical development related to the oral formulation of pleconaril and a million credit resulted from a settlement of a disputed accounts receivable for shared development expenses for oral formulation of pleconaril 
in november  schering plough assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
indirect expenses the decrease in expenses related to indirect development activities was due primarily to the reduction of headcount and costs that resulted from the january restructuring 
we had no discovery research costs in as we exited these activities in our january restructuring 
in  our indirect expenses related to our discovery research activities also included in million costs related to the january restructuring 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses of million decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the million decrease was primarily due to million of costs related to the january restructuring  million charge related to the exit of an operating lease in  and million of second quarter costs related to our terminated bond offering 
after considering these expenses  mg a increased by million primarily due to commercial and other personnel related expenses  partially offset by reduced facility costs 
intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization is the result of the vancocin product rights acquisition in the fourth quarter of we had a valuation study performed by a third party  based on information provided by management  to determine the allocation of the estimated purchase price of the vancocin acquisition among the intangible assets acquired as well as their estimated amortization period 
intangible amortization was million for and million for the period includes million of cumulative amortization related to million contingent consideration 
to the extent that we incur an obligation to lilly for additional payments on vancocin sales  as described in our agreement with lilly  we will account for any future payment to lilly as a contingent consideration and record an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related intangible asset and a cumulative adjustment to the intangible amortization upon achievement of the related sales milestones 
contingent consideration and lilly related additional payments are more fully described under recent events  vancocin capsules above and in note of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of these intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has impaired the value of the assets or modified their estimated useful lives 
as of december   there was no impairment of the carrying value of the intangible assets or change to the useful lives as estimated at the acquisition date 
other income expense change in fair value of derivative liability based upon relevant information available  we estimated the fair value of the make whole provision contained within our senior notes using a monte carlo simulation model to be million  which included million at the time of conversion of the senior notes into senior convertible notes in january and million upon exercise of the initial investors purchase option in april this fair value of the make whole 
table of contents provision  which was recorded as a derivative liability  was adjusted quarterly for changes in fair value during the periods that the senior convertible notes were outstanding  with the corresponding charge or credit to change in fair value of derivative liability 
these adjustments resulted in a loss on the change in fair value of derivative liability of million for the year ended december  since all the senior convertible notes were converted in july  no derivative liability remains 
net gain on bond repurchase we recorded a million net gain on the bond repurchase related to the repurchase of million of subordinated convertible notes in for million 
the net gain is comprised of an aggregated gross gain of million  less the write off of million of deferred finance costs 
gain on sale of biodefense assets  net during the third quarter of  we sold certain of our non core assets  including compounds  assays and other intellectual property related to the development of antiviral drugs targeting the smallpox virus and viral hemorrhagic fever viruses  which resulted in a net gain on sale of million 
interest income interest income for years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
interest income increased primarily due to investments of the cash received from the issuance of common stock in december prior to that increase in cash  interest income had not fluctuated materially as interest rate increases had offset our then lower invested balances 
interest expense for the years ended december  in thousands interest expense on subordinated converible notes interest expense on senior notes interest expense on senior convertible notes amortization of finance costs amortization of debt discount beneficial conversion feature other interest total interest expense interest expense on notes includes interest on all our notes outstanding and decreased over due to varying principal amounts outstanding during the periods 
amortization of finance costs and debt discount in relates primarily to the senior convertible notes issued in january and april  which were fully converted to common stock during the year  and in relates primarily to the senior notes issued in october the beneficial conversion feature related to the automatic conversions of the senior convertible notes in june and july and is the result of the fair value of the shares of common stock on the commitment date exceeding the stock value as defined by the auto conversion provisions 
see note of the consolidated financial statements regarding the automatic conversion 
on march   the company redeemed the remaining million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes for million 
this eliminated the company s long term debt that was outstanding at december  we will take a charge of million related to this payment in the first quarter of  which represents a loss of million and the write off of deferred finance costs of million 

table of contents income tax benefit our effective income tax benefit rate was for the year ended december  our income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  includes million to record our deferred tax assets by reducing our valuation allowance 
this was necessary as we believe we will utilize a portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards  among other things 
additionally  we recorded income tax expense of million  based on a combined federal and state estimated annual effective tax rate of 
the estimated annual effective tax rate was based on our estimated taxable income for  which includes  among other things  the utilization of a portion of our available net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
since we established our net deferred tax assets in  we recorded a million income tax benefit  as described above 
we currently do not anticipate income tax benefits of this magnitude in the foreseeable future 
we expect that future periods will include taxes at a higher rate than the effective rate for due to the recognition of the deferred tax assets in  we expect an effective income tax rate of in we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis  and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
should we further reduce the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in future years  a tax benefit would be recognized

research and development expenses decreased approximately million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  as a result of our reduction in headcount and operational costs resulting from our restructuring announced in january our research and development expenses were divided between our research and development programs in the following manner for the years ended december  in thousands direct core programs cmv hcv direct non core programs common cold cema indirect development discovery research total direct core programs in the year ended december   we incurred million in direct expenses related to our cmv program 
during the year ended december   we initiated two phase clinical trials with maribavir to evaluate the potential for drug interactions and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of maribavir in subjects with renal impairment  respectively  and we initiated one phase clinical study involving cmv seropositive subjects who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
we had no material expenses under this program in the year ended december   as we did not acquire the rights for its development and commercialization until august during the year ended december   we incurred million of direct costs related to development activities of our hcv program  which increased million from the year ended december  these costs are net of payments from wyeth made in accordance with our cost sharing arrangement 
during  the primary drivers of these costs were phase clinical trials for hcv during the year ended december   the primary drivers of million in costs were phase clinical trials for a previous lead product candidate and predevelopment activities on backup compounds  and were nearly offset by a million credit related to the amendment of our agreement with wyeth

we ceased these development activities in connection with our january restructuring and have no comparable direct costs 
indirect expenses in the year ended december   we incurred million of indirect expenses related to our development activities  which decreased million from million in the year ended december  the decrease of million was due primarily to the reduced headcount resulting from the january restructuring

intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization was million for the year ended december  intangible amortization is the result of the vancocin product rights acquisition in the fourth quarter of we had a valuation study performed by a third party  based on information provided by management  to determine the allocation of the estimated purchase price of the vancocin acquisition among the intangible assets acquired as well as their estimated amortization period 
in september  we paid gsk a million license fee in connection with our agreement for the worldwide rights excluding japan to maribavir  or vp  an inhibitor of cmv 
this fee was recognized as an acquisition of technology rights and was expensed during interest and other expenses gains interest income for the year ended december  of million decreased million from interest income of million for the year ended december  this was due to lower invested balances 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million increased million compared to million in interest expense from the year ended december  due to the interest and amortization of financing costs from the issuance of the senior notes in october 
table of contents liquidity we expect that our near term sources of revenue will arise from vancocin product sales and milestone and license fee payments that we may receive from wyeth and schering plough if agreed upon events under our agreements with each of these companies are achieved 
however  we cannot predict what the actual sales of vancocin will be in the future  and there are no assurances that the events that require payments to us under the wyeth and schering plough arrangements will be achieved 
in addition  while demand for vancocin exceeded our estimates in  there are no assurances that such demand will continue 
our ability to generate positive cash flow is also impacted by the timing of anticipated events in our cmv and hcv programs  including results from clinical trials  the results of our product development efforts  and variations from our estimate of future direct and indirect expenses 
while we anticipate that revenues from vancocin will continue to generate positive cash flow and should allow us to fund substantially all of our ongoing development and other operating costs  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  million of which was used in march to redeem the remaining million of long term debt that was outstanding at december  at december   the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate on our short term investments was 
during  we funded the million purchase price for the vancocin acquisition through the use of million from our cash reserves and the proceeds from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
the senior notes and the warrants were automatically exchanged for senior convertible notes following stockholder approval of the issuance of the senior convertible notes on january  in april  the initial investors in the senior notes exercised their purchase option and acquired an additional million of the senior convertible notes with identical terms 
by september   the entire principal balance of the senior convertible notes was converted into common stock 
for more information regarding the senior convertible notes  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overall cash flows during the year ended december   we generated million of net cash from operating activities  primarily from the cash contribution of vancocin  our first commercial product  which includes the effects of net income and building inventory and million from the sale of inventory to schering plough  offset by million in cash payments related to the make whole provisions on the senior convertible notes 
we also received million from investing activities  which is the net result of the release of million of restricted investments  the million paid to lilly for contingent consideration  and the decrease in cash held in short term investments 
our net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this is primarily the net result of million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock completed in december  the million of net proceeds from the issuance of senior convertible notes and the use of million for the repurchase of subordinated convertible notes 
operating cash inflows we began to receive cash inflows from the sale of vancocin in january we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive material net cash inflows from our product candidates currently under development 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including the achievement of milestones and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by efforts of our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug 
table of contents candidates  our collaborative partners may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  when and if approved  or they may not successfully market these products 
operating cash outflows the cash flows we have used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities  marketing and business development efforts  general and administrative expenses  and servicing our debt 
future cash flows will also include income tax payments 
bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase  phase  and phase clinical trials and fda approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because our product candidates are currently in the clinical stage of development  there are a variety of events that could occur during the development process that will dictate the course we must take with our drug development efforts and the cost of these efforts 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs that we will incur through the commercialization of any product candidate 
the most significant uses of our near term operating development cash outflows are as described below 
for each of our development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility and other overhead costs 
direct expenses core development programs cmv program from the date we in licensed maribavir through december   we incurred million of direct costs in connection with this program  including the acquisition fee of million paid to gsk for the rights to maribavir in september during  we expect maribavir related activities to include completion of the phase study that we initiated during july  as well as the continuation of a series of phase clinical pharmacology studies to support the clinical development program 
depending on the outcome of the phase study  additional clinical development activities may be pursued 
the results of this phase study will significantly impact the timing and the amount of expenses  including potential milestone payments to gsk  that we will incur related to this program in future periods 
however  if our cmv program progresses into phase clinical development in  we expect our expenses in for this program to be substantially higher than in in addition  discussions with the fda regarding these future studies may impact the timing  nature and cost of future planned studies 
we are solely responsible for the cost of developing our cmv product candidate 
should we achieve certain product development events  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to gsk  the licensor of maribavir 
hcv program from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for compounds in this program that are currently active through december   we incurred million in direct expenses for the predevelopment and development activities relating to such compounds 
these costs are net of contractual cost sharing arrangements between wyeth and us 
wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses 
during  the planned activities include phase testing of our hcv product candidate  hcv  in combination with pegylated interferon 
if these data are supportive  we and wyeth anticipate initiation of one or more phase studies in the results of the planned studies  along with other predevelopment activities performed during the year  will significantly impact the timing and amount of expenses we will incur related to this program in future periods 
in addition  discussions with the fda regarding these future studies may impact the timing  nature and cost of future planned studies 

table of contents should we achieve certain product development events  wyeth is required to pay us certain cash milestones and to purchase  in cash  our common stock pursuant to terms of our collaboration agreement 
based on the activities planned by wyeth and us  there is the potential to achieve one of these milestones in however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving this milestone during this timeframe  or at all 
vancocin and c 
difficile related we acquired vancocin in november and have spent approximately million in direct research and development costs related to vancocin or on related c 
difficile activities since acquisition 
during  we expect our research and development activities in the field of c 
difficile to increase significantly and we expect this increase to result in additional direct costs above levels 
direct expenses non core development programs common cold from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for the intranasal formulation of pleconaril through december   we incurred million in direct expenses 
we did not incur any significant direct expenses in connection with this program in  nor will we in the future  as schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
in november  we entered into a license agreement with schering plough under which schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
schering plough paid us an initial license fee of million in december and purchased our existing inventory of bulk drug substance for an additional million in january we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain targeted regulatory and commercial events  as well as royalties on schering plough s sales of intranasal pleconaril in the licensed territories 
business development activities through december   we paid an acquisition price of million  paid million related to additional purchase price consideration tied to product sales see recent events  vancocin capsules above and note of the consolidated financial statements and incurred million of fees and expenses in connection with the vancocin acquisition 
we also paid an acquisition fee of million paid to gsk in for the rights to maribavir 
in addition  we intend to seek to acquire additional products or product candidates 
the costs associated with acquiring any additional product or product candidate can vary substantially based upon market size of the product  the commercial effort required for the product  the product s current stage of development  and actual and potential generic and non generic competition for the product  among other factors 
due to the variability of the cost of acquiring a product candidate  it is not feasible to predict what our actual acquisition costs would be  if any  however  the costs could be substantial 
debt service requirements subordinated convertible notes on march   we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes for million 
this eliminated all long term debt that was outstanding at december  see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our subordinated convertible notes 

table of contents contractual obligations future contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  are as follows contractual obligations total year or less years years more than years in thousands current portion of long term debt minimum purchase requirements operating leases total this table does not include any milestone payments under our agreement with gsk in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
similarly  it does not include any additional payments due to lilly in connection with the vancocin acquisition  as the amount and timing of future additional payments are not determinable 
under the terms of the agreement with lilly  lilly is entitled to additional payments on net sales of vancocin through the additional payments to be paid to lilly are calculated as follows payment on net sales between million payment on net sales between million through payment on net sales between million no additional payments are due to lilly on sales of vancocin below or above the sales levels reflected in the above table 
we will account for the future payments as contingent consideration and will record an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related intangible asset and a cumulative adjustment to the intangible amortization upon achievement of the related sales milestones 
assuming the maximum threshold is met at the end of each year  the cumulative amortization adjustment would be million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the event we develop any product line extensions  revive discontinued vancomycin product lines injectable or oral solution  make improvements of existing products  or expand the label to cover new indications  lilly would receive an additional royalty on net sales on these additional products for a predetermined time period 
represents principal balance of million as of december  for the subordinated convertible notes 
these notes were redeemed on march  for million and are no longer outstanding 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
represents contractual commitment at december  as part of our manufacturing agreement with lilly  as amended  we have certain minimum purchase requirements of vancocin for a period of time less than one year  on a rolling basis 
we are not contractually obligated to any amount of purchases past this time period  and cannot reasonably estimate the amount for which we may be obligated in the future 
excludes amounts related to our november amendment to our manufacturing agreement with lilly as these amounts are reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
this table does not include various agreements that we have entered into for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services due to the cancelable nature of the services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 

table of contents we currently lease  square feet in a facility located in exton  pennsylvania for our marketing  development and corporate activities under an operating lease expiring in with million in future rental obligations 
operating leases also includes equipment leases of million 
capital resources while we anticipate that revenues from vancocin will continue to generate positive cash flow and should allow us to fund substantially all of our ongoing development and other operating costs  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
should we need financing  we would seek to access the public or private equity or debt markets  enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into other alternative financing arrangements that may become available to us 
financing we have an effective form s universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the potential additional issuance of up to approximately million of our securities 
the registration statement provides us with the flexibility to determine the type of security we choose to sell  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities  as well as the ability to time such sales when market conditions are favorable 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
additionally  wyeth is required to purchase our common stock at the time of successful completion of certain product development events pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement 
however  in the event we are not able to successfully achieve the product development events  this additional financing would not be available to us 
if we raise additional capital by accessing debt markets  the terms and pricing for these financings may be much more favorable to the new lenders than the terms obtained from our prior lenders 
these financings also may require liens on certain of our assets that may limit our flexibility 
additional equity or debt financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our operating results  our inability to achieve regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  our inability to generate revenue through our existing collaborative agreements  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce patent claims and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
however  we consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows product sales product revenue is recorded upon delivery to the wholesaler  when title has passed 
product demand from wholesalers during a given period may not correlate with prescription demand for the product in that period 
as a result  we periodically estimate and evaluate the wholesalers inventory position 
if we believe these levels are too high based on prescription demand and that there may be excess channel inventory for our product  we may not process wholesaler orders until these levels are reduced 
after analysis of our estimated channel inventory  we may defer recognition of revenue on product that has been delivered 
from acquisition in november through december   we have not deferred any product sales 
we establish provisions for sales discounts  chargebacks  product returns and rebates 
these provisions are primarily based upon the history of vancocin  including both lilly and our ownership periods 
we currently have no contracts with private third party payors  such as hmo s 
we do have contractual arrangements with governmental agencies  including medicaid 
we establish provisions for chargebacks and rebates related to these contracts based upon historical experience of government agencies market share and governmental contractual prices 
product return accruals are estimated based on vancocin s history of damage and product expiration returns 
since actual experience could vary significantly from expectations  we periodically analyze estimated channel inventory  historical governmental usage  potential expiration of unused product and quality assurance indicators to confirm our monthly provisions appear reasonable and within an acceptable range 
although from acquisition to date  we have not had a material adjustment to our sales related accruals  changes in usage of vancocin could result in material impacts on future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we review our fixed and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows in determining whether an impairment exists and in measuring the current fair value of the asset 
these assumptions are subjective and could result in a material impact on operating results in the period of impairment 
the company has not recognized any impairment during the year ended december  on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has impaired the value of the assets or modified their estimated useful lives 
this evaluation has not resulted in a change to the useful life of our intangible assets during the year ended december  we review our short term investments on a periodic basis for other than temporary impairments 
this review is subjective as it requires management to evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred in that period that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
as of december   we have deemed our unrealized loss not to be other than temporary

income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on expected pre tax earnings  existing statutory tax rates  limitations on the use of tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  tax planning strategies and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact the income tax position in the year of resolution 
our current tax liability is presented in the consolidated balance sheet within income taxes payable 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets  which included the effects of federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards of million  capitalized research and development costs of million and other items of million 
these assets are offset by a million valuation allowance as our ability to estimate long term future taxable income with a high level of certainty is limited 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences becomes deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
when considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  we consider the level of past and future taxable income  the utilization of the carryforwards and other factors 
based upon these considerations  we reduced our valuation allowance by million in the fourth quarter of as management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of a portion of these deferred tax assets  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  this valuation adjustment reduced our effective tax rate 
we expect that future periods will include income taxes at a higher rate 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
should we further reduce the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets  a current year tax benefit will be recognized and future periods would then include income taxes at a higher rate than the effective rate in the period that the adjustment is made 
as our business evolves  we may face additional issues that will require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are primarily comprised of a mix of us corporate debt  government securities and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
our primary investment objective is the preservation of principal  while at the same time maximizing the generation of investment income 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in cash equivalents such as treasury bills and money market funds and fixed income securities such as us government and agency securities  municipal securities  taxable municipals  and corporate notes while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
historically  we have typically invested in financial instruments with maturities of less than one year 
the carrying amount  which approximates fair value  and the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate of our investment portfolio at december   was approximately million and  respectively 
a one percent change in the interest rate would have resulted in a million impact to interest income for the year ended december  
table of contents at december   we had outstanding million of our subordinated convertible notes 
the subordinated convertible notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the subordinated convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears  and could be redeemed by us  at certain premiums over the principal amount 
at december   the fair value of our subordinated convertible notes was approximately million  based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of our subordinated convertible notes is dependent upon  among other factors  the fair value of our common stock and prevailing market interest rates 
on march   we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes 
this eliminated all long term debt that was outstanding on december
