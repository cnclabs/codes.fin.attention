table of contents the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed ffo as a relative non gaap financial measure of performance of a reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo is defined by nareit and is used by the company as follows net earnings computed in accordance with gaap plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  excluding gains or including losses on the disposition of real estate held for investment  and the company s share of these items from the company s unconsolidated partnerships 
ffo is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of operating performance of real estate companies 
ffo does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of operating performance of an equity reit because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as an operating performance measure 
the company s computation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo used by other equity reits  and therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the company has earnings from discontinued operations in each of its segments  investment assets and inventory assets  real estate held for investment and real estate held for sale 
all property dispositions from the company s investment segment are classified as discontinued operations 
in addition  certain properties in the company s inventory segment that have generated revenues before disposition are classified as discontinued operations 
these inventory properties have not historically been classified as discontinued operations  therefore  prior period comparable consolidated financial statements have been restated to include these properties in its earnings from discontinued operations 
these adjustments resulted in a decrease in the company s reported total revenues and total and per share earnings from continuing operations and an increase in the company s earnings from discontinued operations 
however  the company s total and per share net earnings available to common stockholders are not affected

a summary of the company s accounting policies and procedures are included in note of the company s consolidated financial statements

real estate held for investment and lease accounting 
the company records the acquisition of real estate at cost  including acquisition and closing costs 
the cost of properties developed by the company includes direct and indirect costs of construction  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy 
real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance and repairs 
the leases are accounted for using either the operating or the direct financing method 
such methods are described below operating method leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate 
revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses including depreciation are charged to operations as incurred 
buildings are depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives generally to years 
leasehold interests are amortized on the straight line method over the terms of their respective leases 
when scheduled rentals vary during the lease term  income is recognized on a straight line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease 
accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents  which vary during the lease term  and the income recognized on a straight line basis 
direct financing method leases accounted for using the direct financing method are recorded at their net investment which at the inception of the lease generally represents the cost of the property 
unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the company s net investment in the leases 
the company periodically assesses its real estate assets for possible impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset  including any accrued rental income  may not be recoverable 
management considers current market conditions and tenant credit analysis in determining whether the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset should be assessed 
when an assessment is warranted  management determines whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  including the residual value of the real estate  with the carrying cost of the individual asset 
if an impairment is indicated  a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
intangible assets and liabilities 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  building and tenant improvements based on the determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management uses the as if vacant fair value of a property provided by a qualified appraiser 

table of contents in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the company s leases do not currently include fixed rate renewal periods 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
the value of in place leases exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off
