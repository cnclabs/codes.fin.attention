all references to years relate to the calendar year ended december of the particular year 
overview since our initial public offering in  our net sales have steadily increased from million in to  million in  which equates to a compound annual growth rate of for this period 
although we cannot predict future results with certainty  our long term goal is to capitalize on global market opportunities for each of our key product categories 
we are committed to our growth strategies of enhancing the retail productivity of our customers  leveraging our brands in international markets  further developing our product categories  selectively broadening our retail distribution channels and expanding the global awareness of our brands through license agreements 
with our well developed sourcing and distribution infrastructure and proven design and product development team  we believe that we are well positioned for future long term growth 
highlights for the year ended december  are as follows net sales increased million  or  to  million in from  million in excluding changes in currency exchange rates  net sales increased 
our sales growth is largely attributable to increased sales by our international businesses  particularly our european and other international businesses  which include our direct business in japan and korea and our international distributor markets worldwide 
from a product categorical perspective  our sales growth was entirely attributable to increased sales of sportswear and footwear 
as a result of the continued sales product mix shift during  sportswear sales outpaced outerwear sales to become our largest product category representing million  or of net sales 
our backlog for the spring selling season increased million  or  to million as of september  from million as of september  spring orders increased in all key geographic markets  particularly in international markets 
increased sportswear backlog continues to be the key driver of spring order growth 
although we cannot predict future results with certainty  our reported backlog is one indicator of our anticipated growth rates for the spring selling season 
many factors  however  could cause actual sales to differ materially from reported future order backlog 
moreover  our spring backlog is not indicative of  and should not be utilized in forecasting  sales beyond the spring selling season 
for the year  gross profit decreased basis points to in from in this contraction was due to a higher mix of sportswear and footwear sales that have lower gross margins than outerwear  intra product mix shift within the outerwear product category  increased inbound air freight costs and lower margins on close out product sales

unit sales quantities increased in each product category except outerwear and accessories 
net sales from outerwear decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was the result of weakness in our outerwear business in the united states and canada 
outerwear sales growth was strong in other international while european outerwear sales also increased 
the decrease in outerwear sales in the united states was primarily attributable to the negative effect of poor sell through last fall that resulted primarily from unseasonably warm weather conditions  an increasingly competitive outerwear market and an increasingly challenging retail environment 
the outerwear sales growth in other international was the result of strong sales growth in our international distributor business as well as our direct businesses in japan and korea 
the growth in these markets was partially the result of favorable weather conditions  which drove the retail sell through of outerwear products 

table of contents net sales from sportswear increased million  or  to million in from million in as a result of continued strength in our sportswear business and the decrease in outerwear sales  sportswear is now our largest product category  representing of total sales

europe s direct net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding changes in currency exchange rates  europe s net sales increased 
sales increased across all product categories in europe in led by footwear  followed by outerwear  sportswear  equipment and accessories 
footwear sales growth resulted from increased sales to large account customers particularly in france and spain  while footwear sales decreased in germany and the netherlands primarily due to difficult economic conditions in those countries 
the increase in outerwear sales was largely attributable to increased sales resulting from the acquisition of our distributor in switzerland  tecnisport sa  in july of with the acquisition of tecnisport  we began recognizing sales at end customer direct prices  rather than the lower independent distributor prices that applied prior to the acquisition under our distributor agreement with tecnisport 
excluding this acquisition  outerwear sales would have been flat because of decreased sales in germany and the netherlands as well as higher than normal carryover inventory by our customers from the fall season  offset by increased sales to large account customers

sales of accessories also decreased 
the decrease in canadian outerwear sales was predominantly the result of decreased sales to large account customers that were negatively affected by an increasingly challenging retail environment  as well as unfavorable weather conditions during fall resulting in excess inventory carryover by our customers 
late inbound receipts of fall inventory also contributed to the decrease in outerwear sales 

table of contents net sales from other international  which includes our direct business in japan and korea and our international distributor markets worldwide  increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding changes in currency exchange rates  other international sales increased 
sales growth for other international was led by our international distributors  followed by our korean and japanese businesses 
net sales increased across all product categories  led by outerwear  followed by footwear  sportswear  accessories and equipment 
sales growth by our international distributors resulted from increased sales by our distributors in russia and china which continue to expand columbia s retail presence in those countries 
the increase in korean sales resulted from the opening of new stores and our decision to begin operating mountain hardwear s korean business directly rather than through a distributor 
japanese sales growth resulted from increased sales by sports chain and specialty stores that was  in part  assisted by favorable weather conditions 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the continued shift in our sales product mix both between and within product categories and  to a lesser degree  increased inbound air freight costs and lower margins on close out product sales in the first half of the year 
these unfavorable gross profit impacts were partially offset by an improvement in our foreign currency hedge rates 
product sales mix continued to have a negative effect on gross profits as sales of our sportswear and footwear products increased while sales of outerwear products decreased for the year 
in general  our outerwear products carry higher gross profit margins than sportswear and footwear products 
for the year  outerwear sales represented of total net sales compared to of total net sales in sportswear and footwear sales increased to and of total net sales in from and in  respectively 
shifts in intra product mix also had an unfavorable effect on outerwear gross profits as a result of a shift in sales volumes to lower margin product styles 
to a lesser degree  our gross profits were also negatively affected by an increase in inbound air freight costs 
we incurred incrementally higher air freight charges in the third quarter of this year compared to the same period last year in order to timely fulfill our customer orders due to various isolated supply chain issues 
an increase in close out sales at lower gross margins compared to also had an unfavorable effect on our consolidated gross profits 
this increase in close out sales at lower gross margins resulted from the sale of fall and spring close out product in the united states 
fall close out sales increased due to excess inventory resulting from unseasonably warm weather during the increase in spring close out sales primarily resulted from unseasonably cool weather conditions in the early part of the spring season in the united states 
the unfavorable gross profit impact from shifts in product sales mix  increased inbound air freight and lower gross margins on close out sales were partially offset by an improvement in foreign currency exchange rates for spring and fall compared to spring and fall because our global supply of inventory is generally purchased with us dollars  our foreign businesses benefited from the decrease in value of the us dollar compared to this favorable gross profit impact has been most noticeable in our european and canadian businesses 
our gross profits may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry because some include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 
we  like others  have chosen to include these expenses as a component of selling  general and administrative expense

the increase in personnel costs was attributable to increased headcount at our corporate and subsidiary locations to support future sales growth as well as increased headcount at our kentucky distribution center 
depreciation and amortization included in sg a totaled million for compared to million for the increase in depreciation expense is directly related to our new distribution center in kentucky 
net licensing income as our licensees have become more established in the marketplace with the sale of branded products  our licensing arrangements have produced highly profitable income for us 
we derive net licensing income by licensing our trademarks across a range of categories that complement our current product offerings 
for  we recognized licensing income from fifteen licensees 
products distributed by our licensees included socks  bags  packs  leather  eyewear  watches  camping gear  home furnishings  bicycles and other accessories

unit sales quantities also increased within each of our product categories 
we continued to experience a shift in our sales product mix as sales of sportswear and footwear increased faster than our other product categories 
net sales from outerwear increased million  or  to million in from million in outerwear sales growth was primarily attributable to increased shipments of outerwear in europe and our other international businesses 
european sales of outerwear increased in all key product classes and distribution channels  primarily resulting from increased sales to large account customers 
the increase in sales to large account customers was primarily the result of certain key customers in france and spain increasing their 
table of contents purchases of well known international product brands 
the decline of outerwear sales in the united states and canada partially offset the increase in international sales of outerwear 
net sales from sportswear increased million  or  to million in from million in sportswear sales increased in all global markets in  led by strong gains in the united states followed by europe  other international and canada 
the increase in sales of sportswear in the united states was the result of increased sales across all major distribution channels and product classes  including pants  shorts  sweaters and knitted and woven tops 
we attribute the sales increase  in part  to an improvement in the segmentation and differentiation of our products for specific distribution channels our high end performance products highly technical products generally sold in specialty stores  our moderate products technical products generally sold in sporting goods stores  and our most broadly distributed products less technical  core products generally sold in department stores 
we believe that increased differentiation of our products allows our retail customers to better target their specific customers 
shipments of sportswear to the department store channel were particularly strong throughout the year in the united states 
in europe  the increase in sportswear sales was primarily attributable to increased shipments of pants  shorts and woven tops 
net sales from footwear increased million  or  to million in from million in footwear sales increased in each of our major markets  led by the united states  followed by europe  canada and other international

net sales in the united states increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in net sales in the united states was the result of increased sales from sportswear  footwear and equipment partially offset by decreases in the outerwear and accessories categories 
increased shipments of sportswear in the united states were the most significant factor contributing to our consolidated sales growth for the year 
sportswear sales increased in all key product classes and within each major distribution channel 
footwear sales increased in all key product classes led by boots and sandals 
from a distribution channel perspective  footwear sales increased in all sales channels in the united states except the department store channel 
sales of outerwear decreased as a result of several factors  including the continued consumer trend toward purchasing lighter weight products generally selling at lower prices  unseasonable winter weather conditions during the fourth quarter of  and a challenging competitive environment 
the weakness in our youth outerwear category also affected outerwear sales during the year

net sales increased across all product categories  led by outerwear  followed by sportswear  accessories  equipment and footwear 
outerwear and sportswear sales growth was particularly strong in our international distributor based markets  while our business in korea contributed to the increase in sales of accessories 
footwear sales increased less in other international than in other geographic regions primarily due to the poor sell through of cold weather footwear in russia in as a result of mild weather conditions 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the continued shift in our sales product mix both between and within product categories 
the unfavorable gross profit effect of shifts in our sales product mix was partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as foreign currencies in our direct markets appreciated against the us dollar 
a shift in our sales product mix from our traditional outerwear products to sportswear and footwear continued to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit throughout this shift in sales product mix was anticipated due to our growth strategy to further develop and expand our product categories 
moreover  as a result of our growth strategies  increases in sales of sportswear and footwear outpaced sales growth from outerwear 
sales product mix affects our gross profits because our outerwear products generally carry higher gross profits than other product categories 
in  outerwear sales represented of net sales compared to of net sales 
sportswear and footwear sales represented and of net sales in  respectively  compared to and of net sales in  respectively 
in the future  we anticipate the shift in sales product mix will continue to exert pressure on our gross profits 
our gross profit also decreased due to shifts in sales product mix within our product categories 
shifts in sales product mix is a factor within each of our product categories especially the outerwear category where there has been a general consumer trend to purchase lighter weight  lower margin outerwear products and heavier sportswear products  such as fleece sweaters  vests and pullovers 
the unfavorable impacts on gross profit from product mix shifts were partially offset by the appreciation of many foreign currencies against the us dollar 
since our global supply of inventory is generally purchased with us dollars  our foreign businesses have benefited from the decreasing value of the us dollar 
this favorable gross profit impact has been most noticeable in our european  canadian and japanese businesses 
our gross profits may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry because some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales

the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million increase in personnel and an million increase in travel and other operating expenses  including professional fees  which were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expense 
the increase in personnel costs was partially attributable to increased headcount and contract labor to support increased unit sales volume and our new distribution center in kentucky 
increased headcount at our corporate and subsidiary offices to support the higher levels of sales also resulted in increased personnel spending 
the increase in travel expense was a function of increased headcount as well as increased international travel as our business matures outside the united states 
professional fees increased due to increased legal  audit and consulting fees  many of which were associated with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
depreciation and amortization included in sg a totaled million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily related to some assets in the united states becoming fully depreciated 
net licensing income as our licensees have continued to gain momentum in the market place with the sale of our branded products  our licensing arrangements have produced highly profitable income for us 
we derive net licensing income from income that we earn through licensing our trademarks across a range of categories that complement our current product offerings

liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing funding requirements are to finance working capital and the continued growth of the business 
we financed our operations for the year ended december  primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was the result of an increase in accounts payable and income taxes payable  coupled with a smaller increase in accounts receivable compared to the increase in accounts receivable as of december  our primary capital requirements are for working capital  investing activities associated with the expansion of our global operations and general corporate needs 
net cash used in investing activities was million in 
table of contents compared to million in in  our investing activities primarily consisted of million used for capital expenditures and million used for the acquisition of the net assets of our swiss distributor  tecnisport 
capital expenditures mostly related to the enhancement of our rivergate distribution center in portland  oregon and the expansion of our european distribution center in cambrai  france 
in  our investing activities primarily consisted of million used for capital expenditures  including approximately related to the construction of our distribution center in kentucky 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million in in  net cash used in financing activities was for the repurchase of common stock at an aggregate price of million and the net repayment of long term debt of million  offset by the net proceeds of notes payable of million and the proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million 
in  net cash used in financing activities was for the repurchase of common stock at an aggregate price of million and the repayment of long term debt of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million 
to fund our domestic working capital requirements  we have available unsecured revolving lines of credit with aggregate seasonal limits ranging from million to million  of which million to million is committed 
at december   no domestic balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines in place guaranteed by us with a combined limit of approximately million at december  at december   million was outstanding under these lines of credit 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash and cash provided by operations 
if the need arises for additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third calendar quarter 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments to wholesale customers for the fall outerwear season 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 
the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ending december  thereafter total debt repayments other operating leases non related parties related party excludes interest 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for interest terms 
other amounts primarily include installment payments on purchase obligations made in the ordinary course of business for non product purchases 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required  including any imputed interest  by legally binding contracts and agreements 
these operating lease commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under gaap 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we maintain unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit with a combined limit of million at december   available for issuing letters of credit 
at december   we had letters of credit outstanding of million issued for purchase orders for inventory 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as a result of our international sales  production and funding requirements 
our policy is to use financial instruments to reduce market risk where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
foreign currency and interest rate transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from production purchases  intercompany transactions and other costs from exchange rate movements 
we manage this risk primarily by using forward exchange contracts and options to hedge various firm as well as anticipated commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed  transactions that we hedge carry a high level of certainty and are expected to be recognized within one year 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
the fair value of our hedging contracts was favorable by approximately million at december  and unfavorable by approximately million at december  a change in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value  resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have no exposure due to interest rate changes on our million and million of long term debt at december  and  respectively 
we do  however  have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit because interest on those lines floats and is based on libor and other interest rate indices 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the provision for potential excess  close out and slow moving inventory  product warranty and income taxes 
management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates and the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these 
table of contents discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we record wholesale and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some countries outside of the united states where title passes upon receipt by the customer  predominantly where we sell directly in western europe  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to four days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that had been established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such a determination 
over the three year period ending december   our actual annual sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers have been less than two percent of net sales 
the allowance for outstanding sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates for the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  credit insurance coverage  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance could be required 
if we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we made the determination 
inventory obsolescence and product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory and product warranty costs 
we identify our excess inventory  a component of which is planned  and evaluate our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
when evaluating our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical claim rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
if we determine smaller or larger reserves are appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period we made the determination 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated effective rate 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or cumulative effect of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payment to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r is effective for calendar year companies for all stock based awards granted on or after january  in addition  calendar year companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of january  we are required to apply sfas no 
r as of january  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective 
table of contents date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we had historically accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant effect on our future results of operations  although we do not expect that it will have a significant impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted with certainty at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future  but we would anticipate compensation expense in for stock options to approximate historical pro forma amounts as presented in note  under the caption stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
although we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets an amendment of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no

sfas no 
specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange
