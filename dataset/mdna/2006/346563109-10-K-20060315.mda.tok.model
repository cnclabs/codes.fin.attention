item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research products and from our advisory services and events available through what we refer to as research  data  consulting  and community offerings 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services offered through our data  consulting and community products and services to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
consequently  changes in the number and value of client contracts  both net decreases as well as net increases  impact our revenues and other results over a period of several months 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization and amortization of intangible assets 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  and it includes the costs of salaries  bonuses  and related benefits for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions 
overhead costs are allocated over these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
amortization of intangible assets represents the cost of amortizing acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships  research content and trademarks 
in february  we acquired giga information group  inc giga  a global technology advisory firm  pursuant to a cash tender offer and second step merger 
the results of giga s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since february  as part of the acquisition of giga  we acquired an equity investment in gigagroup sa gigagroup 
gigagroup was created in through the spin off of giga s french subsidiary  and held an exclusive agreement to distribute all giga research and certain services in france  belgium  netherlands  luxemburg  switzerland  italy  spain  and portugal 
in november  we acquired the assets of gigagroup 
the results of gigagroup s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since november  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time but not including advisory only contracts  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  we calculate client retention as the number of client companies who renewed with memberships as a percentage of those that would have expired 
we calculate dollar retention as a percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month fiscal period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
we calculate enrichment as a percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the 
table of contents corresponding expiring contracts 
client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows absolute percentage year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease in millions agreement value client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients year ended december  absolute percentage increase increase in millions agreement value client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients the increase in agreement value from to is primarily due to an increase in the number of clients 
the increase in client retention and dollar retention from to reflects an improving economic environment 
the decrease in enrichment from to reflects more clients renewing memberships at the same level as the prior year  coupled with an increase in advisory only contracts purchased by clients during the membership term and not in connection with the renewal 
the increase in agreement value from to is primarily due to increases in average contract sizes and in the number of clients 
the increase in client retention  dollar retention and enrichment from to reflects an improving economic environment 
reorganizations since july  we have reorganized our workforce and consolidated our facilities several times in response to market conditions and in connection with the integration of giga and gigagroup in august and january  respectively 
a summary of the key items related to the reorganizations is as follows january  july  august  january  in thousands workforce reduction facility consolidation and other related costs depreciable assets total reorganization charge accrued severance and facility consolidation costs as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing research  performing advisory services  and hosting events 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  the estimate of which requires us to make estimates of such fair values 
the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory service revenues are recognized during the period in which the services are performed 
events revenues are recognized upon completion of the events 
in certain cases  where estimates of fair value cannot be made for events or advisory services  the amounts are recognized ratably and included in research services revenues 
while our historical business practice has been to offer membership contracts with a non cancelable term  effective april   we offer clients a money back guarantee  which gives them the right to cancel their membership contracts prior to the end of the contract term 
for contracts that can be terminated during the contract term  any refund would be issued on a pro rata basis only 
reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory revenue 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses that are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management makes judgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of our customers were to improve  the allowances may be reduced accordingly 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related companies and equity investment funds 
these investments are in companies that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies which consists primarily of reviewing the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we have goodwill and identified intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare the reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november th as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships  research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on an accelerated basis which matches the periods in which those cash flows are estimated to be produced 
tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment  which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our identifiable intangible and long lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards primarily from stock option exercises and the acquisition of giga 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and before the carryforwards expire 
although realization is not assured  based upon the level of our historical taxable income and our estimates of future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and before the carryforwards expire  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if our estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward periods are incorrect

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal and state government obligations and corporate obligations  with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity except for any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio

on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
to date  the effect of changes in currency exchange rates has not had a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
accordingly  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations that the euro  or other foreign currencies  will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material
