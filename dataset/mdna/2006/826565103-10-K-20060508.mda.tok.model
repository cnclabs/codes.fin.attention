we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of our board products and chipsets to corporate customers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who in turn incorporate our products into technologies that are sold into the consumer electronics market 
we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our oems and receive substantially all of our revenues based on purchase orders 
we work with both oems and end users of our products to better understand the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  and inventories 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we derive revenues from three principal sources product sales  product development contracts and service contracts 
revenues from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as our shipping terms are fob shipping point  except that revenues are deferred when management cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectibility is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable generally upon resale by customers or sell through basis 
allowances for sales returns  price protection and warranty costs are recorded at the time that revenues are recognized 
in fiscal  we began recognizing revenues from our primary us distributor on a sell through basis 
this practice resulted from significant sales returns  which we accepted from the distributor outside of the terms of the distribution agreement 
under terms of a distribution agreement entered into with the distributor in fiscal  we granted the distributor the right of return and price protection  which allows the distributor to return any product  which is in the original packaging  for full credit up to days after the earlier of the agreement expiration or early termination 
the price protection provision allows the distributor to receive a credit for the difference between the original price and the reduced price of our products within their inventory 
although the returns are not frequent in nature  returns from this distributor cannot be reasonably estimated 
consequently  pursuant to the above policy  revenue from this distributor is recognized upon resale to the distributor s end customers 
revenues from product development agreements were recognized in fiscal  and when billed  earned  and collection was assured 
during fiscal  the company classified development costs related to such agreements as cost of revenues 
during fiscal and  the company classified development costs related to such agreements as research and development expenses as the associated effort expended in providing development revenue was resident in the r d function 
development revenues were approximately million   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenues from service contracts consist of fees for providing engineering support services  which are recognized ratably over the contract term 
expenses related to support service revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses  as the engineering support associated with service contract revenue is resident in the sales and marketing function 
support service revenues were   and  for fiscal  and respectively 
accounts receivable during industry downturns  certain of our customers have difficulty with their cash flows 
certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  may delay their payments by days beyond the original terms 
we review the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness they incur with us 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot reasonably estimate whether collectibility is assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding credit worthiness 
in establishing our sales return allowance  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
in fiscal  and  we recorded a provision reversal for bad debt allowance and sales return in the total amount of   and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories if the current industry recovery falls below our expectation or we make changes in our current product development plans 
we estimate inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessments of future product sales giving consideration for factors such as the cyclical nature of our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to see demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change adversely  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to further write down inventory 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends fasb statements no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in sfas no 
r  share based payment  or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp 
an entity that adopts sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application may make a one time election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp 
an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no 
r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election 
this fsp became effective in november we account for stock based compensation awards issued to employees using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recorded for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab to provide implementation guidance on sfas r 
sab was issued to assist registrants in implementing sfas r while enhancing the information that investors receive 
we expect that the implementation of sfas r will result in a non cash charge of approximately million in fiscal the actual effects of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model we choose to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies we adopt concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method as described below we choose for adopting sfas r 
we adopted sfas r at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that is outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter statement 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any immediate material impact on us 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets sfas  which amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas requires prospective application for eliminating the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for exchanges of nonmonetary assets occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any immediate material impact on us 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas requires retroactive application of a change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable 
sfas also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate resulting from a change in accounting principle 
it is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  depending on the type of accounting change  the adoption of sfas may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf released issue  meaning of other than temporary impairment  which addressed other than temporary impairment for certain debt and equity investments 
the recognition and measurement requirements of issue  and other disclosure requirements not already implemented  were effective for periods after june  in september  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  which delayed the effective date for certain measurement and recognition guidance during the period of delay until a final consensus is reached 
in june  the fasb staff issued an fsp that supersedes eitf and effectively reverts the guidance for other than temporary impairments to previously established literature 
we do not expect to have a material effect to our consolidated financial statements 
in december the fasb issued two staff positions fsp fsp fas  application of fasb statement accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction of qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  and fsp fas accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of we believe that neither of these have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on may   the fasb issued fsp eitf  application of eitf issue no 
to freestanding financial instruments originally issued as employee compensation 
fas r indicates that a freestanding financial instrument issued to an employee such as a stock option ceases being subject to fas r and becomes subject to other applicable accounting standards when the rights conveyed by the instrument are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee 
the fsp clarifies that freestanding financial instruments originally issued as employee compensation that can be settled only by delivering registered shares should not be assumed to require cash settlement which would require liability accounting when applying the provisions of issue we do not expect no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth our historical operating results for the periods indicated in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses income loss from operations gain on sales of long term investment interest income and other income  net provision for income taxes net income revenues our net revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the general increase in volume orders from large original equipment manufacturers partially offset by discounts given on these orders 
our net revenues increased  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this slight increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the increased non recurring engineering revenues and sales of our new em windows media media processors in the ip video technology and connected media player markets which was partially offset by the decreased sales of other mpeg chipset products in the same markets 
revenues from sales of our products in the ip video technology and connected media player market was of our total revenues in fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal  while revenues from sales of our products in the pc add in market was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and for fiscal revenues from our hdtv products was immaterial for fiscal and we expect the percentage of revenues in ip video technology and connected media player markets will continue to increase while revenues from the pc add in market declines 
net income 
net income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the slight increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to million of investment gain and an increase of  in interest and other incomes  which were partially offset by million of operating loss incurred in fiscal as a result of an increase of million in operating expenses and decrease in the gross margin due to lower average selling price given to volume orders 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to an increased gross margin of million and an incentive of  received from the french tax authorities offset by an increase of million of operating expenses 
the incentive recovered qualifying research and development expenditures incurred by our french subsidiary 
the following table shows certain items as a percentage of net revenues  which are included in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal fiscal fiscal net revenues cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative gain on sales of long term investment interest income expense and other income loss  net net income net revenues net revenues by product group we have three main product groups chipsets  board and other products 
the following table sets forth our net revenues in each of our major product group and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each product group  for the last three years in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal chipsets boards other total net revenues chipsets 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume oem customers building products for the digital media processor market 
the increase of million  or  in net revenues from chipsets in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased unit sales of our chipsets into the ip video technology market and connected media player market offset by the lower average selling price given to large original equipment manufacturers for volume orders 
the increase of  or  in net revenues from chipsets in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to the continuing growth of demand for our chipset products from the ip video technology and connected media player markets  leading to increased unit sales and higher introduction selling prices of our new advanced dvd player and ip video set top box chipsets 
we expect that net revenues from chipset products will continue to fluctuate  primarily due to changes in demand from our customers and volume discounts given to large original equipment manufacturers 
if demand of our chipset products does not continue  our revenues and profitability would decline 
boards 
our board level product lines target oem customers to address the dvd upgrade market  system integrators to address the computer based training  kiosks  and corporate video on demand markets and consumer markets for upgraded multimedia products 
the increase of  or  in net revenues from board products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to increased unit sales of development reference boards to the various markets partially offset by decreased unit sales of project based board products for ip video applications 
the net revenues from mpeg based board products for fiscal was relatively constant as compared to fiscal we anticipate our revenues from board products to be relatively flat or decrease in future periods due to decreasing demand in board products  in general and our decision to focus on our chipset products in the ip video technology market and connected media player market instead of board products in these markets 
other 
the other category primarily includes revenue from development kits  engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets  freight fees and other accessories 
the costs related to support service revenues and certain small development contracts were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses  respectively 
the decrease in net revenues from other products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the decreased revenues from engineering support services and other accessories 
we expect that net revenues from other products will continue to fluctuate due mainly to the timing and complexity of engineering development required by our customers 
net revenues by market segment we sell our products primarily into four market segments which consist of the ip video technology market  the connected media player market  the hdtv product market and the pc add in and other market 
the following table sets forth our net revenues by market and the percentage of total net revenues represented by our product sales to each market segment for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal ip video technology market connected media player market hdtv product market pc add in and other markets total net revenues ip video technology market 
for fiscal  revenues from sales of our chipset products to the ip video technology market increased million  or  from fiscal and increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues in the ip video technology market for fiscal as compared to fiscal and was mainly attributable to increased unit sales of our chipset products into iptv set top box and digital media adapter markets offset by lower average selling prices 
we expect our revenues from the ip video technology market to fluctuate in future periods due to the uneven pace of iptv service deployments  the market development of iptv  in general  and volume discounts given to large original equipment manufacturers to capture the market share 
connected media player market 
for fiscal  revenues from sales of our products to the connected media player market increased  or  from fiscal and decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues from sales of our products to the connected media player market in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to the increased unit sales of our chipset products into portable media players market offset by lower average selling prices 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to the connected media player market in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the lower average selling prices of our mpeg chipsets 
we expect that revenues from sales of our products to the connected media player market will continue to fluctuate  primarily due to changes in demand from our customers and decisions regarding pricing strategy on volume orders 
if  however  our pricing strategy failed and these declines in average selling prices for our products being sold into the ip video technology and connected media player markets were to continue  it could harm our revenues and profitability 
hdtv product market 
we began shipment of hdtv applications during the second quarter of fiscal and experienced an increase in demand through fiscal we expect revenues in the hdtv product market to increase slowly over the near term 
pc add in and other markets 
the pc add in and other markets consists of pc add in board and chipset products  engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets  freight fees and other accessories 
for fiscal  revenues from the pc add in and other markets decreased  or  as compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to the pc add in and other markets in fiscal was due to the decreased engineering development revenues  support services and other accessories as compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues for fiscal was due primarily to the decreased unit sales of our chipsets to the pc add in market  partially offset by increased revenues in engineering development projects as compared to fiscal we expect our revenues from sales to the pc add in and other markets to continue to decline due to declining demand in the general market and we expect our revenues from engineering development to fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and complexity of the projects required by our customers 
net revenues by geographic region the following table sets forth our net revenues by geographic region  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each geographic region  for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal asia north america europe other regions total net revenues asia 
the revenues from asia which consists primarily of korea  china and taiwan increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in revenues from asia region was due primarily to the increased unit sales of our chipset products to the connected media player market and ip video technology market because of the shift of orders from customers in north america and europe regions to asia region and volume orders received from local original equipment manufacturers which was partially offset by lower average selling prices given to these orders 
the revenues from asia region which consists primarily of korea  china and taiwan in fiscal remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal our customers for chipset products in the ip video technology market and the connected media player market are concentrated in asia 
we expect that our revenues from asia will continue to increase due to increasing orders previously placed by our customers in the north america and europe regions who now manufacture their products in asia 
in fiscal  revenues from asia region which were over of total net revenues are as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal korea china taiwan north america 
north american revenues decreased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely due to the decreased unit sales of our board products to the ip video technology market which was partially offset by the increased unit sales of our chipset products 
this was due primarily to customers increasingly incorporating our chipsets into their final products 
in addition  there was a shift of chipset orders from our customers in the north american region to our customers in the asia region 
north american revenues in fiscal remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal we expect that our revenues from north america will continue to decline due to our customers gradually switching their orders to us from the higher value board products to the lower value chipset products 
in addition  our customers may place orders with other overseas manufacturers who incorporate our products into their final products 
as a result  our sales are moved from our north american customers to our overseas oems 
europe 
revenues from europe for fiscal decreased million  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues from europe was primarily attributable to decreases in unit sales of our chipset products 
this was due primarily to customers increasingly incorporating our chipsets into their final products  which were manufactured in the asia countries 
as a result  there was a shift of chipset orders from our customers in the europe region to our customers in the asia region 
revenues from europe for fiscal remained flat as compared to fiscal we anticipate revenues in europe will fluctuate due to the fact that our customers may place orders with other manufacturers in other regions  who incorporate our products into their final products 
as a result  our sales will move from our european customers to our customers in other regions 
for fiscal  we did not have sales in excess of of net revenues from a single european country 
for fiscal and  sales in denmark were and of net revenues  respectively 
no other european country accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal or in fiscal  our international revenues were of our total net revenues as compared to approximately in both fiscal and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues  due in part to the significant overseas manufacturing of consumer appliances by our chipset customers 
major customers major customers that accounted for over of our total net revenues are as follows customers regions fiscal fiscal fiscal a asia b europe less than no single customer accounted more than of our total net revenues customer b was acquired by a us corporation and undergoing the acquisition process in fiscal we believe we will continue to receive orders from the us corporation after the acquisition completed 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease of our gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to lower average selling prices provided to original equipment manufacturers for volume orders 
the increase of our gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to our continuing efforts to reduce the cost of our original mpeg board and chipset products  and the introduction and sales of our new higher margin chipset and board products as well as increased service and development revenues which have lower associated costs 
in addition  the costs related to service revenues and certain small development contracts were included in sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses see reference to critical accounting policies revenue recognition  while our expense for inventory obsolescence included in cost of revenues increased   and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  cost of revenues included  of accelerated depreciation expense due to reduction of estimated useful live for certain testing equipment 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of product sales  average selling prices  volume order discounts  our costs  the extent of development fees  changes in estimated useful lives of production testing equipment and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
because average selling prices of our products typically decline over the life of a product  if we are unable to reduce costs faster than the rate of such decline or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our gross margins will decline 
operating expenses fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands research development expense sales and marketing expenses general administrative expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year increases were primarily attributable to the additions of engineering staff at our headquarters  hong kong office and development center in france  independent contractors and consultants  prototype costs of new products  and various licensing fees 
as a result of our continuing efforts in the development of our proprietary mpeg and wmv based products and the addition of research and development personnel as a result of our acquisition of blue on february   research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased staff for engineering support and an increase in tradeshow related expenditures 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were comparable to fiscal as a result of increased headcount in our product marketing and sales development areas from our acquisition of blue on february   we expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars over next fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal year the increase was due primarily to an increase of  in legal   in professional services primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance and  of bad debt expense compared to a  recovery in we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods due to the increasing cost of insurance and professional services related to remediation efforts with sarbanes oxley compliance 
gain on sale of long term investment we recognized a total gain of approximately million on sales of long term investments in fiscal and recorded no investment gain in fiscal during fiscal  we sold our investment in series b preferred stock of a local mpeg system provider for approximately million 
we had no carrying amount in this investment at the date of sale  as it had been fully written off in fiscal the entire sales proceeds of approximately million was recognized as a gain on sales of investment during the year 
in addition  we sold another investment in an original equipment manufacturer with a carrying cost of approximately million for million and recognized a gain of million 
we do not expect that we will sell any of our remaining investments in the near future 
other income and expense other income and expenses mainly consisted of interest income from short term investment  interest expenses from our lines of credit and term loan  loss on disposal of fixed assets and gain or loss on sales of short term investments 
the increase of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase of  in interest income from cash and short term investments  offset by a decrease of  in the incentive received from the french tax authorities 
the increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase of  in interest income from short term investments and the receipt of an incentive of  received from the french tax authorities 
during fiscal  we received a second incentive payment of  as compared to  received in from the french tax authorities for the recovery of qualifying research and development expenditures incurred by our french subsidiary 
we will continue to apply for similar incentives each year 
however  there is no assurance that we will receive such incentives in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  an increase of approximately million compared with approximately million at january  this increase resulted from the sale of long term investments for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net borrowings of  from a loan agreement with a bank for financing research and development equipment  net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million and the exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock by employees resulting in cash proceeds of approximately million  which was partially offset by capital equipment expenditures of  and short term loans of  to blue communications in which we had an investment of million 
we subsequently acquired blue on february  blue is currently one of our subsidiaries 
the total  of short term loans to blue with accrued interest would be deducted from the total purchase price 
the remaining loan balance of  was pending for approval from the board of directors to be included as part of the acquisition cost for the blue merger 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for fiscal compared with million in fiscal and  in fiscal cash will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow revenue while limiting the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us  the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
our primary sources of funds to date have been proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  and borrowings under bank lines of credit 
in certain periods  cash generated from operations has also been a source of funds 
while we generated cash from operations for the year ended january  and  it is possible that our operations will consume cash in future periods 
based on our currently anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our primary uses of cash  which include our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments  and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will be able to comply with or make modifications to the current covenants under our existing asset based banking agreements  and to renew those lines of credit upon their expiration  in order to maintain the availability of funds under these agreements 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for fiscal compared with cash used in investing activities of million for and cash used in investing activities of million for the million of cash provided in fiscal was generated from approximately million of proceeds from sales of long term investments offset by  of capital expenditures  a  promissory note and  of short term investments 
the million of cash used in fiscal was primarily million for capital expenditures  million for short term investments and million for long term investments 
the million of cash used in fiscal was mainly  for capital expenditures and million for long term investments offset by a refund of  of rental deposit 
on february   sigma successfully acquired blue communications which was a privately held california corporation
