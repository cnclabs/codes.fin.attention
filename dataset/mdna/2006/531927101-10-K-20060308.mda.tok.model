item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of operations and financial condition of lifecell should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of see risk factors and risk factors special note regarding forward looking statements 
in the following discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid the presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
general and background we develop and market human derived tissue based products for use in reconstructive  orthopedic and urogynecologic surgical procedures to repair soft tissue defects 
our patented technology produces a unique regenerative human tissue matrix a complex three dimensional structure that contains vascular channels  proteins and growth factor binding sites that provides a template for the regeneration of normal human tissue 
our current products include alloderm  for plastic reconstructive  general surgical  burn and periodontal procedures  cymetra  a particulate form of alloderm suitable for injection  graftjacket and graftjacket xpress  for orthopedic applications and lower extremity wounds  allocraft dbm  for bone grafting procedures  and repliform  for urogynecologic surgical procedures 
we market alloderm for plastic reconstructive  general surgical and burn applications through our direct sales organization 
our strategic sales and marketing partners include boston scientific for repliform  wright medical group  inc for graftjacket and graftjacket xpress  stryker corporation for allocraftdbm  and biohorizons for periodontal applications of alloderm 
our research and development initiatives include programs designed to extend the use of our current regenerative tissue matrix products into new surgical applications  as well as leveraging our core technology to other tissues  including tissues recovered from non human sources 
we have a variety of research and development programs designed to expand our product line in the rapidly growing biologic market 
such programs include the investigation of novel biologics  alone or in combination with our regenerative tissue matrix 
critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these polices requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of assets and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers  which is generally when product is shipped to the customer 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
we utilize independent sales and marketing agents to supplement our direct sales organization 
for products marketed through our independent sales and marketing agents  we recognize revenue when the products are delivered to the third party customer  as this is when title and risk of loss to the product transfers 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue at the time the related product revenue is recognized 
research grant revenues are recognized at the time qualified expenses are incurred  unless we have continuing performance obligations  in which case revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such obligations 

table of contents accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debt losses on our accounts receivable based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
since our accounts receivable are not concentrated within a relatively few number of customers  we believe that a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and therefore our future operating results 
while bad debt losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions affecting our customers  we do not anticipate significant bad debt losses in inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on inventory quantities on hand  our historical product sales  and estimated forecast of future product demand and production requirements 
although we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate  any significant change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and therefore our future operating results 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we apply an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
stock based compensation 
we follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for equity based awards issued to employees and directors 
no stock based compensation cost for options is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current period as compared to million in the prior year 
revenues generated from the use of our products in reconstructive surgical procedures increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the growth was primarily driven by increased surgeon demand for alloderm in complex hernia repair procedures and breast reconstruction procedures 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in orthopedic product revenue grew to million in from million in this revenue growth resulted from increased demand for our graftjacket products 
graftjacket revenues were million in compared to million in revenues generated from the use of our repliform product in urogynecologic surgical procedures increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in demand for repliform in pelvic floor repairs increased  but the growth was partially offset by decreased use of repliform for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence  which has been negatively affected by competition from synthetic alternatives 

table of contents we utilize independent sales and marketing agents and distributors to suplement our direct sales organization in certain markets 
our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenue in the year ended december  and in boston scientific and wright medical represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues in compared to and  respectively  for the same period in no other individual independent sales agent or distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in the year ended december  research grant revenues decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research spending on projects funded by approved research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized when qualified expenses are incurred 
as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through the end of costs and expenses costs and expenses as a percentage of product revenue were the following at december  dollars in thousands dollars dollars cost of procucts sold research and development general and administrative selling and marketing total costs and expenses cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or of product revenue  for the same period in cost of products sold includes the impact of a million inventory write off related to a voluntary product recall in the third quarter of the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the inventory write off and increased tissue recovery costs  partially offset by efficiencies gained through increased processing volume 
total research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i increased payroll and related expenses resulting from increases in the scientific and technical staff  ii increased outside testing and services  iii increased operating supplies and iv increased pre clinical testing 
our research and development initiatives include programs designed to extend the use of our current regenerative tissue matrix products into new surgical applications  as well as leverage our core technology to other tissues  including tissues recovered from non human sources 
we have a variety of research and development programs designed to expand our product line in the rapidly growing biosurgery market 
such programs include the investigation of novel biomaterials  alone or in combination with our regenerative tissue matrix 
we plan to increase our research and development expenditures in and expect research and development spending for the full year to represent approximately of product revenue 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i increases in payroll and related expenses associated with increased headcount  annual merit increases and expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock  ii professional fees  iii depreciation expense associated with a new fully integrated computer software system and iv an increase in insurance expense 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i selling expenses  principally payroll  commissions and travel and entertainment resulting from the expansion of our direct sales force and increased revenues  ii payroll and related expenses associated with increased marketing headcount  annual merit increases and expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock  iii an increase in professional fees for market research  and iv an increase in expenses for medical education programs 
our independent sales and marketing agents are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
selling and marketing expenses included agent fees of million and million  respectively  in and agency fees decreased because one of our independent sales and marketing agents changed from an agency relationship to a distributor relationship and no longer was paid agency fees 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased  in compared to the net increase was due to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher level of average investments and higher rate of return 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million in compared to  in during  we recognized a non cash income tax benefit resulting from a change in the projected tax rate that future year tax benefits are expected to be recovered or settled 
the favorable impact of the tax benefit on net income in was  during  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to reflect net deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not of being realized 
the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million in although we recorded a tax provision in and  we are not required to pay regular federal income taxes until such time as our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are exhausted or expire 
we paid estimated federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes of  in and  in years ended december  and revenunes total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current period as compared to million in the prior year 
revenues generated from the use of our products in reconstructive surgical procedures increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the growth was primarily driven by increased demand for alloderm in complex hernia repair procedures  partially offset by a decrease in cymetra revenues 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in cymetra revenues were negatively impacted by competitive products in and we expect this trend to continue in revenues generated from the use of our repliform product in urogynecologic surgical procedures decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in demand for repliform in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence has been negatively affected by competition from synthetic alternatives  and we anticipate this trend to continue in orthopedic product revenue grew to million in from million in this revenue growth resulted from increased demand for our graftjacket product  which was launched in the first quarter of  and allocraft dbm  which was introduced on a limited basis in the fourth quarter of graftjacket and allocraft dbm revenues were million and million  respectively  in compared to million and  in our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenue in the year ended december  and in boston scientific and wright medical represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues in compared to and  respectively  for the same period in no other individual independent sales agent or distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in the year ended december  
table of contents total revenues were also favorably impacted by a increase in research grant revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research spending on projects funded by approved research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized when qualified expenses are incurred 
as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through costs and expenses costs and expenses as a percentage of product revenue were the following at december  dollars in thousands dollars dollars cost of procucts sold research and development general and administrative selling and marketing total costs and expenses cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or of product revenue for the same period in in  the cost of products sold included costs related to the launch of allocraft dbm  which increased the cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenues 
total research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to increased research and development headcount  professional fees and expenses related to animal studies 
our research and development initiatives include programs designed to extend the use of our current regenerative tissue matrix products into new surgical applications as well as leveraging our core technology to other tissues 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in regulatory and accounting professional fees  payroll and related expenses associated with increased headcount and annual merit increases and depreciation expense associated with a new fully integrated computer software system 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i higher selling expenses  principally payroll  commissions and travel and entertainment resulting from increased revenues and the expansion of our direct sales force and ii an increase in marketing and medical education expenses for alloderm 
our independent sales and marketing agents are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
selling and marketing expenses included agent fees of million and million  respectively  in and the decrease in agent fees resulted from a decline in revenue generated through our independent sales and marketing agents 
interest and other income  net interest and other income expense  net increased  in compared to the net increase was primarily due to a  increase in interest income primarily resulting from a higher level of investments and a  decrease in interest expense resulting from the pay off of outstanding debt in the third quarter of 
table of contents income tax provision the provision for income taxes was  in compared to a benefit of million in prior to the fourth quarter of  no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded because we were in a net deferred tax asset position and a full valuation allowance had been recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated the amount of valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and reduced the valuation allowance to reflect net deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not of being realized 
the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we further reduced the amount of the valuation allowance  which resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  is net of the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter 
the valuation allowance of  at december  applies to certain tax credits that  in the opinion of management  are more likely than not to expire before we can use them 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term marketable securities 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from increases in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  inventories and current deferred taxes  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we generated million of cash from operating activities for year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash from operating activities in  as compared to  was principally due to increases in net income after adjustments for non cash items 
such increases were partially offset by a planned increase in inventories to support anticipated growth and a normal increase in receivables associated with higher revenue 
although we recorded a tax provision in and  we are not required to pay regular federal income taxes until such time as our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are exhausted or expire 
capital expenditures were million in and consisted primarily of the purchase of manufacturing and computer equipment 
in addition  we acquired certain technology licensing rights for million in our financing activities generated million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in in both years  the cash generated from financing activities resulted from the exercise of common stock options and warrants 
we had a million revolving line of credit with a financial institution that expired in march after considering our anticipated near term cash requirements  we elected not to renew the credit facility 
the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total after operating leases licensing agreement total contractual cash obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
although we have entered into contracts for services  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
at the end of  we commenced a facility expansion at our branchburg  new jersey facility 
estimated expenditures for the facility expansion are approximately million in and million in 
table of contents we believe that our current cash resources together with anticipated product revenues and committed research and development grant funding will be sufficient to finance our planned operations  research and development programs and fixed asset requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  we may need additional funds to meet our long term strategic objectives  including to complete potential acquisitions 
we have no commitments for any future funding and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding in the future through debt or equity financings  collaborative arrangements or other sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freights  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the nomal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operrations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of the following methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method effective january  through december   as permitted by sfas  we accounted for stock options awarded to employees and directors using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adopting sfas r in will be the recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense associated with outstanding stock options that vest during the year 
however  the adoption of sfas r will have no impact on our overall cash flows and financial position 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be recorded when realized as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature
