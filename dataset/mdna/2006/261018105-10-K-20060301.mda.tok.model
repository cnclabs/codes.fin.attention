for further information  see insurance of deposit accounts on page  investments in real estate and joint ventures on page and regulatory capital compliance on page critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions  which are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of our financial statements the valuation of interest rate lock commitments 
we enter into commitments to make loans that we intend to sell to investors whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding 
these interest rate lock commitments are considered to be derivatives and are recorded at fair value 
this value is calculated using market sources  adjusted by an anticipated fallout factor for interest rate lock commitments that are not expected to fund 
at december   downey had a notional amount of interest rate lock commitments identified to sell as part of its secondary marketing activities of million  with a change in fair value resulting in a loss of million  compared to a notional amount of interest rate lock commitments of million with a change in fair value resulting in a gain of million at december  for further information  see note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements

navigation links the allowance for losses on loans and real estate 
the allowance for losses on loans and real estate are maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolios 
we use an internal asset review system and loan loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
in determining the allowance for loan losses related to loan relationships of million or more  we evaluate the loans on an individual basis  including an analysis of the borrower s creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status  and the condition and the estimated value of the collateral 
unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis  we generally review all loans under million by analyzing their performance and the composition of their collateral as a whole because of the relatively homogeneous nature of the loans 
this allowance is determined by applying against asset balances the associated loss factors for each major asset type that consider past loss experience and asset duration or loss statistics against current classified asset balances 
at december  and  the allowance totaled million 
for further information  see allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page the valuation of msrs 
the fair value of msrs is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on available market quotes  market adjusted discount rates and anticipated prepayment speeds 
market sources are used to determine prepayment speeds  the net cost of servicing per loan  inflation rate  and default and interest rates for mortgages 
msrs are reviewed for impairment based on their fair value 
we capitalize and measure msr impairment on a disaggregated basis based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans  which include fixed rate mortgage loans by loan term and coupon rate less than  basis point increments between and  and greater than and adjustable rate mortgages by loan term 
impairment losses are recognized through a valuation allowance for each impaired stratum  with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing income loss 
at december   the msr valuation allowance totaled million  compared to the prior year end allowance of million 
for further information  see note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the prepayment reserves related to sales of loans and of msrs 
the gains on sales of loans and of msrs are recorded net of reserves for anticipated prepayments 
these sales contracts typically contain provisions to refund sale price premiums to the purchaser if the related loans prepay during a period not to exceed days from the sale s date 
loan and msr sales reserves are estimated using the prepayment experience of similar products 
the estimates are updated during the day period for actual payoffs 
at december   the reserves were less than a million  compared to reserves of million at december  for further information  see secondary marketing activities on page  note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements

navigation links results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities principally affects net interest income 
our net interest income totaled million in  up million or from and up million or from the improvement during reflected higher average interest earning assets which increased by billion or to billion 
our effective interest rate spread averaged in  down from in and in the decline in was due to our cost on deposits and borrowings rising more rapidly than our yield on interest earning assets 
the primary reason for the slower rise in our yield on interest earning assets was a higher level of deferred loan origination costs being written off and netted against interest income in the current year than the prior year related to loan repayments 
however  those write offs were  in part  offset by higher loan prepayment fees recognized in other income 
the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  interest rate spread and effective interest rate spread 
the effective interest rate spread reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  divided by average interest earning assets for the year 
the table also sets forth our net interest earning balance the difference between the average balance of interest earning assets and the average balance of total deposits and borrowings for the years indicated 
we included non accrual loans in the average interest earning assets balance 
we included interest from non accrual loans in interest income only to the extent we received payments and believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loans

page 
navigation links asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending and deposit taking activities 
interest rate risk primarily occurs to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
since our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  our principal objectives are to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income 
our primary strategy to manage interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination for investment of adjustable rate mortgages or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages are primarily tied to cofi  mta  libor and cmt 
we also may execute swap contracts to change interest rate characteristics of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities to better manage interest rate risk 
in addition to the interest rate risk associated with our lending for investment and deposit taking activities  we also have market risk associated with our secondary marketing activities 
changes in mortgage interest rates  primarily fixed rate mortgages  impact the fair value of loans held for sale as well as our interest rate lock commitment derivatives  where we have committed to an interest rate with a potential borrower for a loan we intend to sell 
our objective is to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates through use of loan forward sale and purchase contracts with government sponsored enterprises and whole loan sale contracts with various parties 
these contracts are typically obtained at the time the interest rate lock commitments are made 
therefore  as interest rates fluctuate  the changes in the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments and loans held for sale tend to be offset by changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts 
we continue to hedge as previously done before the issuance of sfas as applied to our risk management strategies  sfas may increase or decrease reported net income and stockholders equity  depending on interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items  but will have no effect on the overall economics of the transactions 
the method used for assessing the effectiveness of a hedging derivative  as well as the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspects of the hedge  is established at the inception of the hedge 
we generally do not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 
changes in mortgage interest rates also impact the value of our msrs 
rising interest rates typically result in slower prepayment speeds on the loans being serviced for others which increase the value of msrs 
declining interest rates typically result in faster prepayment speeds which decrease the value of msrs 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a fairly simple hedging strategy by purchasing securities classified as available for sale as a partial economic hedge against future value changes in our msrs 
during periods when long term interest rates decline  the value of our msrs will fall and the resultant msr valuation addition will  in general  be partially offset by securities gains 
however  if long term interest rates rise causing msr values to improve  the securities will be in a loss position and may be sold with the intention to reset the hedge at a higher market interest rate 
any realized loss from the securities sales will be mitigated by the favorable earnings impact associated with the recapture of any existing msr valuation allowance 
while this strategy is not constructed to be a perfect hedge  it is expected to reduce earnings volatility from changing msr values 
over time  we may use derivatives in lieu of securities  or a combination of both  to provide an economic hedge against value changes in our msrs 
in addition  the dollar amount used as an economic hedge may vary as we reset the hedge due to changes in the volume of msrs or their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
in connection with the sale of approximately of our msrs during the fourth quarter of  which reduced the risk exposure to changing msr values  the partial economic hedge established in the first quarter of was closed in october our asset liability management committee is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors of acceptable changes in net interest income and net portfolio value from specified changes in interest rates 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
our asset liability management committee reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and our current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
in addition  our asset liability management committee monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and performs various simulations and other analyses to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
based on these reviews  our asset liability management committee formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in our business plan without exceeding the net interest income and net portfolio value limits set forth in our interest rate risk policy

navigation links one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major asset and liability categories as of december   as well as other information regarding the repricing and maturity differences between our interest earning assets and the total of deposits and borrowings in future periods 
we refer to these differences as gap 
we have determined the repricing frequencies by reference to projected maturities  based upon contractual maturities as adjusted for scheduled repayments and repricing mechanisms provisions for changes in the interest and dividend rates of assets and liabilities 
we assume prepayment rates on substantially all of our loan portfolio based upon our historical loan prepayment experience and anticipated future prepayments 
repricing mechanisms on a number of our assets are subject to limitations  such as caps on the amount that interest rates and payments on our loans may adjust  and accordingly  these assets do not normally respond to changes in market interest rates as completely or rapidly as our liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if we used different assumptions or if actual experience differed from the assumptions set forth

navigation links our six month gap at december  was a positive 
this means that more interest earning assets mature or reprice within six months than the total of deposits and borrowings 
this is up from a positive six month gap of at december  and at december  we originated and purchased for investment loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or maturities of five years or less of approximately billion during  billion during and billion during these loans represented essentially all loans and mortgage backed securities originated and purchased for investment during  and at december   and  essentially all of our interest earning assets mature  reprice or are estimated to prepay within five years 
at december   billion or essentially all of our loans held for investment and mortgage backed securities portfolios consisted of adjustable rate loans and loans with a due date of five years or less  compared to billion or at december  and billion or at december  during  we will continue to offer residential fixed rate loan products to our customers to meet customer demand 
we primarily originate fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and price them accordingly to create loan servicing income and to increase opportunities for originating adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we may originate fixed rate loans for investment when funded with long term funds to mitigate interest rate risk and small volumes to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure or that meet required yield and other approved guidelines 
for further information  see secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page we are better protected against rising interest rates with a positive six month gap 
however  we remain subject to possible interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact our net interest income if interest rates rise 
this is primarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices  to which our adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and periodic interest rate caps on these adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the amount of such interest rate spread compression would depend upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  we establish limits on  and measure the sensitivity of  our net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
we utilize an internally maintained asset liability management simulation model to make the calculations which  for net portfolio value  are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
first  we estimate our net interest income for the next twelve months and the current net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  we make calculations for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any associated differences in the anticipated prepayment speed of loans 
we then compare those results against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and net portfolio value due to the changes in interest rates 
the following are the estimated impacts to net interest income and net portfolio value from various instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates based upon our asset and liability structure as of year ends and since we base these estimates upon numerous assumptions  like the expected maturities of our interest bearing assets and liabilities and the shape of the period end interest rate yield curve  our actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary significantly if actual experience differs from those assumptions used in making the calculations 
percentage change in percentage change in change in interest rates net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio in basis points income a value b income a value b c n a n a a the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios

navigation links the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments and call provisions for investment securities 
market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
our assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as certain deposits  are considered to be long term in nature and are reported in the thereafter column 
we do not consider these financial instruments to be materially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  and historically  the balances have remained fairly constant over various economic conditions 
the weighted average interest rates for the various fixed rate and variable rate assets and liabilities presented are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the fair value of our financial instruments is determined as follows fed funds and fhlb stock equal their book values due to their short term repricing characteristics 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities are based on the closing market price quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
loans held for sale are based on bid quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
loans held for investment takes into consideration discounted cash flows through the estimated maturity or repricing dates using estimated market discount rates 
demand deposits  money market and savings accounts are equal to their book values 
time deposits and borrowings are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using wholesale borrowing rates offered for similar terms 
senior notes are based on bid prices published in financial newspapers  or bid quotations received from securities dealers or readily available market quote systems 
the degree of market risk inherent in loans with prepayment features may not be completely reflected in the disclosures 
although we have taken into consideration our historical prepayment trends adjusted for current market conditions to determine expected maturity categories  prepayment features are triggered by changes in the market rates of interest 
unexpected changes may increase the rate of prepayments above those anticipated 
as such  the potential loss from such market rate changes may be significantly larger

it is our policy to take appropriate  timely and aggressive action when necessary to resolve non performing assets 
when resolving problem loans  it is our policy to determine collectibility under various circumstances which are intended to result in our maximum financial benefit 
we accomplish this by either working with the borrower to bring the loan current or by foreclosing and selling the asset 
we perform ongoing reviews of loans that display weaknesses and maintain adequate loss allowances for them 
for a discussion on our internal asset review policy  refer to allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page at december   million of our non performing assets were located outside of california  compared to million outside of california a year ago 
we evaluate the need for appraisals of non performing assets on a periodic basis 
we will generally obtain a new appraisal when we believe that there may have been an adverse change in the property operations or in the economic conditions of the geographic market of the property securing our loans 
our policy is to obtain new appraisals at least annually for all real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non accrual loans it is our general policy to account for a loan as non accrual when the loan becomes days delinquent or when collection of interest appears doubtful 
in a number of cases  loans may remain on accrual status past days when we determine that continued accrual is warranted because the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
as of december   we had no loans days or more delinquent which remained on accrual status 
we reverse and charge against interest income any interest previously accrued with respect to non accrual loans 
we recognize interest income on non accrual loans to the extent that we receive payments and to the extent that we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we restore these loans to an accrual status only if all past due payments are made by the borrower and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest

troubled debt restructurings we consider a restructuring of a debt a troubled debt restructuring when we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise grant 
troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms  reducing the stated interest rate or reducing the amounts of principal and or interest due or extending the maturity date 
the restructuring of a loan is intended to recover as much of our investment as possible and to achieve the highest yield possible

if the loan is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  which is normally five business days prior to the date set for the non judicial trustee s sale  we may then sell the property at a foreclosure sale 
in general  if we have elected to pursue a non judicial foreclosure  we are not permitted under applicable law to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower  even if the security property is insufficient to cover the balance owed

navigation links allowance for losses on loans and real estate we maintain a valuation allowance for losses on loans and real estate to provide for losses inherent in those portfolios 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance quarterly to maintain the allowance at levels sufficient to provide for inherent losses 
a key component to our evaluation is our internal asset review process 
our internal asset review department conducts independent reviews to evaluate the risk and quality of all our assets 
our internal asset review committee is responsible for the review and classification of assets 
the internal asset review committee members include the director of internal asset review  president and chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chief financial officer  chief lending officer  general counsel and chief credit officer 
the internal asset review committee meets quarterly to review and determine asset classifications and recommend any changes to asset valuation allowances 
with the exception of payoffs or asset sales  the classification of an asset  once established  can be removed or upgraded only upon approval of the internal asset review committee or the director of internal asset review as delegated by the committee 
the audit committee of the board of directors quarterly reviews the overall asset quality  the adequacy of valuation allowances on classified and non classified assets  and our adherence to policies and procedures regarding asset classification and valuation through reports from the director of internal asset review and others 
we use an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate general valuation allowances to cover asset losses 
our current asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
we use the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk for determining the valuation allowance at a point in time 
we currently use a six grade system to classify our assets 
the current grades are pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
we consider substandard  doubtful and loss assets classified assets for regulatory purposes 
a brief description of these classifications follows the pass classification represents a level of credit quality which contains no well defined deficiency or weakness 
the watch classification identifies an asset that currently contains no well defined deficiency or weakness  but warrants close monitoring eg  loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this category may also be used for assets upgraded from lower classifications where continuing monitoring is deemed appropriate 
a special mention asset does not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification  but does possess a correctable deficiency or potential weakness deserving management s close attention 
substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
an asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values 
we consider doubtful to be a temporary classification until resolution of pending weakness issues enables us to more clearly define the potential for loss 
page 
navigation links that portion of an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of so little value that its continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather it is not reasonable to defer writing off or providing for all or a portion of the asset even though partial recovery may occur 
we will generally classify as loss the balance of the asset that is greater than the net fair value of the asset unless we can expect payment from another source 
therefore  the amount of an asset classified as loss reflects the specific valuation allowance established for the particular asset 
specific valuation allowances are not includable in determining the bank s total regulatory capital 
the ots has the authority to require us to change our asset classifications 
if the change results in an asset being classified in whole or in part as loss  a specific allowance must be established against the amount so classified or that amount must be charged off 
ots guidelines set forth quantitative benchmarks as a starting point for the determination of appropriate levels of general valuation allowances 
the ots generally directs its examiners to rely on management s estimates of adequate general valuation allowances if the bank s process for determining adequate allowances is deemed to be sound 
the allowance for losses on loans and real estate are maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover inherent losses 
we have implemented and use an internal asset review system and loan loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
in determining the allowance for loan losses related to loan relationships of million or more  we evaluate the loans on an individual basis  including an analysis of the borrower s creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status  and the condition and the estimated value of the collateral 
unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis  we generally review all loans under million by analyzing their performance and composition of collateral as a whole because of their relatively homogeneous nature 
given the above evaluations  the amount of the allowance is based upon the total of general valuation allowances  allocated allowances and an unallocated allowance 
we utilize the asset classifications from our internal asset review process in the following manner to determine the amount of our allowances general valuation allowances this element relates to assets with no well defined deficiency or weakness ie  assets classified pass or watch and takes into consideration loss that is imbedded within the portfolio but has not yet been realized 
generally  we believe that borrowers are impacted by events well in advance of a lender s knowledge that may ultimately result in loan default and eventual loss 
examples of such loss causing events would be job loss  divorce or medical crisis in the case of single family residential and consumer loans  or loss of a major tenant in the case of commercial real estate loans 
we determine general valuation allowances by applying against asset balances the associated loss factors for each major asset type that consider past loss experience and asset duration 
allocated allowances this element relates to assets with well defined deficiencies or weaknesses ie  assets classified special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
we calculate losses on an ongoing basis by credit classification for each major asset type 
loss factors based upon those loss statistics are applied against current classified asset balances to determine the amount of allocated allowances 
included in these allowances are those amounts associated with assets where it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine our carrying value of the asset exceeds the net fair value and no alternative payment source exists  then we record a specific allowance for the amount of that difference 
unallocated allowance this element is more subjective and is reviewed quarterly to take into consideration estimation errors and economic trends that are not necessarily captured in determining the general valuation and allocated allowances

navigation links we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we carry impaired loans at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the net fair value of the collateral securing the loan 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment 
generally  loans we collectively review for impairment include all single family loans and performing multi family and non residential loans having principal balances of less than million  unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis 
in determining impairment  we consider large non homogeneous loans that are on non accrual  have been restructured or are performing but exhibit  among other characteristics  high loan to value ratios or delinquent taxes 
we base the measurement of collateral dependent impaired loans on the net fair value of the loan s collateral 
we value non collateral dependent loans based on a present value calculation of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective rate or the loan s observable market price 
we generally use cash receipts on impaired loans not performing according to contractual terms to reduce the carrying value of the loan  unless we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we include impairment losses in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to provision for loan losses 
we include adjustments to impairment losses due to changes in the fair value of the collateral of impaired loans in provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  we record loss of principal through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   we had no recorded investment or allowance for losses in loans for which we have recognized impairment

the current year included a recapture of million of valuation allowances from the sale of a neighborhood shopping center 
the provision in is related to one property under construction 
the provision reductions in the two years prior to were  in general  due to a continuing improvement in the real estate market which favorably impacted the valuation of certain neighborhood shopping center investments and to a reduction in the investment in certain joint venture investments
