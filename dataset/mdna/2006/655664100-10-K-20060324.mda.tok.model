our suppliers include domestic and foreign businesses 
we expect our suppliers to meet our nordstrom partnership standards and business practice guidelines  which address our standards for matters such as law  labor  health and safety  and environment 
competitive conditions all segments of our business are highly competitive 
each of our stores competes with other national  regional and local retail establishments that may carry similar lines of merchandise  including department stores  specialty stores  boutiques  mail order and internet businesses

risk factors 
our business faces many risks 
we believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us 
however  these risks may not be the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents ability to respond to the business environment and fashion trends our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner 
any sustained failure to identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could have a material adverse affect on our business 
consumer spending at our stores may be affected by many factors outside of our control  including consumer confidence  weather and other hazards of nature that affects consumer traffic  and general economic conditions 
inventory management we strive to ensure the merchandise we offer remains fresh and compelling to our customers 
if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases  we may have excess inventory  which would result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance 
impact of competitive market forces the recent retail industry consolidation changes the environment for many of our vendors and customers 
in the future  our competition may partner more effectively with vendors to serve the market s needs 
if we do not effectively respond to changes in our environment  we may see a loss of market share to competitors  declining same store sales  and declining profitability due to higher markdowns 
store growth strategy as of march  our plans for the next three years include opening new stores and relocating or remodeling existing stores 
in the past  our expected opening dates have sometimes been delayed because of development plan delays 
our future growth could be negatively impacted by delays to our store opening  relocating or remodeling plans 
in addition  our future net sales at new  relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections  which could reduce our operating performance 
performance in our new stores could also be impacted based on our ability to hire employees who are able to deliver the level of service customers have come to expect when shopping at our stores 
information security and privacy the protection of our customer  employee  and company data is critical to us 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business units 
in addition  our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
a significant breach of customer  employee  or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales  fines  or lawsuits 
leadership development and succession planning the training and development of our future leaders is critical to our long term growth 
if we do not effectively implement our strategic and business planning processes to train and develop future leaders  our long term growth may suffer 
in addition  if unexpected leadership turnover occurs without established succession plans  our business may suffer 
board succession a number of our long standing directors who were instrumental in leading our company have retired or will soon retire from our board 
these board members with extensive experience will no longer be actively involved in our business and development of our long term strategy 
we are welcoming a number of new members to our board  and we expect to benefit from their vast business experience 
multi channel strategy execution in  we started to make changes in our direct business that better align our online shopping environment and catalog with the customer experience in our full line stores 
these changes include aligning our direct merchandise offering with our full line stores to create a seamless experience for our customers between our stores  catalogs and web site  integrating our full line stores and direct merchandise organization  recommending that our full line store salespeople utilize our direct inventory to fulfill customer requests when merchandise is not available at the store  reducing the number and frequency of our direct catalog mailings  and transitioning our direct inventory system onto our full line store platform  all while dealing with changes in the internet market in general 
if we made decisions that prove to not be embraced by our customers  our sales could decline 
in addition  the cost of integrating these businesses may be greater than expected  which would impact our future operating performance 
brand and reputation we have a well recognized brand that is synonymous with the highest level of customer service 
any significant damage to our brand or reputation may negatively impact same store sales  lower employee morale and productivity  and diminish customer trust  resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 
capital efficiency and proper allocation our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall returns 
this includes spending on inventory  capital projects and expenses  managing debt levels  managing accounts receivable through our credit business  and using our assets efficiently to return value to our shareholders 
to a large degree  capital efficiency reflects how well we manage the other key risks to our company 
the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency 
our recent operating results have raised expectations about our performance 
if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  we may fail to continue to produce similar financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value 

table of contents human resource regulations our policies and procedures are designed to comply with human resource laws such as wage and hour  meal and rest period  and commissions 
federal and state wage and hour laws are complex  and the related enforcement is increasingly aggressive  particularly in the state of california 
failure to comply with these laws could result in damage to our reputation  class action lawsuits  and dissatisfied employees 
employment and discrimination laws state and federal employment and discrimination laws and the related case law continue to evolve  making ongoing compliance in this area a challenge 
failure to comply with these laws may result in damage to our reputation  legal and settlement costs  disruption of our business  and loss of customers and employees  which would result in a loss of net sales and increased employment costs  low employee morale and attendant harm to our business and results of operations 
technology strategy we make investments in information technology to sustain our competitive position 
we spend on average approximately million each year on information technology operations and system development  and this spending is key to our growth strategy 
we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace 
targeting the wrong opportunities  failing to make the best investment  or making an investment commitment significantly above or below the requirements of the business opportunity may result in the loss of our competitive position 
in addition  an inadequate investment in maintaining our current systems may result in a loss of system functionality and increased future costs to bring our systems up to date 
we may implement too much technology  or change too fast  which could result in failure to adopt the new technology if the business is not ready or capable of accepting it 
excessive technological change affects the effectiveness of adoption  and could adversely affect the realization of benefits from the technology 
however  not implementing enough technology could compromise our competitive position 
regulatory compliance our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including those imposed by the sec  nyse  the banking industry  and foreign countries 
with recent high profile business failures on accounting related issues  additional legal and regulatory requirements such as the sarbanes oxley act have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment 
in addition  foreign laws may conflict with domestic laws 
failure to comply with the various regulations may result in damage to our reputation  civil and criminal liability  fines and penalties  increased cost of regulatory compliance  and restatements of financial statements 
anti takeover provisions we are incorporated in the state of washington and subject to washington state law 
some provisions of washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
for example  one statutory provision prohibits us  except under specified circumstances  from engaging in any significant business transaction with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock which shareholder  under the statute  would be considered an acquiring person for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an acquiring person

table of contents item legal proceedings 
cosmetics we were originally named as a defendant along with other department store and specialty retailers in nine separate but virtually identical class action lawsuits filed in various superior courts of the state of california in may  june and july that were consolidated in marin county superior court 
in may  plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming a number of manufacturers of cosmetics and fragrances and two other retailers as additional defendants 
plaintiffs amended complaint alleges that the retail price of the prestige or department store cosmetics and fragrances sold in department and specialty stores was collusively controlled by the retailer and manufacturer defendants in violation of the cartwright act and the california unfair competition act 
plaintiffs seek treble damages and restitution in an unspecified amount  attorneys fees and prejudgment interest  on behalf of a class of all california residents who purchased cosmetics and fragrances for personal use from any of the defendants during the four years prior to the filing of the original complaints 
we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs and the other defendants on july  in furtherance of the settlement agreement  the case was re filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california on behalf of a class of all persons who currently reside in the united states and who purchased department store cosmetics and fragrances from the defendants during the period may  through july  the court gave preliminary approval to the settlement  and a summary notice of class certification and the terms of the settlement were disseminated to class members 
on march   the court entered a final judgment approving the settlement and dismissing the plaintiffs claims and the claims of all class members with prejudice  in their entirety 
on april   two class members who had objected to the settlement filed notices of appeal from the court s final judgment to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
the objectors appellate brief is due on march   and plaintiffs and defendants briefs are due in late april or early may  it is uncertain when the appeals will be resolved  but the appeal process could take as much as another year or more 
if the court s final judgment approving the settlement is affirmed on appeal  or the appeals are dismissed  the defendants will provide class members with certain free products with an estimated retail value of million and pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees  awarded by the court  of million 
our share of the cost of the settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

this mindset has served us well over the last few years as we have generated same store sales growth and improved our gross profit and selling  general  and administrative rates 
our initiatives maintain the same focus but also recognize the developments in our business and the marketplace 
drive top line growth our top priority is to gain market share through existing stores and channels  as well as from new full line stores 
our success in accomplishing this goal starts and ends with the experience each customer has in our stores 
we believe the essence of this experience is desirable products coupled with personalized service 
our ongoing focus revolves around these two key elements of our business as we believe they are an integral part of long term success 
for  we have identified three specific areas of focus to drive top line growth re energizing women s apparel  multi channel integration and enhancing our designer business 
women s apparel women s apparel represents about one third of our total sales and serves a wide range of individual tastes and styles 
in  we started to develop more targeted merchandising strategies for our women s departments 
a thorough analysis of objective customer information combined with the feedback from our selling floor has helped us to better understand our customers needs and shopping priorities in terms of style  price  fit and occasion 
we have carefully reorganized our merchant teams and are in the process of fine tuning our offerings to better serve our customers 
multi channel integration our goal is to create a more integrated  consistent merchandise offering for our customers  whether they choose to shop in our full line stores  on the internet or through our catalogs 
as described in multi channel strategy execution on page  we initiated the integration in in we will begin migrating the direct inventory system onto our full line store platform  creating a one company view of inventory resulting in a more seamless merchandise offering and experience for our customer 
this process is expected to continue through designer our women s designer category has been a strong performer and contributes significantly to the aspirational nature of our brand 
our goal is to have a complete designer offering in at least one store for every major market we serve 
in addition  we are focused on enhancing and aligning our designer offering across all major merchandise categories 
in august  we purchased a majority interest in jeffrey  a luxury specialty store business with stores in new york city and atlanta  and named the founder  president and ceo of jeffrey  mr 
jeffrey kalinsky  director of designer merchandising at nordstrom

kalinsky s expertise and creativity in the designer business to further our current designer strategies

continue to gain operational efficiencies as we drive top line growth  we seek to expand our gross profit and reduce our selling  general and administrative rates by minimizing the increases to our buying  occupancy  general and administrative costs 
this approach has been successful over the past three years  as we have controlled these costs while we supported our same store sales growth 
we are committed to keeping our technology investments current and relevant to our business needs 
this includes investing in ongoing maintenance and system enhancements as well as replacing older applications as the opportunities present themselves 
this is an ongoing part of our overall technology investment strategy 
we anticipate additional rate improvement from our buying and corporate organization as we enhance our processes and expand the use of our systems to support our future sales growth 
leadership development and succession planning at nordstrom  we are committed to developing the best talent in retail 
the training and development of our future leaders is critical to our long term growth 
to that end  we have identified potential successors for all major leadership roles 
we have also piloted with executives a leadership development program designed to increase specifically identified leadership skills 
this program includes identifying each leader s development needs and includes personal coaching as well as interactive group learning 
this program will be rolled out to approximately leaders by the end of with plans to train more individuals over the next few years

under our co branded visa program  we earn interchange and finance charge income and we offer card holders merchandise certificates  which can be redeemed in our stores  similar to a gift certificate 
our operating cash flows have been sufficient over the past three years to support the annual growth of this program  and we expect additional growth in also will be funded from our operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies we feel are critical 
off balance sheet financing our co branded nordstrom visa credit card receivables are transferred to a third party trust on a daily basis 
the balance of the receivables transferred to the trust fluctuates as new receivables are generated and old receivables are retired through payments received  charge offs  or credits from merchandise returns 
the trust issues securities that are backed by the receivables 
certain of these securities or beneficial interests are sold to third party investors and those remaining securities are issued to us 
we recognize gains or losses on the sale of the co branded nordstrom visa receivables to the trust based on the difference between the face value of the receivables sold and the estimated fair value of the assets created in the securitization process 
the fair value of the assets is calculated as the present value of their expected cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate fair value represents the volatility and risk of the assets 
assumptions and judgments are made to estimate the fair value of our investment in asset backed securities 
we have no other off balance sheet transactions 
inventory our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method first in  first out basis 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory 
to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down  we considered current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we also reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes 
our retail stores record revenue at the point of sale 
our catalog and internet sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon estimated delivery to the customer 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  we estimate the amount of goods that will be returned and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly 
we utilize historical return patterns  which have remained consistent year over year  to estimate our expected returns 
vendor allowances we receive allowances from merchandise vendors for purchase price adjustments  cooperative advertising programs  cosmetic selling expenses and vendor sponsored contests 
purchase price adjustments are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales after an agreement with the vendor is executed and the related merchandise has been sold 
allowances for cooperative advertising programs and vendor sponsored contests are recorded in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred 
allowances for cosmetic selling expenses are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred 
any allowances in excess of actual costs incurred that are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 
self insurance we retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to health and welfare  workers compensation and general liability claims 
liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported 
we estimate our ultimate cost based on internal analysis of historical data and independent actuarial estimates 
we experienced an increase in our california workers compensation costs in and and declining costs in our total workers compensation costs over the last three years have been   and  in   and allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our private label credit card receivable as of the balance sheet date 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on several factors  including historical trends of aging of accounts  write off experience and expectations of future performance 
we recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off 
delinquent accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible  usually after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
our write off experience and aging trends have improved each of the last three years 
intangible asset impairment testing we review our goodwill and acquired tradename annually for impairment in the first quarter or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the goodwill and acquired tradename associated with our fa onnable business are our largest impairment risk 
in  we engaged an independent valuation specialist to estimate the reporting unit s fair value 
leases we lease the land or the land and building at many of our full line stores  and we lease the building at many of our rack stores 
additionally  we lease office facilities  warehouses and equipment 
we recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
in  we corrected our lease accounting policy to recognize lease expense  net of property incentives  from the time that we control the leased property 
we recorded a charge of million million net of tax in the fourth quarter of to correct this accounting policy 
the impact of this change was immaterial to prior periods 
many of our leases include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment period  subject to terms agreed to at lease inception 
for leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases  we record the difference between the rent expense and the rental amount payable under the leases in liabilities 
some leases require additional payments based on sales and are recorded in rent expense when the contingent rent is probable 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that fixed overhead production be allocated to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   and should be applied prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of under the modified prospective method 
we believe adoption of sfas no 
r will reduce our diluted earnings per share by

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
in seeking to minimize risk  we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
interest rate exposure is managed through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings 
short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates  but because they have maturities of three months or less  we believe that the risk of material loss was low  and that the carrying amount approximated fair value 
the table below presents information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  which consist of debt obligations and interest rate swaps for the year ended january  for debt obligations  the table presents principal amounts  at book value  by maturity date  and related weighted average interest rates

foreign currency gains and losses from the translation of fa onnable s balance sheet and income statement are included in other comprehensive earnings 
foreign currency gains or losses from certain intercompany loans are recorded in other income including finance charges  net 
we considered the potential impact of a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates and we believe that such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk 
the model measured the change in cash flows arising from the adverse change in foreign exchange rates  and covered long term debt denominated in euros
