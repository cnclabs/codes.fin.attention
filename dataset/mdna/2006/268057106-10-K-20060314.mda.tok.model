overview drc  founded in and headquartered in andover  massachusetts  provides information technology it  engineering and other services focused on national defense and intelligence  public safety and citizen services for government customers 
the government market is composed of three sectors national defense and intelligence  federal civilian agencies  and state and local governments 
the company s core capabilities are focused on information technology  engineering and technical subject matter expertise that pertain to the knowledge domains of the company s core customers 
according to a report published by input  inc  a leading research firm specializing in the market for government contractors  the federal market demand for vendor furnished information systems and services will increase from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of 
the fiscal year mid session review of the federal budget  submitted to congress by the us office of management and budget  shows the fiscal discretionary budgets for national defense of billion  an increase of approximately from fiscal year in the state and local government sector  datamonitor  an independent market analysis company  estimates state and local technology spending will grow from a combined billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal total revenue in was million  an increase of over the increase was a result of the acquisition of impact innovation llc impact innovations on september  the company experienced a slowdown in government procurement schedules and contract awards in this  coupled with a very competitive washington area employment market  has negatively impacted organic growth 
the estimated first year revenues to be derived from the company s new business awards in were approximately million  down from million in the company believes the delays relate  directly or indirectly  to funding needs for the war in iraq 
the company s contracts with the aeronautical systems center asc  the air force electronic systems center esc and the internal revenue service irs  which provided approximately million  million and million  respectively  of revenues in the year  and million  million and million  respectively  of revenues in the year  were subject to re competition in the services provided under the asc blanket purchase agreement were subject to re competition in as the consolidated acquisition of professional services caps contract 
the competition for prime contract awards was restricted to small businesses 
the company participated in the competition through hj ford  its wholly owned subsidiary 
hj ford along with hmr tech has formed a small business joint venture for this competition 
hj ford and hmr tech are participants in the us small business administration mentor prot g program 
the company currently anticipates awards on the caps contract will occur late in the first quarter or second quarter of with the transition of task orders to the new contract occurring throughout the balance of and into early there can be no assurance that the company s joint venture will succeed in obtaining the contract award 
the company anticipates if the joint venture is awarded the caps contract  that a successful transition to caps via the joint venture would enable drc to retain and preserve profits on substantially its entire labor base currently supporting these customers 
the company currently derives approximately million of annual revenues from work performed by subcontractors under the company s prime contract with the asc 
upon completion of the transition of task orders from the current contract to the new caps contract  if it is awarded to the joint venture  it is anticipated that the company s current subcontractors would contract directly with the joint venture prime contractor entity 
as a result it is estimated that  if the 
table of contents caps contract is awarded to the joint venture  upon the completion of the task order transitions  the company s annual revenue would be reduced by approximately million while positively affecting the profit margin percent of the remaining revenue 
the services provided under the esc contract were originally scheduled for re competition in the re competition was delayed 
it is currently anticipated that the competition for a portion of the work to be performed for esc will be full and open to all qualified contractors and the competition for the remainder of the work will be restricted to small businesses 
it is now anticipated that the government contract award and initial task order transitions will occur in late the company expects to participate in the competition primarily as a sub contractor to a qualified small business and that a successful re competition would enable drc to retain and preserve profits on substantially its entire labor base currently supporting these customers  which is expected to increase profit margins 
the full year revenue impact of moving from prime contractor to a sub contractor role is anticipated to be an approximate million revenue reduction 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in receiving the esc contract award 
the base contract agreement covering the company s work with the irs was the subject of re competition in the company s current task orders have been extended through may contract awards were announced in the fourth quarter of the company did not receive a new base contract award 
after may  the company anticipates continuing work with the irs either through a united states general services administration gsa schedule contract or as a sub contractor 
as a result of this transition  the company anticipates that about million of sub contractor revenues reflected in revenues will no longer be included in company revenues 
the company s gross margin increased to of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in the improvement in the gross margin was primarily a result of lower employee benefit costs and acquisition integration efficiencies 
operating income for was million an increase of over the operating margin for was of total revenue  compared to of total revenue in the improvement in the operating margin was primarily due to indirect overhead costs  employee benefit costs and general and administrative expenses increasing at a slower rate than revenues 
during  the company recorded a pretax gain of million from the sale of lucent shares 
net income in was million compared to million in the company has two reportable business segments systems and services  and metrigraphics 
the systems and services segment accounted for of total revenue and the metrigraphics segment accounted for of total revenue in critical accounting policies there are business risks specific to the industries in which the company operates 
these risks include  but are not limited to estimates of costs to complete contract obligations  changes in government policies and procedures  government contracting issues and risks associated with technological development 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions and changes in business strategy or market conditions may significantly impact the company s assets or liabilities  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments made and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s systems and services business segment provides its services pursuant to time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in 
table of contents time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which would directly affect operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of certain costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have not had a material impact on the company s revenue and operating income 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method or  for certain short term contracts  by the completed contract method  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the risk to the company on a fixed price contract is that if estimates to complete the contract change from one period to the next  profit levels will vary from period to period 
for all types of contracts  the company recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in contract revenue and cost of contract revenue 
unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process are the amounts of recoverable contract revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
generally  the company s unbilled expenditures and fees relate to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings  or delayed for other reasons 
billings which must be deferred more than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent assets 
costs related to certain united states government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been recorded at amounts the company expects to realize upon final settlement 
the company s metrigraphics business segment records revenue from product sales upon transfer of both title and risk of loss to the customer  provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of impact innovations and other business  the company has acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among other things  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant and reviews of projected cash flows 
as a result of the annual impairment test performed as of december   the company determined that the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  did not record a charge for impairment 
however  there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired in subsequent periods 
as of december   the company had recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and deferred taxes as part of the company s process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and future taxable income for purposes of assessing the company s ability to realize any future benefits from deferred taxes 
this process involves estimating the current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company had a net deferred liability of million at december  
table of contents the company must also assess the likelihood that its deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent a recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at december   the company determined that a valuation allowance was not required 
pensions accounting and reporting for the company s pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including but not limited to  discount rate  fixed annual compensation increase and expected rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are used by independent actuaries to estimate the total benefit ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuary assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is determined by a spot rate yield curve method 
the spot rate yield curve is adjusted to match the plan assets cash outflows with the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments 
as of december   the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations was and the weighted average discount rate to determine net periodic benefit costs was 
the assumed expected rate of return on plan assets  which is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants  is determined by an annual review of historical plan assets returns and consulting with outside investment advisors 
as of december  the weighted average expected rate of return was 
a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return would increase the annual pension expense by approximately million in during  the assumptions used in determining net periodic cost were consistent to actual results 
if these assumptions differ materially from actual results in the future  the company s obligations under the pension plan could also differ materially  potentially requiring the company to record an additional pension liability and record additional pension costs 
an actuarial valuation of the pension plan is performed each year 
the results of this actuarial valuation are reflected in the accounting for the pension plan upon determination 
at december   the company recorded a pension liability of million in the consolidated balance sheets that represented the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation
