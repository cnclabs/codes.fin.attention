item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and sells digital video systems and fiber optic systems that enable network operators to provide a range of interactive and advanced digital services that include digital video  vod  hdtv  high speed internet access and telephony 
our digital video systems enable our customers to process video for distribution over cable  satellite  telephone and wireless networks 
we also provide fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators and to certain telephone companies that offer video services to their customers 
in order to further expand our digital systems capability  harmonic acquired c cube microsystems inc s divicom business in may  which provided encoding products and systems for digital television 
from the completion of the merger until the end of  harmonic was organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks  or ban  for fiber optic systems and convergent systems  or cs  for digital headend systems 
in the fourth quarter of  harmonic announced a restructuring that included combining the two divisions and the manufacturing operations into a single segment  effective january  harmonic s net sales increased and in and  respectively  and decreased in although industry capital spending has been generally weak as compared to the pre merger levels that benefited harmonic and divicom in and early  we believe that the sequential increases in net sales in and reflected an improved industry capital spending environment worldwide which favorably impacted harmonic 
we believe that this improvement in the industry capital spending environment is  in part  a result of the intensifying competition between cable and satellite operators to offer more channels of digital video and new services  such as vod and hdtv  and in part the result of the entry of telephone companies into the business of delivering video services to their subscribers 
we also believe that the improvement is due to more favorable conditions in industry capital markets and the completion or resolution of certain major business combinations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly due to revenue recognition policies and the timing of the receipt of orders 
for example  revenue from two significant customer orders in the third quarter of was delayed due to these factors until the fourth quarter of historically  a majority of our net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
sales to comcast accounted for  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
in   and  sales of ban products accounted for approximately   and of net sales  respectively  while cs products accounted for approximately   and of net sales  respectively 
sales to customers outside of the us in   and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in  annual growth in net sales was but our operating results were negatively impacted by a decrease in the gross margin percentage  primarily the result of lower margin on fttp sales and sales of third party products  as well as the write down of inventories  resulting in a net loss of million for the year 
our operating results in also included a charge of million for severance costs from the consolidation of the two divisions and the manufacturing operation into a single operating segment  and a benefit of million from the reversal of previously recorded excess facility costs due to subleasing an excess facility 
in  annual growth in net sales of  improved gross margins  and operating expense growth of enabled harmonic to report net income of million  compared to a net loss of million in our operating results in included credits of million for products sold during the year which had been written down in prior years 
our operating results for included a charge to general and administrative expense of approximately million related to the settlement of litigation with power and telephone supply p t in release of all outstanding claims 
these claims arose from the cancellation of purchase orders on p t by one of its end customers in our operating results for also included credits to operating expenses totaling approximately million from the sale of our bankruptcy claims against adelphia communications resulting in the reversal of previously recorded bad debt provisions  and credits of million for products sold during the year which had been written down in prior years 
as a result of uncertain market conditions and lower sales during and  we implemented a series of cost control measures that included workforce reductions totaling approximately employees during the second half of we recorded severance charges of million during the second half of related to severance and other costs 
this followed a workforce reduction of approximately during for which we recorded severance and other costs of million 
these actions reduced headcount from over  at the end of to at the end of we further reduced headcount to in  mainly by attrition  but the improved business environment in led us to increase headcount to at the end of in  we added employees as a result of the acquisition of btl 
in the fourth quarter of  due to an organizational restructuring that combined our product development  marketing and manufacturing operations into a single segment  harmonic reduced its workforce by approximately employees and recorded severance charges of approximately million 
in light of our reduced headcount  difficult business conditions  and a weak local commercial real estate market  we reassessed our accrual for the costs of excess facilities and recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of we changed our estimates with regard to the expected timing and amount of sublease income due to the substantial and growing surplus of vacant space in the san francisco bay area 
the excess facilities charge recorded during the third quarter of was for facilities that we no longer occupy  do not intend to occupy  and have subleased  or plan to sublease  and followed charges of million recorded for excess facilities in when the initial accruals were established 
a review performed in the third quarter of resulted in the excess facilities liability being decreased by million due to a revision in the assumptions as to the unoccupied portion of a building 
we removed approximately  square feet of space from the excess facilities portfolio in order to eliminate a third party offsite storage arrangement 
based on the remaining lease term of months  this removal resulted in a reduction of million in the required excess facilities reserve 
this revision was offset by a correction of straight line rent expense of million as a result of a lease extension on another building 
this lease extension was a condition of leasing three additional buildings at corporate headquarters and resulted in all leases terminating in september the deferred rent liability was not adjusted for the change in the lease term resulting in an understatement of rent expense and the deferred rent liability at december   and because the effect of the correction on any quarter or year was not material to these results of operations and financial condition  the non cash adjustment was recorded in 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of  the excess facilities liability was decreased by million due to subleasing a portion of the unoccupied portion of one building for the remainder of the lease 
although we entered into new subleases for approximately  square feet of space in and approximately  square feet of space in  in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability  which could materially impact our financial position  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
harmonic often recognizes a significant portion  or the majority  of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
in the fourth quarter of  harmonic sold and issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to harmonic were approximately million  which was net of underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million and related legal  accounting  printing and other expenses totaling approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including payment of existing liabilities  research and development  the development or acquisition of new products or technologies  equipment acquisitions  strategic acquisitions of businesses  general working capital and operating expenses 
the offering was made pursuant to our registration statement on form s file no 
filed with the sec on march   as amended on april  and as declared effective on april   and the related prospectus supplement filed with the sec on october  in april  we filed another registration statement on form s with the sec 
pursuant to these registration statements on form s  which have been declared effective by the sec  we are able to issue various types of registered securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of approximately million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
on february   harmonic purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of broadcast technology ltd  a private uk company  for a total purchase consideration of million  or approximately million 
the purchase consideration consisted of a payment of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of harmonic common stock 
broadcast technology ltd 
develops  manufactures and distributes professional video audio receivers and decoders and had employees at the time of the acquisition 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made

revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from sales of hardware products  software products  solution sales  services and hardware and software maintenance agreements 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we account for the product as a software product 
revenue on software products and software related elements is recognized in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
revenue from hardware product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
subject to other revenue recognition provisions  revenue on product sales is recognized when risk of loss and title has transferred  which is generally upon shipment or delivery  based on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally recognized on delivery or sell in 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific capital equipment projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our equipment to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we have had extensive experience monitoring product returns from our international distributors and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
with respect to these sales  we evaluate the terms of sale and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred 
when arrangements contain multiple elements  harmonic evaluates all deliverables in the arrangement at the outset of the arrangement based on the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the undelivered elements qualify as separate units of accounting based on the criteria in eitf  which include that the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements  harmonic allocates the arrangement fee based on the relative fair value of the elements of the arrangement 
if a delivered element does not meet the 
table of contents criteria in eitf to be considered a separate unit of accounting  revenue is deferred until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
accordingly  the determination as to whether appropriate objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists can impact the timing of revenue recognition for an arrangement 
for multiple element arrangements that include both hardware products and software products  harmonic evaluates the arrangement based on eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf  the arrangement is divided between software related elements and non software deliverables 
software related elements are accounted for as software 
software related elements include all non software deliverables for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality 
when software arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  harmonic accounts for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop no 
fair value of software related elements is based on separate sales to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
revenue on solution sales  which principally consist of and include the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of equipment to the specifications of harmonic s customers  including equipment acquired from third parties to be integrated with harmonic s products  is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction production contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor costs expended to date to anticipated final labor costs  based on current estimates of labor costs to complete the project 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized  net of deferred costs of sales 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor costs to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position or cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
revenue from hardware and software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
first year maintenance typically is included in the original arrangement and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
services revenue is recognized on performance of the services and costs associated with services are recognized as incurred 
fair value of services such as consulting and training is based upon separate sales of these services 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
because of the concentrated nature of our customer base  different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract or customer could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
at december   our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts totaled million 

table of contents valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we writedown the cost of excess or obsolete inventory to net realizable value based on future demand forecasts and historical demand 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management is of critical importance in order to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
impairment of goodwill or long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis and of intangibles and other long lived assets whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of other intangible assets and long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles  goodwill or long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
at december   our carrying values for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities for restructuring activities initiated prior to december  we recorded restructuring costs when harmonic committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
to determine our excess facility accruals we estimate expected sublease rental income on each excess facility 
in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability which could materially impact our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
at december   our accrual for excess facilities totaled million 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on harmonic s review of the complaints filed in the securities class action and other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it either has meritorious defenses with respect to those actions and claims or is unable to predict the impact of an adverse action and  accordingly  no loss contingencies have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results or cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
based on our judgment that the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is not assured  we increased the valuation allowance to million in  decreased to million in and increased to million in at december  we have fully reserved for our net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected

under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remained outstanding at december  and are included in accrued liabilities 
these liabilities represent estimates of c cube s pre merger tax obligations to various tax authorities in countries 
we are working with lsi logic  which acquired the spun off semiconductor business in june and assumed its obligations  to settle these obligations  a process which has been underway since the merger in although we expect to make payments in for these tax liabilities  harmonic is unable to predict when the remaining obligations will be paid  or in what amount 
the full amount of the estimated obligation has been classified as a current liability 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amounts provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the tax sharing agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
conversely  if the settlements are more than the million pre merger tax liability  lsi is obligated to reimburse harmonic 
harmonic has a bank line of credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides for borrowings of up to million  including million for equipment under a secured term loan 
this facility  which was amended and restated in december  expires in december and contains financial and other covenants including the requirement for harmonic to maintain cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of credit extensions  of not less than million 
if harmonic is unable to maintain this cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance or 
table of contents satisfy the additional affirmative covenant requirements  harmonic would be in noncompliance with the facility 
in the event of noncompliance by harmonic with the covenants under the facility  silicon valley bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the facility which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable and disposing of the collateral if obligations were not repaid 
at december   harmonic was in compliance with the covenants under this line of credit facility 
the december amendment resulted in the company paying a fee of approximately  and requiring payment of approximately  of additional fees if the company does not maintain an unrestricted deposit of million with the bank 
future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  or prime plus for equipment borrowings 
borrowings are repayable monthly and are collateralized by all of harmonic s assets except intellectual property 
as of december   million was outstanding under the equipment term loan portion of this facility and there were no borrowings in the term loan is payable monthly  including principal and interest at per annum on outstanding borrowings as of december  and matures at various dates through december other than standby letters of credit and guarantees note  there were no other outstanding borrowings or commitments under the line of credit facility as of december  harmonic s cash and investment balances at december  were million 
we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including our bank line of credit facility  will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations or estimates change or prove inaccurate  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
the completed stock offering in the fourth quarter of was part of a registration statement on form s declared effective by the sec in april in april  we filed another registration statement on form s with the sec

harmonic indemnifies some of its suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
there have been no claims for indemnification and  accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at december  in addition  we actively review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  as well as conditions in capital markets and the cable and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all
