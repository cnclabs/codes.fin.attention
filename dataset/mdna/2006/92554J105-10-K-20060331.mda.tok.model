item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing at the end of this report 
this discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking 
table of contents statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the risk factors that may affect results section of this report 
overview viacell is a biotechnology company dedicated to researching  developing and commercializing cellular therapies 
we have a pipeline of proprietary umbilical cord blood derived and adult derived stem cell product candidates being studied as possible treatments for cancer  cardiac disease and diabetes 
we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial of cb  our lead umbilical cord blood derived stem cell therapy product candidate as a possible treatment for hematopoietic stem cell reconstitution in patients affected by a variety of cancers 
in addition to our therapeutic research and development programs  we have a reproductive health business unit that generated revenues of million in from sales of viacord  a product offering through which expectant families can preserve their baby s umbilical cord blood for possible future medical use 
we are working to leverage our commercial infrastructure and product development capabilities by developing viacyte sm  our investigational product candidate intended to broaden reproductive choices for women through the cryopreservation of human unfertilized eggs 
our management currently uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance 
we have determined that we conduct operations in one business segment 
the majority of our revenues since inception have been generated in the united states  and the majority of our long lived assets are located in the united states 
revenues our current revenues are derived primarily from fees charged to families for the preservation and storage of a child s umbilical cord blood collected at birth 
these fees consist of an initial fee for collection  processing and freezing of the umbilical cord blood and an annual storage fee 
the annual storage fee provides a growing annuity of future revenue as the number of stored umbilical cords increases 
our revenues are recorded net of discounts and rebates that we offer our customers under certain circumstances from time to time 
our revenues have increased substantially over the last several years as cord blood banking has gained increased popularity  however  we are unable to predict our future revenues from our umbilical cord blood business 
we offer our customers the opportunity to pay their fees directly to us or to finance them with a third party credit provider 
the majority of our customers owe their fees directly to us  accordingly we assume the risk of losses due to unpaid accounts 
we maintain a reserve for doubtful accounts to allow for this exposure and consider the amount of this reserve to be adequate at december  we are in ongoing litigation with pharmastem therapeutics over pharmastem s claims that our cord blood preservation business infringes certain of pharmastem s patents 
in the second half of  the delaware district court overturned a jury verdict of infringement against us in such suit 
as a result of this ruling  we do not expect the pharmastem litigation to have a materially adverse impact on our net sales  revenues or income from continuing operations 
however  pharmastem has appealed the court s decision and has also filed a new suit claiming that we infringe additional patents 
should we ultimately lose the appeal  or the additional ongoing litigation with pharmastem  it could have a material adverse effect on our net sales  revenues or income from continuing operations  including  possibly  resulting in an injunction preventing us from operating our cord blood preservation business 
in addition to the revenues generated by our viacord product  we recorded revenues in the periods presented from grant agreements with both the governments of singapore and germany 
we maintain a research facility in singapore 
we closed our german research facility in december  and have transitioned the research activities performed there to the united states 
as a result  revenues from grants in germany have ceased as of december  
table of contents operating expenses cost of processing and storage revenues reflects the cost of transporting  testing  processing and storing umbilical cord blood at our cord blood processing facility in hebron  kentucky  as well as  for certain periods  an accrual of a royalty to pharmastem relating to ongoing patent infringement litigation 
our cost of processing and storage revenues also includes expenses incurred by third party vendors relating to the transportation of cord blood to our processing facility and certain assay testing performed by a third party on the cord blood before preservation 
other variable costs include collection materials  labor  and processing and storage supplies  while other fixed costs include rent  utilities and other general facility overhead expenses 
cost of processing and storage revenues does not include costs associated with our grant revenue 
such costs are included in research and development expense 
we recorded a royalty expense of million in following an unfavorable jury verdict in the pharmastem litigation in october in  the district court overturned the jury verdict 
based on the judge s ruling  we reversed the entire royalty accrual in and have not recorded any royalties since such date 
pharmastem has appealed the district court s ruling 
pharmastem has also filed a new lawsuit claiming that we infringe additional patents 
pending a decision on the appeal and further action by the court on the new litigation  we do not intend to record a royalty expense in future periods  since we believe pharmastem s claims are without merit 
it is possible that the final outcome of these litigations could result in damages payable for infringement of pharmastem s patents  at a higher or lower amount than previously awarded by the jury in delaware 
should this occur  our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected 
we may enter into settlement negotiations with pharmastem regarding the litigation 
if a settlement agreement were entered into  we do not know whether it would provide for a payment by us of an ongoing royalty or payment of other amounts by us to pharmastem  or what those amounts might be 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the continued development of our lead stem cell product candidate  cb  our expansion technologies  including selective amplification  our other cellular therapy product candidates and viacyte  our oocyte cryopreservation product candidate 
these expenses represent both clinical development costs and costs associated with non clinical support activities such as toxicological testing  manufacturing  process development and regulatory services 
the cost of our research and development staff is the most significant category of expense  however we also incur expenses for external service providers  including preclinical studies and consulting expenses 
the major expenses relating to our cb clinical trial include external services provided for outside quality control testing  clinical trial monitoring  data management  and fees relating to the general administration of the clinical trial 
other direct expenses relating to our cb clinical trial include site costs and the cost of the cord blood 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we add personnel  expand our clinical trial activities and increase our discovery research and clinical and regulatory capabilities 
the amount of these increases is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in our research  development and manufacturing programs and activities  the timing and scope of our clinical trials  the rate of patient enrollment in our clinical trials  and the detailed design of future clinical trials 
in addition  the results from our clinical trials  as well as the results of trials of similar therapeutics under development by others  will influence the number  size and duration of planned and unplanned trials 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the results of our product candidate programs  all of which are currently in early stages 
based on these assessments  for each program  we consider options including  but not limited to  terminating the program  funding continuing research and development with the eventual aim of commercializing products  or licensing the program to third parties 
our sales and marketing expenses relate to our viacell reproductive health business 
the majority of these costs relate to our sales force and support personnel  as well as telecommunications expense related to our call center 
we also incur external costs associated with advertising  direct mail  promotional and other marketing services 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we expand our sales and marketing efforts 

table of contents our general and administrative expenses include our costs related to the finance  legal  human resources  business development  investor relations and corporate governance areas 
these costs consist primarily of expenses related to our staff  as well as external fees paid to our legal and financial advisors  business consultants and others 
we expect that these costs will increase in future years as we expand our business activities and as we incur additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
in september  we restructured our operations to reduce operating expenses and concentrate resources on our viacord product offering and three key products and product candidates 
as a result  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to employee severance  contractual termination fees and the write down of excess equipment 
in december we restructured our german operations and sub leased our german facility to a third party 
as a result we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of  including facility costs of million and million related to a contract termination fee 
the majority of the facility related costs consists of the write off of the leasehold improvements and fixed assets in our german facility  as well as the future minimum lease payments related to the facility 
the amount of this write off was partially reduced by the minimum future lease payments receivable from the sub lessee 
we are finalizing discussions with the german grant authorities regarding repayment of part of certain grants made to our german subsidiary in and we were notified that approximately  in grant proceeds related to fixed asset and operating expenditures in germany were not reimbursable under the grant and would have to be repaid 
as a result  we reserved an additional  during the year ended december  for our estimated liability under this grant 
the additional reserves resulted in reversals of grant revenue of approximately  for the year ended december  in addition  we reclassified approximately  of accrued restructuring reserves to reduce outstanding grants receivable 
in february we were notified by the state of north rhine westfalia  germany that it plans on performing an audit of the state s economic grants throughout its territory  including the grant to kourion 
it is possible that the grant authorities could request additional repayment of grant funds related to certain operating expenses that were previously funded by the grant authorities for research performed in germany  however we consider this possibility to be remote 
as of december  we had received approximately million in cumulative grant proceeds from the german grant authorities 
results of operations years ended december   and amounts in millions  year over year changes based on rounded amounts in millions change change change change to to to to processing revenues storage revenues total processing and storage revenues grant and contract revenues total revenues the increases in processing revenues of million or from to and million or from to are due primarily to an increase in the total number of umbilical cords processed  as well as a slight increase in the average selling price for processing 
the increase in storage revenues of million or from to and million or from to are due primarily to increases in the number of umbilical cords stored  as well as a slight increase in the average selling price for storage 
the decrease in grant and contract revenues of million or from to was primarily due to the decrease of million in grant revenues from german grant authorities following cessation of our operations in germany in and a decrease in contract revenues derived from research activities in the 
table of contents united states of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in grant revenues from the government of singapore of million 
the increase in grant and contract revenues of million or from to was primarily due to the inclusion of german grant revenue of million attributable to the acquisition of kourion therapeutics on september  change change change change to to to to cost of processing and storage revenues direct costs royalty expense total cost of processing and storage revenues the increases in direct costs of million or from to and million or from to were due primarily to increases in variable expenses related to the increased number of umbilical cords processed and number of umbilical cords stored 
these variable expenses relate to transportation of the cord blood and materials for related collection and testing of the umbilical cord blood 
the royalty expense of million in was due to our accrual of million in connection with the pharmastem lawsuit  to cover our cumulative royalty expense from august through december  following the jury verdict that was announced in october the jury verdict of infringement was overturned by the district court judge in the second half of and a credit to royalty expense of million was recorded in while pharmastem has appealed the district court s ruling  we continue to believe that the lawsuit is without merit and  in light of the judge s ruling  have determined that no royalty accrual or expense is required 
change change change change to to to to clinical development pre clinical programs basic research other r d total research and development clinical development expense is related primarily to outside services and clinical trial expenses for cb the increases in clinical development expense of million or from to and million or from to reflected the increasing cost of conducting the phase i clinical trial that commenced in late the decrease in costs associated with preclinical programs of million or from to was primarily due to the closure of our german research operations in december  and the discontinuation of our muscular dystrophy program in september these changes resulted in lower ongoing employee and facility related costs 
the increase in costs associated with preclinical programs of million or from to was primarily due to a complete year of expenses for our german research operations following the acquisition of kourion therapeutics in september the decrease in basic research expense was primarily related to the reduced facility and employee related costs associated with the closure of our cambridge research facility as we consolidated our general research activities into our singapore research center 
other research and development expense related primarily to our umbilical cord blood processing and storage business 

table of contents change change change change to to to to sales and marketing the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million or from to was primarily related to increased staffing within both the internal and external sales organization and increased external marketing program spending to strengthen our market presence 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses of million or from to was primarily due to cost savings attributed to a reduction in the number of internal sales employees following the implementation of call center automation technology 
change change change change to to to to general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million or from to was primarily due to a decrease in employee related costs of million as a result of our restructuring in september as well as a decrease in consulting costs of million  and a decrease in litigation expenses of million relating to the pharmastem lawsuit  partially offset by increased accounting fees and outside service fees of million and increased insurance premiums of million associated with being a public company 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million or from to was due primarily to the decrease in litigation expenses of million  relating to the pharmastem lawsuit  a decrease in transaction costs of million relating to the acquisition of kourion therapeutics in september  and a reduction in bad debt expense of million due to continued improvements in our collection efforts in these decreases were offset by additional consulting costs related to our viacyte program of million  an increase in general legal costs of million  an increase of million relating to additional accounting and audit fees related to quarterly reviews in preparation for our ipo  and increased employee related costs of million  primarily due to employee severance and payroll increases related to exiting employees 
change change change change to to to to in process technology n a no in process technology expenses were incurred in and the expense in consisted primarily of the portion of the kourion therapeutics purchase price allocated to acquired in process technology  representing million 
in addition  million represented the stem cell growth factor technology licensed from amgen  and million related to technology licensed from glaxosmithkline 
change change change change to to to to stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is primarily due to the amortization of the excess of the fair value on the date of the grant of the stock underlying the options granted to employees  over the exercise price 
the amortization is based on the vesting period of the related options and relates primarily to options granted prior to our ipo 
during the year ended december   we did not grant any options with exercise prices less than fair market value on the date of grant 
in july  our board of directors approved an increase  from days to three years  in the amount of time allowed for non employee directors to exercise vested options following termination of service to viacell 
as a result of this modification of the option terms  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense in the year ended december  we will record stock based compensation expense related to the unamortized deferred compensation associated with this option modification of approximately million in the years through based on respective vesting schedules associated with each modified option grant 
the amount of stock based compensation actually recognized in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 

table of contents the net decrease in stock based compensation expense from to was primarily related to the amortization of the deferred compensation account since no new options were granted with exercise prices less than fair market value in  partially offset by the additional stock based compensation expense related to the modified option terms 
the increase in stock based compensation expense from to was primarily due to million of additional stock based compensation expense incurred in related to the modification of employee options to extend the option exercise period for employees terminated in our restructuring 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb released sfas no 
r share based payment 
this new accounting standard requires all forms of stock compensation given to employees  including stock options  to be reflected as an expense in our financial statements 
public companies must adopt the standard by their first annual fiscal period beginning after june  we intend to apply the revised standard in the annual period beginning january  although we have not finalized our analysis  we expect that the adoption of the revised standard will result in higher operating expenses and higher net loss per share 
change change change change to to to to restructuring in september we restructured our operations to reduce operating expenses and concentrate our resources on four key products and product candidates

we expect to need to build or acquire another manufacturing facility in order to fully commercialize cb and our other product candidates  if successfully developed 
the timing and cost of such a facility is not known at this time  however the cost is likely to be substantial 
we also received proceeds of million related to the return of a security deposit which secured our long term debt obligations

we also have certain minimum annual purchase requirements starting in fiscal which will apply if our investigational product for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  cb  continues in clinical trials or is commercialized 
in january  we paid the first installment of approximately  for a quantity of the cell separation kits to be used in our research 
we are a party to various agreements in addition to those previously discussed  including license  research collaboration  consulting and employment agreements and expect to enter into additional agreements in the 
table of contents future 
we may require additional funds for conducting clinical trials and for preclinical research and development activities relating to our product candidates  as well as for the expansion of our cord blood preservation facility  construction of a cellular therapy manufacturing facility  acquisitions of technologies or businesses  the establishment of partnerships and collaborations complementary to our business and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards begin expiring in and  respectively 
we also had federal and state credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin expiring in and  respectively 
the internal revenue code places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized if certain changes in our ownership occur 
the company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million 
the carryforwards expire through and are subject to review and possible adjustment 
ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code  may have limited the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income 
legal proceedings in  pharmastem therapeutics  inc filed suit against us and several other defendants in the united states district court for the district of delaware  alleging infringement of us patents no 
 and no 
  relating to certain aspects of the collection  cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood 
we believe that we do not infringe these patents and that the patents are invalid 
in  a jury ruled against us and the other defendants  cbr systems inc  corcell  inc and cryo cell international inc  who represent a majority of the family cord blood preservation industry finding that the patents were valid and enforceable  and that the defendants infringed the patents 
a judgment was entered against us for approximately million  based on royalties on our revenue from the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood since april in  the district court judge in the case overturned the jury s verdict stating that pharmastem had failed to show infringement 
pharmastem has appealed the judge s decision 
we have appealed the jury s finding as to validity of the patents 
a hearing on the appeal is scheduled for april  in july  pharmastem filed a second complaint against us 
the second complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  alleging infringement of us patents no 
 and   which also relate to certain aspects of the collection  cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood 
we believe that the patents in this new action are invalid and that we do not infringe them in any event 
on january   pharmastem filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the massachusetts litigation 
that motion is currently stayed 
we believe the issues presented in this case are substantially the same as the issues presented in the original delaware litigation 
accordingly  we filed a motion to consolidate the massachusetts case with six other actions against other defendants in a single proceeding in the district of delaware 
on february   our request was granted 
the cases have been consolidated in delaware 
the us patent and trademark office us pto has ordered the re examination of both the method patent and the composition patent at issue in the first case and the and patents at issue in the second case based on prior art 
a second re examination of the patent was ordered in order to determine whether certain claims of the patent should expire in  rather than in final decisions on the re examinations have not yet been issued 
on october   the delaware court granted our motion to stay all discovery in the second lawsuit pending decisions from the federal circuit on pharmastem s appeal of the district court s ruling of non infringement in the original case and from the us pto on the patent re examinations 

table of contents in either of the pending cases  if we are ultimately found to infringe  we could have a significant damages award entered against us 
if we are found to infringe or at any other time during the course of either case  including possibly if the court of appeals were to overturn the district court s non infringement ruling  we could also face an injunction which could prohibit us from further engaging in the umbilical cord stem cell business absent a license from pharmastem 
pharmastem would be under no legal obligation to grant us a license or to do so on economically reasonable terms  and previously informed us that it would not do so october  while we do not believe this outcome is likely  in the event of an injunction  if we are not able to obtain a license under the disputed patents on economically reasonable terms or at all and we cannot operate under an equitable doctrine known as intervening rights  we will be required to stop preserving and storing cord blood and to cease using cryopreserved umbilical cord blood as a source for stem cell products 
we may enter into settlement negotiations with pharmastem regarding the litigation 
we cannot predict whether any such negotiations would lead to a settlement of these lawsuits or what the terms or timing of any such settlement might be  if it occurs at all 
on may   we received a first amended complaint filed in the superior court of the state of california by kenneth d 
worth  by and for the people of the state of california  and naming as defendants a number of private cord blood banks  including us 
the complaint alleges that the defendants have made fraudulent claims in connection with the marketing of their cord blood banking services and seeks restitution for those affected by such marketing  injunctive relief precluding the defendants from continuing to abusively and fraudulently market their services and requiring them to provide certain information and refunds to their customers  unspecified punitive and exemplary damages and attorney s fees and costs 
subsequently  we received a notice of ex parte application for leave to intervene filed on behalf of the cord blood foundation by the same individual and seeking similar relief 
on october   the court orally granted a motion to strike the complaint under the california anti slapp statute and dismissed the complaint as to all defendants without leave to amend 
judgment has been entered  dismissing the complaint  and plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal and a brief for the appeal and a petition for a writ of mandate 
the petition has been dismissed and the appeal is proceeding 
the plaintiff has settled the litigation with all defendants other than us 
we are not yet able to conclude as to the likelihood that plaintiff s claims would be upheld if the judgment of dismissal were reversed on appeal  nor can we estimate the possible financial consequences should plaintiff prevail 
however  we believe this suit to be without merit and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves 
on february   cbr systems  inc  a private cord blood banking company  filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging false and misleading advertising by us in violation of the federal lanham act and various california statutes and common law and seeking an injunction from continuing such advertising and unspecified damages 
on april   we answered the complaint  denying cbr s allegations  and filed counterclaims alleging false and misleading advertising by cbr 
on october   we entered into an agreement to settle the pending litigation with cbr 
under terms of the agreement the companies agreed to dismiss all outstanding legal claims 
there were no financial payments to be made by either party under the settlement agreement 
we have undertaken a review of our various job classifications for legal compliance under state and federal employment laws 
based on that review  we have identified certain job classifications that may be subject to possible challenge  although there is currently no challenge pending  and for which there is a reasonable possibility that we could incur a liability  although we also believe that the present classifications can be supported and defended 
it is not possible based on the current available information to reasonably estimate the scope of any potential liability 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the 
table of contents carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for accounts receivable  accounting for royalty expense in connection with the pharmastem litigation  accounting for research and development expenses  accounting for our product guarantee program  and accounting for our physician indemnification program 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are currently generated principally through our umbilical cord blood preservation and storage activities 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab as amended by sab  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
for all revenue transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we receive fees for collecting  testing  freezing and storing of cord blood units and recognize revenue upon the successful completion of these processes 
storage revenue is deferred and recognized over the storage period 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements entered into after june  to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize fees received from collecting  testing and freezing processes collectively known as processing as revenue if it has stand alone value to the customer and the fair value of the undelivered storage services can be determined 
the company has concluded that the collection  testing and freezing service has stand alone value to the customer 
the fair value of processing service cannot be determined but the company has objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered storage 
the fair value of the storage is equal to the annual storage fee charged to customers 
we defer the fair value of the revenue related to the future storage of the unit and recognize the remainder of the revenue under the residual method 
accounting for accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consists of amounts primarily due from our viacord customers that have used the viacord product 
accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the allowance by considering receivables that are past due  our previous loss history  and the customers current ability to pay its obligations 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible and payments subsequently received on such accounts receivable are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for royalty expense in connection with the pharmastem litigation 
cost of revenues in includes a royalty to pharmastem relating to a claim for patent infringement 
we are currently in litigation with pharmastem regarding this claim 
we recorded a royalty expense of approximately million in following a jury verdict in october which found infringement 
this expense included a royalty of approximately million on revenues from cord blood preservation through october   plus an accrual of of subsequent revenues through december  we also recorded an expense of million for the three months ended march   also based on of revenues 
in the second half of  the court overturned the jury verdict finding that pharmastem had not shown infringement 
based on the judge s ruling we reversed the entire royalty accrual of million in the quarter ended june  pharmastem has appealed the court s decision 
pending further action by the courts  we do not intend to record a royalty expense in future periods  since we believe the claim is without merit 
it is possible that the final outcome of this litigation  as well as the final outcome of the second patent infringement lawsuit brought by pharmastem  could result in damages payable at a higher or lower amount than previously awarded by the delaware jury 
should this occur or should an injunction be issued at any time in either case  our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected 
we may enter into settlement negotiations with 
table of contents pharmastem regarding our litigation 
if a settlement agreement were entered into  we do not know whether it would provide for a payment by us of an ongoing royalty or payment of other amounts by us to pharmastem  or what those amounts might be 
accounting for research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with product development for cb  the development of selective amplification and our other stem cell therapy technologies and our oocyte cryopreservation program 
these expenses represent both clinical development costs and the costs associated with non clinical support activities such as toxicological testing  manufacturing  process development and regulatory consulting services 
clinical development costs represent internal costs for personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contracted payments to third party clinical research organizations to perform certain clinical trials 
we also report the costs of patent licenses in research and development expense as they directly relate to our ongoing research programs 
our product candidates do not currently have regulatory approval  accordingly  we expense the license fees and related milestone payments when we incur the liability 
we accrue research and development expenses for activities occurring during the fiscal period prior to receiving invoices from clinical sites and third party clinical research organizations 
we accrue external costs for clinical studies based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  progress by the enrolled patients through the trial  and contracted costs with clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development and external costs related to non clinical studies and basic research when incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual costs incurred may or may not match the estimated costs for a given accounting period 
we expect that expenses in the research and development category will increase for the foreseeable future as we add personnel  expand our clinical trial activities and increase our discovery research capabilities 
the amount of the increase is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing of clinical trial initiations  progress in our discovery research program  the rate of patient enrollment and the detailed design of future trials 
in addition  the results from our trials  as well as the results of trials of similar drugs under development by others  will influence the number  size and duration of both planned and unplanned trials 
accounting for our product guarantee program 
in november  we began providing our customers a product guarantee under which we agree to pay  to defray the costs associated with the original collection  storage of cord blood  and procurement of an alternative stem cell source  if medically indicated  in the event the customer s cord blood is used in a stem cell transplant and fails to engraft 
we have never experienced any claims under the guarantee program nor have we incurred costs related to these guarantees 
we do not maintain insurance for this guarantee program and therefore we maintain reserves to cover our estimated potential liabilities 
we account for the guarantee as a warranty obligation and recognize the obligation in accordance with sfas no  accounting for contingencies 
our reserve balance is based on the  maximum payment  multiplied by the number of units covered by the guarantee  multiplied by the expected transplant rate  multiplied by the expected engraftment failure rate 
we determine the expected usage and engraftment failure rate by analyzing data from our existing bank of cords  cords stored in published private and public banks and the related historical usage and failure rates in our bank and other private and public cord banks 
we determine the estimated expected usage and engraftment failure rates based on an analysis of our historical usage and failure rates and the historical usage and failure rates in other private and public cord banks based on published data 
our estimates of expected usage and engraftment failure could change as a result of changes in actual usage rates or failure rates and such changes would require an adjustment to our established reserves 
the historical usage and failure rates have been very low and a small increase in the number of transplants or engraftment failures could cause a significant increase in the estimated rates used in determining our reserve 
in addition  the reserve will increase as additional cord units are stored which are subject to the product guarantee 
we have reserves recorded under this program in the amounts of   and  as of december    and  respectively 
accounting for our physician indemnification program 
in september  we launched an indemnification program protecting physicians from patent litigation actions taken against them by pharmastem therapeutics  inc under this program we agreed to pay reasonable defense costs resulting from such litigation  providing that the physicians allowed us to manage their defense 
in addition  we agreed to pay all 
table of contents damages resulting from such litigation  and we agreed to pay an additional  to the physicians if pharmastem prevails in any patent infringement litigation against the physician 
in order to qualify for this indemnification the physicians are required to comply with certain requirements including returning a signed acknowledgement form around the particulars of the indemnification program 
we have recorded a reserve associated with this program of  in our december  and financial statements in compliance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the reserve is equal to the estimated fair value of the indemnification arrangements entered into as of december  and we have determined the reserve through a probability model based on assumptions related to the likelihood of legal ramifications  and the extent of those ramifications  applicable under this program for the potential professional fees  damages  and remunerations related to the agreements executed as of december  and these assumptions involve judgment by management and are subject to change as additional physicians enroll in the program  if the actual amount of patent litigation and related defense costs exceed our estimates or if pharmastem s patents are overturned by the us patent office 
we believe pharmastem has no legal basis to pursue patent litigation against physicians who assist in collecting cord blood on behalf of our customers 
however  our assumptions contemplate a wide range of possible outcomes including the possibility of pharmastem pursuing and prevailing in such patent litigation  although we believe the likelihood of this is remote 

recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb released sfas no 
r share based payment 
this new accounting standard requires all forms of stock compensation  including stock options  to be reflected as an expense in our financial statements 
public companies must adopt the standard by their first annual fiscal period beginning after june  we intend to apply the revised standard in the annual period beginning january  although we have not finalized our analysis  we expect that the adoption of the revised standard will result in higher operating expenses and higher net loss per share 
we will most likely use the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date of this new accounting pronouncement a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
note to the consolidated financial statements shows the pro forma impact on net loss and net loss per common share as if we had historically applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee awards 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and supersedes fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the provisions of the sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations
