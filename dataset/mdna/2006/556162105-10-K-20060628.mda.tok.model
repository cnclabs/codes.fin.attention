item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set out in part i general information  item a risk factors elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our business we are a leading provider of video game accessories and software marketed under the mad catz and gameshark brands

seasonality we generate a substantial percentage of our net sales in the last three months of every calendar year  our fiscal third quarter 
our quarterly results of operations can be expected to fluctuate significantly in the future  as a result of many factors  including seasonal influences on our sales  unpredictable consumer preferences and 
table of contents spending trends  the introduction of new video game platforms  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  and timing of introductions of new products 
see further discussion and sales by quarter under net sales below 
transition to next generation consoles our industry is cyclical and we believe it is now in a transition stage entering into the next cycle 
beginning with the release of microsoft s xbox in november and continuing with releases by sony and nintendo by the end of  we expect two new video game consoles to be introduced into the market 
upon release of the xbox we were a licensee with rights to officially market a full range of accessories compatible with the xbox continuing through this transition  we also intend to develop and market a range of accessories that are compatible with the new console systems to be introduced by sony and nintendo  as well as continue to provide accessories to the significant installed base of current consoles in the marketplace 
the transition of consoles provides an opportunity for us to market products to the value oriented consumer 
until we have had an opportunity to fully evaluate the technology used by the first party manufacturers  we will be unable to determine the extent to which we will be able to design and manufacture accessories that are compatible with all of the new video game consoles 
foreign currency approximately of our annual sales are transacted outside the united states 
the majority of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
in fiscal and fiscal  we did not hedge against foreign currency exposure and we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us during fiscal critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of our products  including interactive software licensed from third party developers 
we recognize revenue based on the applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and on the criteria set forth in statement of position  software revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue when each of the following have occurred there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  the products are delivered  which occurs when the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable 
our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net and day terms 

table of contents revenues from sales to authorized resellers are subject to terms allowing price protection  certain rights of return and allowances for customer marketing programs 
reserves for price protection are recorded when the price protection program is approved 
allowances for estimated future returns and customer marketing programs are provided for upon revenue recognition 
such amounts are estimated and periodically adjusted based on historical and anticipated rates of returns  inventory levels and other factors and are recorded as a reduction of revenue or operating expense in accordance with eitf customer marketing programs we record allowances for customer marketing programs  including certain rights of return  price protection  volume based cash incentives and cooperative advertising 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue or as an operating expense in the period we have sold the product or committed to the program 
significant management judgments and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
we grant limited rights of return for certain products 
estimates of expected future product returns are based on analyses of historical returns and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
consistent with industry standards and practices  on a product by product basis by customer  we allow price protection credits to be issued to retailers in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the price of a product as a result of reduction in competitive prices and issue credits to our customers to protect the customers from lower profit margins on their then current inventory of the product 
the decision to effect price reductions is influenced by retailer inventory levels  product lifecycle stage  market acceptance  competitive environment and new product introductions 
credits are issued based upon the number of units that customers have on hand at the date of the price reduction 
upon approval of a price protection program  reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established 
reserves are estimated based on analyses of qualified inventories on hand with retailers and distributors 
we enter into cooperative advertising arrangements with many of our customers allowing customers to receive a credit for various advertising programs 
the amounts of the credits are based on specific dollar value programs or a percentage of sales  depending on the terms of the program negotiated with the individual customer 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these advertising programs are recorded based on the specific negotiations with individual customers in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of these cooperative advertising program accruals 
we also offer volume rebates to several of our customers and record reserves for such rebates as a reduction of revenue at the time revenue is recognized 
estimates of required reserves are determined based on programs negotiated with the specific customers 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take action to increase customer programs and incentive offerings that could result in incremental reductions to revenue or increased operating expenses at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products in the united states and internationally primarily through retailers 
we generally do not require any collateral from our customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and by purchasing credit insurance on european accounts receivable balances 

table of contents we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which we believe is adequate 
the allowance is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as historical experience with bad debts  receivables aging and current economic trends 
our customer base is highly concentrated and a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition  or a decline in the general economic conditions could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
as of march   one customer formerly two customers who merged during the year represented and another customer represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the eight highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivables as of march  if any of these customer s receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel in order to recognize any loss of utility in the period incurred 
software development costs software development costs primarily consist of payments made to independent software developers under development agreements 
we account for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which provides for the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility of the software is established or for development costs that have alternative future uses 
under our current practice of developing new products  the technological feasibility of the underlying software is not established until substantially all product development is complete and the first playable version is delivered 
the software development costs that have been capitalized to date have been insignificant 
royalties and intellectual property licenses royalty and license expenses consist of royalties and license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks  copyrights  software  technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development or sale of our products 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our video game titles 
royalty based payments that are paid in advance are generally capitalized and expensed to cost of sales at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
with regard to payments made to independent software developers and co publishing affiliates  the company is generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of the product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred 
payments due after the general release of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of sales at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
valuation of goodwill we have recorded goodwill in connection with acquisitions completed in prior periods 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets prohibits amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives but instead requires testing for impairment at least annually 
we review goodwill for impairment as of april st of each fiscal year or when an event or a change in facts and or circumstances indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount 
we have completed our annual assessment of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 which did not indicate any impairment of goodwill as of march  and
