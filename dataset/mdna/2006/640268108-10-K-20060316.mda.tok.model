item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this report under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough products that make a difference in patients lives 
we create differentiated  innovative products by applying our drug delivery technologies to established or novel medicines 
our leading technologies are nektar pulmonary technology and nektar advanced pegylation technology 
to date  there have been nine products which have received regulatory approval in the us or eu 
we create or enable breakthrough products in two ways 
first  we develop products in collaboration with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek to improve and differentiate their products 
second  we apply our technologies to established medicines to create and develop our own differentiated  proprietary products 
our proprietary products are designed to target serious diseases in novel ways 
we believe our proprietary products have the potential to raise the standards of current patient care by improving efficacy  safety  and or ease of use 
the commercial success of exubera will be the key driver of our business in the next several years 
we expect our future revenues to come increasingly from the manufacture and sale of exubera inhalers and powdered insulin  and royalties from end product sales by pfizer inc the commercial success of exubera will be a significant factor in achieving our profitability objective and our ability to fund the key elements of our business strategy 
in addition  we expect to receive substantially less contract research and commercialization readiness revenue from pfizer inc as exubera transitions to the commercialization phase and therefore revenues from commercialization sales of exubera will be required to replace those revenue sources 
like any product in the pre launch phase  there are a number of uncertainties that remain  including the timing and success of the commercial launch of exubera by pfizer inc  physician and patient education and experiences  third party payor reimbursement  country specific pricing approvals  manufacturing and supply execution  and other risks and uncertainties identified in this report 
in addition  we plan to make significant investments in our proprietary product programs which will comprise a substantial portion of our research and development spending 
historically we have partnered with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the early development phase which has helped fund the investment of our product programs 
our strategy is to develop a portfolio of proprietary products that are intended to address critical unmet medical needs by exploiting our know how and technology in combination with established medicines 
our objective is to advance these products into clinical development and potentially through regulatory marketing approval thereby capturing significantly more economic value from these products 
this strategy requires us to make significant investments in early stage products where there is still substantial uncertainty regarding product efficacy  product safety  clinical results  regulatory approvals  competitive landscape  and market acceptance 
our decision as to when or whether to seek partners for our proprietary products will be made on a product by product basis and such decisions will have an important impact on our revenues  research and development spending  and financial position 
while we believe this strategy may result in improved economics for any products ultimately developed and approved  it will require us to invest significant funds in developing these products without reimbursement from a collaborative partner 
we will continue to seek collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our partnering strategy enables us to develop a large and diversified pipeline of drug products using our technologies 
as we continue to shift our focus towards our proprietary products programs  we expect to engage in a fewer number of higher value partnerships in order to optimize revenue potential  probability of success  and overall return on investment 
to date the revenues we have received from the sales of our partner products have 
table of contents been insufficient to meet our operating and other expenses 
other than revenues we expect to generate from exubera  we do not anticipate receiving sufficient amounts of revenue from other partner product sales or royalties in the near future to meet our operating expenses 
to fund the expense related to our research and development activities  we have raised significant amounts of capital through the sale of our equity and convertible debt securities 
as of december   we had approximately million in long term convertible subordinated notes  million in non current capital lease obligations  and million in other long term liabilities 
our ability to meet the repayment obligations of this debt is dependent upon our and our partners ability to develop  obtain regulatory approvals  and successfully commercialize products 
even if we are successful in this regard  we will likely require additional capital to repay our debt obligations 
recent developments in july  a complaint was filed by the board of trustees of the university of alabama uah against nektar therapeutics al  corporation  and nektar therapeutics in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama 
the complaint alleges patent infringement  breach of a contract royalty obligation  violation of the alabama trade secrets act  and unjust enrichment 
in august  uah amended its complaint to add j 
milton harris  a nektar employee  as a party to the litigation  add certain additional claims  seek declaratory judgment on patents assigned to the company  and seek compensatory  treble and punitive damages  all in unspecified amounts 
in december  uah filed its second amended complaint expanding its previously asserted claims that the company and harris had infringed patents of uah  misappropriated and taken intellectual property rightfully belonging to uah  concealed intellectual property from uah that was rightfully the property of uah  and converted these discoveries for their own profit notwithstanding that the company and harris were fully aware that the inventions rightfully belonged to uah 
uah further claimed fraudulent concealment  conversion  detinue  misrepresentation  conspiracy  and  as against harris  breach of express and implied contract and breach of an assignment of application 
uah is seeking equitable relief including declaratory judgment  the imposition of a constructive trust  specific performance  injunction  accounting and other relief on the theory that uah should be the record holder of certain patent s assigned to the company 
we have filed and continue to assert a counterclaim against uah seeking full refund of all royalty payments erroneously paid to uah under the patent at issue in the original complaint 
the litigation is at too early a stage to make an assessment about the probability of the outcome in the case 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation  however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in such defense 
in september we announced an agreement with subsidiaries of baxter international inc to develop pegylated therapeutic forms of blood clotting proteins for hemophilia a patients  in order to reduce the frequency of injections required to treat blood clotting disorders in such as hemophilia a 
baxter will be responsible for the development and commercialization of products and we will be responsible for the technology development used in the products including the provision of clinical and commercial peg reagents 
under the terms of the agreement  we will receive milestone payments  funding of r d  and manufacturing revenues during research  clinical development  and commercialization 
in addition  we will receive royalties on end product sales 
in september  we announced that we are developing an inhaled amphotericin b product for preventing fatal pulmonary fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients to reduce the incidence  morbidity  mortality and high cost of treating these infections 
we have conducted two phase i trials for abip and have long term toxicity studies underway to support pivotal trials that we plan to initiate in in september  we also announced that we are developing inhaled icu antibiotics for the prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia in the intensive care unit 
following the acquisition of aerogen in october  we combined our inhaled icu antibiotics program  which was in proof of concept for prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia  with aerogen s ongoing phase ii program that uses aerosolized amikacin to 
table of contents treat hospital pneumonias 
the new combined program will focus on adjunctive treatment of gram negative pneumonias in patients on mechanical ventilation 
a phase ii trial for our inhaled antibiotics program is underway 
in october  we announced the initiation of clinical testing in the phase iii program evaluating tip  an investigational inhaled antibiotic being developed in collaboration with chiron 
the tip phase iii program includes two clinical trials and will evaluate the efficacy and safety of tip in the treatment of lung infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients living with cystic fibrosis cf 
the first trial  called aspire i  is currently underway 
in october  we completed the acquisition of aerogen pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger dated august  the total purchase price for the transaction was approximately million  including million in cash consideration  plus expenses associated with the transaction and liabilities incurred by us resulting from the transaction 
we expensed approximately million of in process research and development expenses which were allocated from the purchase price in the year ended december  we believe that the acquisition of aerogen will broaden the nektar pulmonary technology portfolio and strengthen capabilities for treatment in the acute care setting 
on january   we announced that louis drapeau was appointed as our senior vice president  finance and chief financial officer and concurrently therewith ajay bansal resigned as chief financial officer  and vice president  finance and administration 
on january   pfizer inc announced that the european commission approved exubera inhaled human insulin for the treatment of adults with type and type diabetes 
on january   pfizer inc and the fda announced that exubera insulin human 
rdna origin 
inhalation powder had been approved by the fda for the treatment of adults with type and type diabetes 
on february   we announced that ajit s 
gill will be retiring and resigning as ceo  president  and director  effective as of march  on february   robert b 
chess  our current executive chairman and former ceo  was appointed as interim president and ceo  effective as of march  on february   we announced the fda had granted orphan drug designation for our proprietary product abip 
orphan products are developed to treat diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  people in the us the orphan drug act provides a seven year period of exclusive marketing to the first sponsor who obtains marketing approval for a designated indication for the orphan drug 
on march   ucb announced that it had submitted a biologics licensing application to the fda for the approval of cimzia certolizumab pegol  cdp for the treatment of patients with crohn s disease 
during  we announced new collaborative agreements separately with bayer healthcare llc  baxter international inc  and zelos therapeutics inc these collaborations are for various products that use our technologies and intellectual property and are in early stages of development 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb released fasb staff position fsp no 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp  effective january   provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when an impairment of debt and equity securities should be considered other than temporary  as well as the subsequent accounting for these investments 
the adoption of this fsp is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb released statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 fas 
fas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for any change in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the statement defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
the statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
the statement carries forward without change the guidance contained in opinion for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
we will be required to adopt fas for any accounting changes or corrections of errors on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payment sab that provides the sec staff position regarding the application of sfas no 
r 
sab contains interpretative guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for share based payment transactions 
we are currently reviewing the effect of sab on its condensed consolidated financial statements as it prepares to adopt sfas r 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb released a revision to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas r 
fas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we have adopted fas r commencing on january   and we expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and loss per share in we have elected to use the black scholes model for valuing our share based payments 
we also elected to follow the prospective adoption method when adopting sfas r 
we believe that the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of also in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of we do not expect the adoption of these new tax accounting standards to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb released sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment to arb no 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as defined by arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
for the reporting period ending march  we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of each of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board released a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas r 
fas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and instead would generally require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we have adopted fas r for all periods ending on or after january  as a result of our adoption of fas r  we will have to recognize substantially more compensation expense 
this will have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for periods ending on or prior to december   we applied the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for those plans 
under this opinion  no stock based employee compensation expense was charged for options that were granted at an exercise price that was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
stock compensation costs were immediately recognized to the extent the exercise price is below the fair value on the date of grant and no future vesting criteria exist 
for stock awards issued below our market price on the date of grant  we recorded deferred compensation representing the difference between the price per share of stock award issued and the fair value of the company s common stock at the time of issuance or grant  and we amortized this amount over the related vesting periods on a straight line basis 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share required by sfas  as amended by sfas  regarding the fair value for employee options and employee stock purchase plan shares was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility factor weighted average expected life years years years the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we have presented the pro forma net loss and pro forma basic and diluted net loss per common share using the assumptions noted above 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation in thousands  except per share information years ended december  revised revised net loss  as reported add stock based employee compensation included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value methods for all awards net loss  pro forma net loss per share basic and diluted  as reported basic and diluted  pro forma the revised reported pro forma net loss for the years ended december  and has been decreased by million and million  respectively  for options exchanged under stock option exchange programs and adjustments from computational corrections 
cash  cash equivalents and investments we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held in banks  interest bearing money market funds  commercial paper  federal and municipal government securities  and repurchase agreements 
investments consist of auction rate securities with varying maturities  and federal and municipal government securities  corporate bonds  and commercial paper with a  f  or p short term ratings and a or better long term ratings with remaining maturities at date of purchase of greater than days 
investments with maturities greater than one year are classified as long term and represent investments of cash that are reasonably expected to be realized in cash and are available for use  if needed  in current operations 
at december   all short term investments are designated as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
short term investments are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities  if any  are included in other income expense 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income 
at december  and  we had letter of credit arrangements with certain vendors including our landlord totaling million and million  respectively  which are secured by investments in similar amounts 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below our carrying value 

table of contents goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare our fair value to our net asset value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of net assets is greater than our book value of net assets  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value is less than our net asset value  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if they had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price 
the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities would be the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the business unit level  which we have identified as our pulmonary and proprietary business unit  our advanced pegylation technology business unit and our super critical fluids business unit 
we performed our annual impairment test for goodwill in october and determined at that time that the undiscounted cash flow from our long range forecast for each respective business unit exceeded the carrying amount of the respective goodwill 
in mid december we were apprised of unfavorable results of clinical data related to programs from our super critical fluids business unit located in bradford  england  nektar uk  which provided an indication that the fair value of the respective business units goodwill was below the carrying value 
therefore  in connection with our year end close process  we re performed the impairment analysis of goodwill and other long lived assets for nektar uk 
we determined the fair value of the intangibles and other assets of nektar uk based on a discounted cash flow model to be less than the carrying amount of goodwill and certain long lived assets 
based on management s assessment of the results of clinical data that became available in december  and results of the discounted cash flow valuation as of december   we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill and long lived assets in the year ended december  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill  on a consolidated basis  at december  and  is million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a test for recoverability of our intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized only if the carrying amount of an intangible or long lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
other than those long lived assets identified at nektar uk  to date  there have been no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of such assets in our other business units may not be recoverable  and therefore we have determined that there are no other impairments on our intangible and other long lived assets  including capitalized assets related to exubera 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles and long lived assets  we have concluded that there are no impairments in the carrying value of the remaining assets as of december  if this assessment changes in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the carrying value of our purchased intangibles as of december  and is million and million  respectively 
these assets are scheduled to be fully amortized by december the carrying value of our other long lived assets as of december  and is million and million  respectively 
judgments impacting fixed asset capitalization for exubera in accordance with sfas  accounting for research and development costs  we have expensed certain amounts paid for plant design  engineering  and validation costs for the automated assembly line equipment that will be used in connection with the manufacture of the inhaler device for exubera because such costs have no 
table of contents alternative future use 
the net credit of million recorded in the year ended december  was the result of million of expenses incurred  offset by a million credit received from our contract manufacturer 
the total amount expensed was million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   the capitalized net book value of the automated assembly line equipment located at our contract manufactures sites totals million 
these assets are intended to be used in connection with the manufacture of the inhaler device for exubera 
the total amount capitalized was nil  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these amounts have been capitalized based upon our determination that the related assets have alternative future use and therefore have separate economic or realizable value 
the depreciation expense related to these assets was million for the year ended december inventory reserves we perform quality control reviews of our raw materials and finished goods 
we record inventory reserves based upon specific identification of potentially defective raw material and finished goods batches 
in addition  we record an inspection reserve based on a historical estimate of finished goods that ultimately fail quality control 
we generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on obsolescence or risk of competition because the shelf life of our products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about demand or obsolescence were to change  additional inventory reserves may be needed  which could negatively impact our product gross margins 
our inventory reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this represented approximately and of gross inventory as of december  and  respectively 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
effective july   we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables on a prospective basis 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for uncollectible amounts 
we enter into collaborative research and development arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners that may involve multiple deliverables 
for multiple deliverable arrangements entered into after july  judgment is required in the areas of separability of units of accounting and the fair value of individual elements 
the principles and guidance outlined in eitf no 
provide a framework to a determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and b determine how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
our arrangements may contain the following elements collaborative research  milestones  manufacturing and supply  royalties and license fees 
for each separate unit of accounting we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value using available internal evidence for the undelivered item s and our arrangements generally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
in accordance with the guidance in eitf no 
 the company uses the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when it does not have fair value of a delivered item s 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
contract revenue from collaborative research and feasibility agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
advance payments for research and development revenue received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue from collaborative research and feasibility arrangements are recognized as the related costs are incurred 
amounts received under these arrangements are generally non refundable if the research effort is unsuccessful 

table of contents payments received for milestones achieved are deferred and recorded as revenue ratably over the next period of continued development 
management makes its best estimate of the period of time until the next milestone is reached 
this estimate affects the recognition of revenue for completion of the previous milestone 
the original estimate is periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimate to change and if so  amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively 
product sales are derived primarily from cost plus manufacturing and supply contracts for our peg reagents with individual customers in our industry 
sales terms for specific peg reagents are negotiated in advance 
revenues related to our product sales are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
no provisions for potential product returns have been made to date because we have not experienced any significant returns from our customers 
reclassification subsequent to the filing of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   additional clarification was provided regarding the financial statement classification of auction rate securities held as investments 
pursuant to this guidance  auction rate securities are not to be classified as cash and cash equivalents 
we invest in auction rate securities as part of our cash management strategy 
these investments  which we have historically classified as cash and cash equivalents because of the short time frame between auction periods  have been reclassified as short term investments 
we have reclassified million and million of auction rate securities from cash equivalents to short term investments as of december  and  respectively 
there was no impact on the consolidated statements of operations or total current assets as a result of the reclassification for the years ended december  or the impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows was an increase of million and million in cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this reclassification did not result in any change to our revenue  total current assets  or net loss for the years ended december  or  or for any quarterly period during the years ended december  or results of operations years ended december   and revenue in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs contract research revenue product sales and royalty revenue exubera commercialization readiness revenue   n a n a total revenue total revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents contract research revenue included reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and milestone payments received from our collaborative partners 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenue cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon the continuation of existing collaborations  signing of new collaborations  and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
contract research revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in contract research revenue of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to approximately million decrease in revenue from pfizer inc related to the transition of the exubera program from contract research and development to commercialization readiness 
the decrease in revenue from pfizer inc was partially offset by million increase of launch delay revenues recorded in in addition  during the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue from a one time payment related to aventis termination of a collaborative program with us 
other decreases were primarily due to the expected fluctuations in contract research revenue and the timing of milestone payments 
the increase of million or in contract research revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to an million increase in contract research revenue from pfizer inc related to the exubera collaboration and a million payment received from aventis behring related to the termination of their collaboration with us 
product and royalty revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product and royalty revenue accounted for of revenues for the year ended december   as compared to and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to million of royalty revenue received from eyetech  million of exubera product sales to pfizer inc  and million of product sales from aerogen 
these product and royalty revenue increases were partially offset by decreases of million of product sales from nektar advanced pegylation technology customers 
exubera commercialization readiness revenue represents reimbursement  by pfizer inc  of certain agreed upon operating costs relating to our exubera drug powder manufacturing facilities in preparation for commercial production  plus a markup on such costs 
such reimbursable revenue will not necessarily equal actual costs incurred and expensed as exubera commercialization readiness costs 
we do not anticipate receiving these revenues subsequent to the launch of exubera 
in the early phase of the exubera commercial launch in  we expect to receive a substantial amount of revenue from the manufacture and sale of the exubera inhalers and bulk powder insulin  both of which have lower gross margins than when combined with end product royalty revenue 
we do not expect to receive significant amounts of exubera royalty revenue until the latter half of fiscal year the decrease in product revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to lower demand  which resulted in lower sales of commercially approved products such as neulasta  somavert  and pegasys 
future product sales are dependent upon regulatory approval of new products for sale and adoption of current products in the market 
pfizer inc represented of our revenue for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  no other single customer represented or more of our total revenues for any of the three years ended december   or

gross margin from product sales were approximately in the year ended december   compared to gross margin from product sales of approximately in the year ended december   representing a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in product gross margin for the year ended december   compared to december   was primarily due to million of exubera sales to pfizer inc at zero margin and a decreased gross margin related to sales of nektar advanced pegylation products primarily due to decreased sales which resulted in lower overhead absorption 
in the early phase of the exubera commercial launch in  we expect to receive a substantial amount of revenue from the manufacture and sale of the exubera inhalers and bulk powder insulin  both of which have lower gross margins than when combined with end product royalty revenue 
we do not expect to receive significant amounts of exubera royalty revenue until the latter half of fiscal year exubera commercialization readiness costs are start up manufacturing costs we have incurred in our exubera drug powder manufacturing facility in preparation for commercial production for the year ended december  we do not anticipate incurring these costs subsequent to the launch of exubera 
the decrease in product gross margin for the year ended december   compared to december   was primarily due to a temporary shut down of part of the nektar advanced pegylation manufacturing operations in the year ended december   and an increase in our inventory reserves 
research and development in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs increase decrease vs increase decrease vs research development in process research and development   n a n a we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily attributable to increased spending relating to exubera as well as increased development spending for our proprietary product programs 

table of contents in the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million for in process research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of aerogen 
the in process research and development primarily represents two programs in clinical development  amikacin and surfactant 
we expect to continue investing in both of these programs over the next several years as part of our ongoing proprietary product development programs 
the amount of million was expensed on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use 
the value of purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between and using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 
this discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upwards for the risks associated with the project acquired 
the projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product  the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
we expect research and development spending to increase over the next few years as we continue to fund development of our technologies including our proprietary product development program 
while we believe our proprietary products strategy may result in improved economics for any products ultimately developed and approved  it will require us to invest significant funds in developing these products without reimbursement from a collaborative partner 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to annual salary increases  a one time expense of million associated with the buy out of our potential future royalty and milestone obligations with a partner  increased expenses related to validation testing of our exubera drug delivery device and outside services related to our proprietary programs

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease  less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease  less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  foreign currency risk our operations include research and development  manufacturing  and sales activities in the us and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have exposure 
our results of operations are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  most significantly the british pound 
to limit our economic exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to british pounds  we periodically purchase british pounds on the spot market and hold in a us bank account 
at december  and  we held british pounds valued at approximately million and million  respectively  in a us bank account  using the exchange rate as of period end 
this amount is included in cash on our balance sheet 
during the year ended december   an immaterial amount of losses resulting from revaluing british pounds at the current exchange rate were included in other income expense 
as part of our risk management strategy  we may decide to use derivative instruments  including forwards  foreign currency swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures  however  to date we have not entered into any such derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
a hypothetical increase in the us dollar relative to the british pound as of december  and  respectively  would have resulted in an additional million and million of foreign exchange loss on the british pounds held in our account in the us for the years ended december  and  respectively
