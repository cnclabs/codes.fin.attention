currently  the company does not experience significant seasonal trends in non rechargeable battery revenues and does not have enough sales history on the rechargeable batteries to determine if there is seasonality 
subsequent to the company s fourth quarter earnings release dated february   the company reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december  as a result  the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  has been adjusted accordingly  resulting in a decrease of in total assets and a corresponding decrease in total liabilities

total revenues of the company for the twelve months ended december  amounted to  a decrease of  or from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  non rechargeable battery sales declined  year over year 
within the non rechargeable segment  large cylindrical battery sales declined  primarily as a result of lower shipments of ba batteries  related to a transition of battery procurement responsibility within the military from the us department of the army communications and electronics command cecom to the defense logistics agency dla resulting in significantly fewer orders in offsetting the decline in ba shipments were higher sales of various other large cylindrical products  small cylindrical products and volt batteries 
rechargeable revenues rose  or  from  to  due to higher shipments of rechargeable battery packs and charger systems  offset in part by a decrease in shipments of the company s digital camera battery 
technology contract revenues decreased  or to  for the year ended december   mainly attributable to the timing of work of the company s development contract with general dynamics

excluding the impairment charge in  operating and other expenses increased  or  higher r d costs accounted for  of this increase  mainly due to additional resources committed to new product development 
in addition to the r d line shown in operating expenses  the company also considers its efforts in the technology contracts segment to be related to key battery development efforts 
operating and other expenses as a percentage of revenue rose to in compared with in  excluding the impairment charge  mainly due to the lower revenue base and the company s commitment to new product development 
as quarterly revenues from the military market have declined recently from high levels in the first half of  the company is committed to continuing to develop other areas of the business  particularly in commercial markets such as search and rescue  automotive telematics  and medical  where sales and development of new products are growing

the company continues to hold a equity interest in uti  although the company believes that uti has ceased its manufacturing operations 
the company does not believe the write off poses a risk to its current operations or future growth prospects because uti is no longer manufacturing product for the company  and the company has taken steps to establish alternate sources of supply 
miscellaneous income  primarily consisting of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  decreased to a loss of for the year ended december   from a gain of for the year ended december   mainly related to losses on foreign currency translations  resulting from the company s us dollar denominated intercompany loan arrangement with the company s uk subsidiary  as the dollar strengthened against the british pound sterling

the amount of the net deferred tax assets is considered realizable  however  such amount could be reduced or eliminated in the near term if actual or expected future us income or income tax rates are lower than estimated  or if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing taxable or deductible temporary differences
