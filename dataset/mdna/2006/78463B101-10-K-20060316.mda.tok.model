in the community bank and credit union market we provide on line personal and business banking applications as well as a telephone banking application in a robust single channel platform that offers an excellent balance between cost and feature set and performance for this highly competitive market 
in addition  in  we added mosaic s payments platform which provides software that operates atm networks and point of sale debit card transaction processing networks 
through a series of acquisitions  we have assembled a set of software solutions that address fundamentally all the customer facing transactions and activities of a bank 
these legacy products were written in different software programming languages 
in  we began combining the features  functions  business logic and data model for all the channels into one java jee platform with an open architecture designed to provide for inter operability and data sharing between various customer facing applications 
this suite of products is known as s s enterprise suite of products 
enterprise products are licensed on a module by module basis  for example internet personal banking or call center  and also can be implemented either in a single project or over a period of time as a full suite across all the customer facing applications of a bank 
we sell customer interaction software and services to financial services companies to help automate transactions over the internet  branch  call center  atm and point of sale devices 
we have multiple solution sets that address the needs of global  national  regional and community banks  credit unions  insurance companies  retailers and payment processors

additional information about our business  geographic disclosures and major customers is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
in  within our financial institutions business  we generated approximately of our revenues from services provided to our major customer  state farm mutual automobile insurance company 
revenue from state farm was approximately million and million in and  respectively  and is expected to be between million to million in the remainder of the revenue was generated from the sale of licenses  professional services  maintenance and hosting services in the global financial services market 

table of contents throughout and  we continued to invest in the development of the integrated s enterprise platform as the technology foundation for the s enterprise family of products 
the s enterprise platform includes the following applications retail internet banking  small business internet banking  corporate cash management  teller  sales and service  call center  voice banking and analytics 
these can be sold as stand alone applications or as an integrated suite of products 
in  we will focus on delivering quality solutions on the s enterprise platform 
we released our enterprise products from development in a managed introduction program mip in february the mip is designed to enable the entire organization to work with several customers in pre product and live production environments 
the mip is expected to continue throughout most of and will include all of the released applications 
additionally  we will invest in our next generation community banking solution which will include our packaged internet and voice banking solutions  and the payments engine of our postilion payments solution 
historically  we have not capitalized software development costs because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between technological feasibility and general customer release 
if the amount of time between the completion of beta testing and general customer release lengthens  we may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
excluding merger related costs and restructuring charges of million in and million in  our total operating expenses were million in  million in and million in in  we completed the process of restructuring the financial institutions business in which we reorganized our operating structure 
under the new structure  we are organized as business units designed around products and addressable markets 
we believe that the new structure will more effectively align the company with the needs of our customers 
in total  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide and closed or consolidated several office facilities 
we continue to look for additional ways to streamline our global operations and continue to use a disciplined approach to control costs throughout our organization 
business acquisitions in the third quarter of  we purchased substantially all of the assets of providus software solutions  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of zions bancorporation that offered risk management and regulatory compliance products 
we paid cash consideration of million  including approximately  in acquisition costs  upon the closing of the transaction and agreed to pay additional consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets through we believe this acquisition will add to our suite of compliance products 
any additional consideration will be accounted for as additional purchase price and will increase the goodwill amount associated with the providus acquisition in the period in which such payment becomes issued or issuable 
zions continues to be a customer of s for both risk and compliance products as well as retail banking products 
the acquisition was accounted for separately from the existing relationship with zions 
the acquired providus business is part of our risk and compliance segment 
business acquisitions in the fourth quarter of  we acquired mosaic software holdings  limited  a united kingdom based provider of solutions that drive atms and electronic payment networks 
this acquisition added a leading financial transaction solution to s s suite of products and enables us to offer financial services providers an atm channel solution along with the our front office suite to large  community and regional financial institutions 
we paid cash consideration of million upon the closing of the transaction 
in  we recorded an additional million related to the earn out payment under the purchase agreement 
additionally  we intend to place million into escrow which may be paid upon resolution of a contingency which may not be known until the second quarter of in the third quarter of  we acquired x net associates  inc  a rochester  new york based provider of lending solutions 
we believe this acquisition will strengthen our product offering around lending solutions and accelerate the development of additional lending functionality 
in september  we announced general availability of our s lending solutions product 
we paid cash consideration of million for this business 
under the agreement  additional consideration could be paid to one shareholder of x net  who is also an s employee  if certain financial metrics are achieved 
there was a maximum of million that could be earned in the period from august  through july  and million that could be earned in the period from august  through july  in the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement with the shareholder of x net to settle the earn out as of december  we recorded million of contingent consideration as compensation expense in the year ended december  additionally  we agreed to pay an additional million in august and upon the completion of certain goals 
this payment will be accrued as compensation expense over the period in which it is earned 

table of contents in the second quarter of  we purchased a business unit from vmoksha technologies  private limited in order to establish a wholly owned software development center in pune  india 
previously  this business unit provided software development  programming and other related services for s we believe this acquisition will reduce our costs and provide greater flexibility and control over the quality of the development and professional services efforts from this center 
we paid cash consideration of approximately million for the business unit 
revenue from significant customers revenues from state farm were  and of our financial institution revenues and  and of our revenues from continuing operations during the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues from state farm for the year ended december  decreased approximately million from we expect state farm to contribute approximately to of our financial institution segment revenue for zurich insurance company accounted for of our revenues from our financial institutions segment and of our total revenues during the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we did not have any revenues from zurich 
restructuring charges and merger related costs in  we reorganized our worldwide operations by reducing the work force  relocating and consolidating certain office facilities and selling certain corporate assets 
in connection with these activities  we recorded restructuring charges and merger related costs of million during the year ended december  in total  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide and closed or consolidated office facilities 
in the domestic operations of our financial institution segment  we recorded million in restructuring charges during the year ended december   which were primarily comprised of charges for severance costs associated with headcount reductions  lease payments associated with excess office space and other corporate charges 
in  we consolidated our uk data center operations into our global hosting center in atlanta  relocated our remaining uk operations to a smaller facility  decreased our workforce both in our european and apj operations and closed offices in our apj operations 
as a result  in  we recorded restructuring charges of million in our european operations and million in our apj operations 
these charges were comprised of accelerated depreciation of assets  severance costs  other related costs to relocate the data center operations  losses on the vacated office space and the write off of abandoned leasehold improvements 
we undertook these restructuring activities in to streamline our worldwide operations following a period of multiple business acquisitions  and to reduce our operating expenses to a level that we believe is appropriate based on our estimate of future revenues 
we achieved cost savings from these activities throughout the geographic and functional areas of our operating segments 
in  we decreased our merger related reserve for legal claims by million  which was established in connection with our acquisition of fics group  nv in november we were able to resolve two legal matters during for less than previously estimated 
in the second quarter of  we reduced our merger related accrual by million when we determined that we had an alternate use for excess office space that was reserved when we completed the acquisition of point in march in october  we announced changes to our organization that will reduce operating costs and more effectively align our company with the needs of our customers 
the estimated gross annual savings rendered by these actions totaled approximately million by the end of  however  are partially off set by increases in some operating costs in our data center and the community and regional banking group so that the net annual savings will be closer to million 
the expense reduction results from an approximate reduction in employee headcount as well as consolidation of some facilities 
in connection with this reorganization  we recorded million in restructuring costs in  primarily comprised of charges for severance costs associated with headcount reductions  lease payments associated with excess office space and the write off of fixed assets 
the expense reductions primarily are related to our domestic and international core financial institutions services solutions teams 
for all restructuring plans  we expect to make future cash expenditures  net of anticipated sublease income  related to these restructuring activities of approximately million  of which we anticipate to pay approximately million within the next twelve months 
adjustments to the restructuring accrual may be recorded in the future due to changes in estimates of lease termination reserves arising from changing real estate market conditions 
for additional information about these restructuring activities  including a tabular presentation of our restructuring charges  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 

table of contents merger related costs in  we decreased our merger related reserve for legal claims by million  which was established in connection with our acquisition of fics group  nv in november we were able to resolve two legal matters during for less than previously estimated 
additionally in  we reduced our merger related accrual by million when we determined that we had an alternate use for excess office space that was reserved when we completed the acquisition of point in march critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
generally  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under other assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition  estimation of our allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments  valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  valuation of acquired businesses  determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs  determination of the fair value of employee stock options  recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities  reserve for contingencies  and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is a key metric used by management  securities analysts and investors to evaluate our performance 
our revenue arrangements generally include multiple elements such as license fees for software products  installation services  customization services  training services  post contract customer support  data center services and  in some cases  hardware or other third party products 
software license revenue 
we recognize software license sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
for software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software provided there is evidence of an arrangement  collection of our fee is reasonably assured and the fee is fixed or determinable 
in certain of these arrangements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element and exists for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method under sop no 
when the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we record revenue for the license and professional services over the implementation period using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
for software licenses where the license term does not begin until installation is complete  we recognize license and professional services revenue when we complete the installation of the software 
for subscription license arrangements where we sell customers the rights to unspecified products as well as unspecified upgrades and enhancements during a specified term  the license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
for license arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the license revenue is generally recognized as payments become due 

table of contents support and maintenance revenue 
revenues for post contract customer support and maintenance are recognized ratably over the contract period 
professional services revenue 
revenues derived from arrangements to provide professional services on a time and materials basis are recognized as the related services are performed 
for other revenues from professional services that are provided on a fixed fee basis  revenues are recognized pursuant to sab on a proportional performance method based upon labor hours incurred as a percentage of total estimated labor hours to complete the project 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
data center revenue 
we recognize data center revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we also consider the applicability of emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our data center arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if it is determined that a software element covered by sop no 
is present in a hosting arrangement  the license  professional services and data center revenue is recognized pursuant to sop no 
if it is determined that a software element covered by sop no 
is not present in a hosting arrangement  we recognize revenue for the arrangement pursuant to sab no 
and eitf see a full discussion of our revenue recognition policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our contractual arrangements are evaluated on a contract by contract basis and often require our judgment and estimates that affect the classification and timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our products and services are fixed or determinable  whether or not collection of our fees is reasonably assured  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software product  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our products and services 
additionally  we may be required to make the following estimates percentage of labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours for each contract  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  and the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts or billing adjustments 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
for instance  many of our revenue arrangements are accounted for using the percentage of completion method since the services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
if it was determined that those services were not essential to the functionality of the software  we may have recognized the license revenue upon delivery of the license  provided other required criteria were satisfied 
further  if we determined that we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  we would defer all revenue and recognize it upon completion of the contract 
estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments 
we are required to report accounts receivable at the amount we expect to collect from our customers 
as a result  we are required to use our judgment to estimate the likelihood that certain receivables may not be collected or that we might offer future discounts or concessions for previously billed amounts 
as a result  we have established a discount allowance for estimated billing adjustments and a bad debt allowance for estimated amounts that we will not collect 
we report provisions for billing adjustments as a reduction of revenue and provisions for bad debts as a component of selling expense 
we review specific accounts for collectibility based on circumstances known to us at the date of our financial statements 
in addition  we maintain reserves based on historical billing adjustments and write offs 
these estimates are based on historical discounts  concessions and bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
accordingly  our judgments and estimates about the collectibility of our accounts receivable affect revenue  selling expense and the carrying value of our accounts receivable 

table of contents valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets 
if such evaluation indicates a potential impairment  we use discounted cash flows to measure fair value in determining the amount of the long lived assets that should be written off 
for long term cost and equity investments  we write down their carrying values if it is determined that an impairment is other than temporary 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations  the timing and amount of the charges may have been significantly different 
at december   the carrying value of these investments was million 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which we adopted on january   requires us to perform an annual test of goodwill value to determine whether or not it has been impaired 
based on the results of our initial and annual tests  except as explained in the following paragraph  the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their carrying value 
while we no longer record amortization expense for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in any given period 
valuation of acquired businesses 
we made three acquisitions in and one acquisition in we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at date of acquisition 
prior to this allocation  we are required to identify intangible assets and assign a value to these intangible assets based on their fair value 
determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets requires management to estimate future cash flows for the related assets and the useful life of such assets 
the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
consequently  our estimates determine the timing and the amount of expense recognized in our financial statements 
determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs 
we are required to assess when technological feasibility occurs for products that we develop 
based on our judgment  we have determined that technological feasibility for our products generally occurs when we complete beta testing 
because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between completion of beta testing and general customer release  we have not capitalized any software development costs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if we determined that technological feasibility had occurred at an earlier point in the development cycle and that subsequent production costs incurred before general availability of the product were significant  we would have capitalized those costs and recognized them over future periods 
we continue to monitor changes in the software development cycle and may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
determination of the fair value of employee stock options 
we are required to determine the fair value of stock options when they are granted to our employees 
historically  the pro forma expense was presented in a footnote 
however  beginning january   this expense will be recorded in our statement of operations 
in determining the fair value  management makes certain estimates related primarily to the expected life of the option and the volatility of our stock 
these assumptions affect the estimated fair value of the option 
as such  these estimates will affect the compensation expense we record in future periods 
recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities 
during the last three years  we recorded charges in connection with various restructuring activities 
see further discussion of the terms of these charges in note to the consolidated financial statements 
following the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we establish a liability for the estimated fair value of exit costs at the date we incur a liability under an approved restructuring plan 
at that time  and thereafter until the plan activities are complete  the actual costs or timing of payments associated with the plan may differ from our estimates 
we use our judgment and information available to us at the date of the financial statements to reevaluate our initial estimates of the exit costs 
if we believe that our previous estimates of exit costs or timing of payments are 
table of contents no longer accurate in light of current conditions  we adjust the liability with a corresponding increase or decrease to current period earnings 
any adjustments to estimates of our exit costs under restructuring plans are reflected on the same line item in the statement of operations as the initial charge to establish the restructuring liability 
additionally  in periods subsequent to the initial measurement  we increase the carrying amount of the liability by the amount of accretion recorded as an expense due to the passage of time 
accrued restructuring costs at december  reflect our estimate of the fair value of future rental obligations and other costs associated with office space that we do not plan to use in our operations as a result of the restructuring plans  offset by our estimate of the fair value of sublease income for this space 
the determination of fair value is based on a discounted future cash flow model using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
while we know the terms of our contractual lease obligations and related future commitments  we must estimate when and under what terms we will be able to sublet the office space  if at all 
such estimates require a substantial amount of judgment  especially given current real estate market conditions 
actual sublease terms may differ substantially from our estimates 
any future changes in our estimates of lease termination reserves could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses  we established reserves for certain contingencies that existed at the date of acquisition 
at that time  we believed that the resolution of the contingency would result in future cash expenditures that we estimated based on the information available at the date of acquisition 
as those contingencies are resolved  we reduce the related liabilities for any related cash disbursements or if we determine that the contingency is no longer likely to result in a loss 
reserve for contingencies 
when a loss contingency exists  we are required to evaluate the likelihood that a future event or events will confirm the loss 
sfas no 
accounting for contingencies states that a company must accrue for a loss contingency by a charge to income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on most of our deferred tax assets 
in order to release the valuation allowance we must show a history of sustained profitability 
at such time we will make a determination to reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance related to domestic net operating loss carryforwards based on estimates at such time regarding our future earnings and the recoverability of the domestic net operating loss carryforwards 
a portion of any such reversal could have a positive impact on our income tax benefit and our earnings in the period in which it is reversed 
it is unlikely that we will reverse any of this valuation allowance before recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their grant date fair values over the corresponding service period and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the staff s interpretation of sfas r 
this interpretation provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas r and investor and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided 
we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab in connection with the adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error correction a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
statement also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new 
table of contents standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
the following table sets forth selected revenue data for the years ended december  and software support and professional licenses maintenance services data center other total year ended december  financial institutions risk and compliance total year ended december  financial institutions risk and compliance total total revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
our financial institutions segment earned revenues of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in our risk and compliance business earned revenues of million in  an increase of million  or  over revenues of million 
the overall decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to a decline in revenues in our financial institutions segment  offset in part by the revenues acquired with the mosaic business and increases in revenues in our risk and compliance business 
the decline in revenues from our financial institutions business during is primarily due to sales execution issues 
sales execution was impacted both in the united states and international by the delay in release of the new enterprise product as well as the distraction associated with the change in management and the resulting reorganization 
these declines were partially offset by the revenues earned for the full year from the acquired mosaic business 
software license revenues for our financial institutions segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the same period in the overall decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to a decrease in our financial institutions business and lower international sales  offset in part by the revenues earned by the acquired mosaic with the business 
software license revenues for our financial institutions business are lower due to the delay in delivery of the next version of our s enterprise products and the effect of the transition to a subscription based licensing model 
in  we are licensing a number of products primarily on a subscription basis  including enterprise applications  lending  and our suite of community and regional banking products 
subscription license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract which is typically between and months whereas perpetual license revenue is generally recognized upon execution of the contract and delivery of the product or on a percentage of completion basis over the installation  or service  period 
these subscription  or term  licenses combine the right to use the licensed software and the right to receive support and maintenance and unspecified enhancements into one periodic fee and typically do not transfer the right to use at the end of its initial term 
during  we expect to continue to recognize perpetual license revenue through sales of our legacy products  including add on sales to customers with existing perpetual licenses  as well as through our reseller channels 
as the ratio of subscription licenses sold increases  the amount of license revenue for any given period could decrease which could also decrease earnings 
we believe the long term benefits of recurring subscription revenue outweigh any temporary impact on license revenue and earnings 
software license revenue of million for our risk and compliance business increased million from the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to revenues from new license sales  significant upgrades to several customers  early termination fees of million paid by one customer who canceled its license contract and revenues earned by the acquired providus business 
support and maintenance revenues for our financial institutions segment were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to support and maintenance fees acquired with the mosaic business  offset in part by a decrease in support and maintenance fees earned from our international businesses 
we believe that support and maintenance revenues from our financial institutions segment will grow sequentially each quarter in the short term 
however  as subscription licenses include the right to receive 
table of contents support and maintenance  growth in subscription licenses will tend to diminish support and maintenance revenues over time as these fees will be included in license revenues 
support and maintenance revenues for the risk and compliance business were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the same period in support and maintenance fees increased primarily due to customers who purchased licenses during and professional services revenues for our financial institutions segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million the same period in this decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in professional services revenues from our largest customer and the completion of several large projects  offset in part by service revenues from the acquired mosaic business 
additionally  professional services revenues are impacted by lower license sales as license sales generally include professional services for implementation 
services revenue in any one quarter can be impacted by one or two large customer projects and therefore can increase or decrease based on the timing of projects 
the risk and compliance business recorded million for professional services revenues during the year ended december   which compares to million for the same period in data center revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million the same period in the increase resulted from increases in the number of hosted customers 
as we add hosted customers on our products and our existing customer base grows  we expect data center revenues to increase on a sequential quarter basis throughout other revenues are primarily related to the sale of third party hardware and software that is used in connection with our products 
other revenue fluctuates based on the mix of products and services sold and is not typical in our sales arrangements 
the related cost of the hardware sold is included in cost of other revenue as the hardware is delivered 
there is only minimal gross margin associated with other revenue 
direct costs 
direct costs increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  direct costs  excluding depreciation  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
direct costs exclude charges for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
cost of software licenses for our products sold includes the cost of software components that we license from third parties as well as the amortization of purchased technology 
in general  the cost of software licenses for our financial institution segment is minimal because we internally develop most of the software components  the cost of which is reflected in product development expense as it is incurred 
the cost of software licenses could increase in future periods as we license and install more of our new s enterprise products 
these products include software components that we license from third parties 
however  cost of software licenses will continue to vary with the mix of products sold 
costs of professional services  support and maintenance consist primarily of personnel and related infrastructure costs 
direct costs associated with professional services  support and maintenance were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the same period in this increase was attributable to the professional services  support and maintenance costs associated with the acquired mosaic business which was not included in the first ten months of additionally in  we reduced loss accruals related to contracts accounted for using percentage of completion accounting 
these loss accruals were accrued during and reflected amounts by which our anticipated future costs would exceed the remaining unrecognized contractual revenues for those projects 
costs of data center consist of personnel costs  facility costs and related infrastructure costs to support our data center business 
direct data center costs increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in as a percentage of data center revenues  data center costs excluding depreciation were and for the years ended december  and  respectively

if cash generated from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or issue debt securities or establish an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the addition of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the foreign currency financial statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenues and expenses  which are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of our international operations to us dollars in consolidation 
generally  our expenses are denominated in the same currency as our revenues and the exposure to rate changes is minimal 
we utilize financial instruments to manage the risks of certain identifiable transactions and achieve a more predictable cash flow related to our foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we record financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
we estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
changes in financial instruments fair value are recognized in earnings unless the instrument qualifies as a hedge under sfas no 
and meets specific hedge accounting criteria 
qualifying financial instruments gains and losses are deferred in accumulated comprehensive income for cash flow hedges until the time to offset the hedged item 
the net assets of our foreign operations at december  were approximately million 
our capital lease obligations include only fixed rates of interest 
therefore  we do not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates relating to our capital lease obligations
