item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture and sell rubber tracked  all season vehicles and related accessories and attachments 
we also manufacture rubber tracked undercarriages  which are a primary component on caterpillar s mtls 
our products are able to traverse nearly any terrain with minimal damage to the ground  making them useful in industries such as construction  landscaping and agriculture 
we distribute our products through an independent dealer network in the united states  canada  australia and new zealand 
the undercarriages sold to caterpillar are incorporated by caterpillar in its mtl products and sold exclusively through the caterpillar dealer network  primarily in north america 
we experienced a significant increase in sales for the year ended december  due to several reasons as explained below we believe there is a greater acceptance of rubber track machines in the marketplace as users experience the benefits that a rubber track machine can provide over a standard wheeled machine 
the number of companies entering into the rubber track machine market has increased in the last few years  thereby contributing to the increased awareness and market acceptance of the products 
we have increased our number of product offerings over the past few years thereby making it easier to attract prospective dealers to carry our posi track product line 
in addition  the number of dealers selling our posi track product line has increased over the past few years 
the current low interest rate environment has provided for easier financing by end users 
our results of operations for the year ended december  include sales of million from loegering  compared with million for the three months ended december  on october   we closed on our acquisition of loegering in a merger transaction 
we believe our sales were benefited in by approximately million of sales to customers in areas of the united states affected by hurricanes katrina and rita 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and warranty obligations 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have determined that the time of shipment is the most appropriate point to recognize revenue as the risk of loss passes to the customer when placed with a carrier for delivery ie  upon shipment 
any post sale obligations on our part  consisting primarily of warranty obligations  are estimated and accrued for at the time of shipment 
we obtain verbal or written purchase authorizations from customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
adjustments to slow moving and obsolete inventories to the lower of cost or market are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we do not believe our inventories are subject to rapid obsolescence 
we evaluate the adequacy of the inventories carrying value quarterly 
warranties 
we provide limited warranties to purchasers of our products which vary by product 
the warranties generally cover defects in materials and workmanship for one year from the delivery date to the first end user 
the rubber tracks used on our products carry a pro rated warranty up to  hours of usage 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
income taxes 
we record income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation 
we account for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as opposed to the fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pursuant to the provisions of apb  we do not record an expense for the value of stock based awards granted to employees 
the fasb issued an amendment to sfas no 
 share based payment  sfas no 
r  which is effective for public companies for periods beginning after december  we are required to implement the proposed standard no later than the quarter that begins january  sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we anticipate the effect of adopting this statement will reduce our diluted earnings per share by approximately 
for the year ended december  
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development operating income net earnings the following table sets forth product sales data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  r series products oem undercarriages parts and other loegering net sales 
for the year ended december   net sales increased to million  compared with million for this increase was primarily the result of four factors 
first  sales of our posi track products increased due to a greater number of posi track dealers in  the addition of one new model  the rcv  which went into production in the second quarter of  and additional sales to the hurricane stricken areas in the united states 
the number of posi track dealers increased in  with the majority of dealers added in north america 
second  sales from loegering  acquired in october  totaled million for  compared to million for the three month period in third  sales of our undercarriages to caterpillar for use on its mtl product line increased for compared with due to greater demand for the mtl products 
finally  sales of service parts and other items increased in compared to due primarily to the increased population of machines and undercarriages in service that consume service parts 
we anticipate our net sales for will be in the range of million based on our current and projected level of orders for our posi track products and undercarriages and projected future service parts demand 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared with million for this increase was primarily the result of four factors 
first  sales of our posi track products increased in  due to the addition of two new models in january  a greater number of posi track dealers in and a full year of sales of the rc in  which was introduced in the first quarter of second  sales of mtl undercarriages increased in  due to three models of undercarriages being sold for the first nine months of and increased market demand 
in  one undercarriage model was added during the first quarter and  as such  had sales for only a portion of third  sales of service parts more than doubled in due to a greater number of machines and undercarriages in service 
finally  net sales included million of sales from loegering  which was acquired in october gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  compared with million for  and the gross profit percentage increased from in to in the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increased sales we experienced during as discussed above 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due to several offsetting factors 
first  we believe the list price increase that was put in place for all posi track machines ordered after february  contributed to the increase in gross profit percentage for second  we believe our gross profit percentage increased from a change in the sales mix for we experienced a greater concentration of sales of higher priced machines  primarily the rcv and the rc  in as compared to in addition  more of these machines were sold with additional accessories  such as cabs and air conditioning  in as compared to both of these factors increased our gross profit percentage  as these machines and accessories carry a greater than average gross profit percentage 
also contributing to the increase in was the increase in the sale of service parts  which generally carry a higher gross profit percentage than machines 
in addition  the inclusion of loegering s sales for the entire fiscal year helped increase the overall gross profit percentage as loegering s products carry a higher gross profit percentage  on average  when compared with our products 
third  we 
table of contents believe operational efficiencies obtained from higher production volumes helped increase the gross profit percentage in offsetting these increases were planned decreases in the selling price and ultimately the gross profit percentage of undercarriages to caterpillar on january  for two of the three undercarriage models sold to caterpillar and service parts as of november  finally  gross profit percentage was also negatively affected by steel surcharges of million in  compared with million in due to the price changes contained in the supply agreement with caterpillar and based on the anticipated sales mix for  we anticipate our gross profit percentage for will be in the range of for the year ended december   gross profit increased to million  compared with million for  and the gross profit percentage increased from in to in the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increased sales experienced during as discussed above 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to a shift in the mix of products sold in as we had increased sales of posi track products in over posi track products generally carry a higher gross profit percentage than mtl undercarriages 
we also believe our raw material unit cost reduction project initiated in the first quarter of as well as operational efficiencies obtained from higher production volumes helped increase the gross profit percentage in offsetting these increases were steel surcharges of approximately million in we experienced no steel surcharges in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of loegering  which does not yet experience the same degree of leverage as we do 
loegering s selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million for  compared with  for the three months loegering s operations were included with ours for in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to increase sales commissions from the increased sales of our posi track products of approximately million  increased advertising and promotion costs to promote the technology benefits of our products of approximately  and the overall increase in the volume of our business 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses was due primarily to increased advertising and promotion to promote the technology benefits of our products  increased sales commissions from increased sales of our posi track products  costs related to the acquisition of loegering  initial compliance costs related to sarbanes oxley implementation and the overall increase in the volume of our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was due to the on going development of new products namely the sr and sr and additional applications of our track technology such as undercarriages for the vermeer machines 
we also developed a smaller version of the loegering vts product  which went into production in the third quarter of we anticipate our future spending on research and development activities will focus on additional product offerings and additional applications of our track technology and will be approximately of net sales in for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million  compared with  for the increase was due primarily to the on going development of new products  including the rcv  which was introduced in january other income expense 
other income expense was million for the year ended december   compared with  for this increase was due primarily to greater funds available for investment and increased short term interest rates in funds increased in due to proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and net earnings generated in and in addition  loegering sold the intellectual property and the tangible personal property related to its snowblower product line to caterpillar in for  resulting in a gain of for the year ended december   other income was  compared with  for this increase was due primarily to increased interest income from greater funds available for investment in funds increased in due to proceeds received from the sale of common stock to caterpillar in january  proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and net earnings generated in and 
table of contents net earnings 
net earnings were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of increased sales with an increased gross profit percentage and increased non operating income  offset in part by increased operating expenses and a higher effective income tax rate 
we anticipate our diluted earnings per share for  before the effect of adopting sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  will be in the range of based on our anticipated sales  gross profit and expense levels for the impact on diluted earnings per share for the expensing of stock options and other compensation expenses related to this adoption is anticipated to be 
per share for for the year ended december   net earnings were million  compared with million for the increase was primarily a result of increased sales with an increased gross profit percentage  offset in part by increased operating expenses 
we also realized a slightly lower effective income tax rate in due to increased international sales and increased tax credits from increased research and development expenditures in liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   we generated million of cash and cash equivalents compared with generating  of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  during  we generated million of cash from operations  as increased profitability and increased payables were offset primarily by increased accounts receivables from increased sales and increased raw materials to facilitate expected future production levels and parts sales 
we used million of cash in investing activities during  as we invested million to purchase property and equipment  the majority of which is integral to the manufacturing of certain inventory components 
we also purchased million of short term and long term investments in this cash use was partially offset by the redemption of certain short term investments 
in  we chose to eliminate the use of auction rate securities from our investment portfolio  which were classified as short term investments  and replaced them with short term tax exempt investments  which are classified as cash equivalents 
financing activities generated  of cash from the exercise of stock options by employees and directors  offset by payments made on long term liabilities in in december  we exercised our purchase option on the capital lease for our grand rapids manufacturing facility with a payment of million from available cash 
table of contractual commitments the following table represents our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period s omitted contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations financing guarantee total purchase obligations represent the total value of all open purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products as of december  our financing guarantee is described in note j to the financial statements filed in connection with this annual report on form k 
caterpillar revenue recognition gross profit through october   we sold our undercarriages and service parts to caterpillar under the terms of the alliance agreement 
the alliance agreement has been replaced  effective november   with a supply agreement as described below 
through october   we recognized as sales our cost for the mtl undercarriages  as defined in the alliance agreement between us and caterpillar  plus a portion of the anticipated gross profit that caterpillar expected to recognize upon sale of the mtls to caterpillar dealers  when we shipped undercarriages to caterpillar 
the gross profit percentage that we received for two of the three undercarriages sold to caterpillar was reduced by on january  
table of contents the gross profit percentage for the third undercarriage sold to caterpillar was scheduled to be reduced by effective january   had the alliance agreement been extended into caterpillar supply agreement on september  we signed a five year supply agreement with caterpillar  effective november  the supply agreement replaces the alliance agreement  which expired october  the key terms of the supply agreement are as follows scope consistent with the original alliance agreement  caterpillar will purchase from us of its undercarriage requirements for current and specified future caterpillar mtls  as defined 
if caterpillar chooses to manufacture mtls outside north america for non north american markets  caterpillar will purchase from us of its undercarriage requirements for these mtls  provided we meet the capacity requirements and the local requirements  as defined  for the applicable geographic area 
should we choose not to supply undercarriages to caterpillar for these non north american sales  we would grant a royalty bearing license to caterpillar to use our intellectual property to manufacture undercarriages for use on mtls manufactured outside north america for the non north american markets 
caterpillar will continue to purchase of its requirements for proprietary original equipment manufacturer aftermarket service parts from us 
we will continue to be allowed to sell our rubber track undercarriages to other equipment manufacturers for machines that do not compete with caterpillar s multi terrain loaders 
we will continue to utilize caterpillar components in the manufacture of our products 
pricing there was no change to the current mtl undercarriage pricing through december  starting in  we expect to earn gross profit percentages on the sale of our undercarriages similar to those expected  had the original alliance agreement with caterpillar been extended to with the expected increased volume of service parts  we have agreed to accept a lower gross margin on the sale of those service parts  effective november  we anticipate the impact of the new supply agreement may reduce our overall gross profit percentage for between zero and two percentage points 
term the supply agreement will commence on november  and will continue through november  the supply agreement will automatically renew for successive one year renewal terms unless either party provides at least six months prior written notice of termination 
along with the new supply agreement  caterpillar entered into a registration rights agreement with us that provides caterpillar registration rights for unregistered shares of our common stock it currently holds 
however  so long as the supply agreement remains in effect  caterpillar has agreed not to sell or dispose of any of its asv shares prior to january  vermeer commercial alliance agreement on september   we entered into the vermeer agreement with vermeer 
under the vermeer agreement  we will be the exclusive supplier of rubber track undercarriages and service parts to vermeer for use on select products in vermeer s line of horizontal directional drills  utility trenchers and other products 
the term of the vermeer agreement is eight years  with automatic one year renewal periods unless either party gives the other party at least six months written notice of termination
