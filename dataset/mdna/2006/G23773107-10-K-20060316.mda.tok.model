item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce and where the use of reverse osmosis ro technology to produce potable water is economically feasible 
we intend to increase revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas and in new areas 
we expect to maintain operating efficiencies by continuing to focus on our successful business model and by properly executing our equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs 
we also believe that many caribbean basin and adjacent countries  being water scarce  present opportunities for operation of our plants in favorable regulatory environments 
our operations and activities are conducted at eleven plants in five countries the cayman islands  belize  barbados  the british virgin islands and the bahamas and in three business segments retail  bulk and services 
comparative operations location plants capacity location plants capacity cayman islands cayman islands bahamas bahamas belize belize barbados barbados british virgin islands british virgin islands total total million us gallons per day 
prior to our acquisitions in  we operated plants with a capacity of million us gallons per day 
cayman islands we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using ro technology to convert seawater to potable water since there is a limited natural supply of fresh water on the cayman islands 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman 
our operations consist of six reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants which provide water to approximately  retail residential and commercial customers within a government licensed area and bulk water sales to the water authority cayman 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride pipe 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our retail water customers and million us gallons million us gallons to our bulk customers in grand cayman 

table of contents belize our belize operation  which was acquired on july   consists of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant on ambergris caye  belize  central america capable of producing  us gallons per day 
we sell water to one customer  belize water services limited  which then distributes the water through its own distribution system to residential  commercial and tourist properties on ambergris caye 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer in belize 
bahamas our bimini plant is capable of producing  us gallons per day and provides potable water to bimini sands resort and to the bimini beach hotel 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our retail water customer in bimini  bahamas 
as a result of our acquisition of waterfields company limited in august  we acquired an additional reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in the bahamas 
waterfields produces potable water from one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in new providence and has a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
waterfields company limited provides water from one plant  the windsor plant  on the island of new providence on a take or pay basis to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas under a long term build  own and operate supply agreement 
in october  we expanded the capacity of this plant by million us gallons per day 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer 
barbados the barbados operation consists of a service agreement to operate one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant with a capacity of million us gallons per day  which is owned by sandy lane resort 
this plant is operated by desalco barbados ltd  the wholly owned subsidiary of desalco limited 
the plant provides water to the sandy lane resort and during we produced approximately million us gallons million us gallons 
british virgin islands we are in the market in the british virgin islands with an equity position and shared management control of ocean conversion bvi ltd  which produces potable water from two reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in tortola

during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of 
table of contents assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to trade accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
our company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimatable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates the possible impairment of goodwill 
management identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the company is required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  the company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
our annual tests resulted in no goodwill impairment 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation commences in the month the asset is placed in service and is calculated using a straight line method with an allowance for estimated residual value 
rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings to years plant and equipment to years distribution system to years office furniture  fixtures and equipment to years vehicles to years leasehold improvements lesser of years or operating lease term lab equipment to years additions to property  plant and equipment are comprised of the cost of the contracted services  direct labor and materials 
assets under construction are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment upon completion of a project 
improvements that significantly increase the value of property  plant and equipment are capitalized 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements are charged to expense as incurred 

table of contents construction in progress the cost of borrowed funds directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets  which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be ready for their intended use  are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for use or sale 
trade accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
management continuously evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances based on estimates of the level of actual write offs that might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information 
for the year ended december  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total revenue gross profit net income diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total revenue gross profit net income diluted earnings per share results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in revenue from retail increased from  to  in when compared to this variation primarily reflected increased demand by residential customers in grand cayman  particularly in the west bay service area  which experienced a increase in volume sales 
we believe many residents relocated to west bay in the wake of hurricane ivan s damage in late 
table of contents efforts to rebuild damaged tourist properties are continuing at a rapid pace but one hotel and a number of condominiums within our cayman market have not yet fully reopened and new construction projects experienced problems due to storm threats  labor shortages and delayed material deliveries 
commercial sales were down in versus until tourism returns to the pre hurricane levels in the cayman market  revenues from commercial customers within our retail segment may continue to be flat or lower in the future 
revenue from bulk increased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily the twofold result of additional consumption by our customer water authority cayman in the cayman islands and to a lesser extent increased consumption by our customer in belize 
in addition  although we did experience higher revenue related to the recovery of energy costs at our windsor plant in the bahamas  this was more than offset by pricing adjustments of approximately  in and  in related to reduced deliveries associated with the fouling of ro membrane elements throughout and we are in the process of remediating this problem through various cleaning procedures and equipment modifications  and have placed six containerized desalination units on the windsor site which are being used to supply water under our new blue hills contract and to supplement water production capacity at windsor 
revenue from services services increased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to additional engineering fees charged to our affiliate  ocean conversion bvi ltd  for work on the new water plant in tortola  british virgin islands 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in cost of retail sales increased from  to  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to additional variable costs associated with the increase in sales 
cost of bulk sales increased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the increase in cost of sales is disproportionately higher than the corresponding increase in revenues due to the additional operating costs related to fouling of ro membrane elements and higher energy costs at our windsor plant in the bahamas 
cost of sales from services increased by  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to additional non capitalized payroll expense and employee recruiting fees associated with the general expansion of our business 
gross profit the gross profit margin decreased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  for the reasons explained above 

table of contents general and administrative expense total general and administrative expense g a increased by  from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in g a was and of total revenue for the respective years ended december  and retail g a increased by  from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to i an additional  in unanticipated audit  accounting and legal fees involving the sarbanes oxley internal control review and certification process  ii increase in the number of director s meetings held during the year  iii increased legal fees associated with our enhanced level of contract bidding  contract awards and financing initiatives and iv a general increase in expenses to support our higher level of activity 
our policy is and has been to allocate all non direct corporate g a to retail 
bulk g a decreased  from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in services g a increased  to  for the year 
other income expense total other income increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in although interest expense increased  due to rising libor rates  this was more than offset by an increase in both profit sharing and equity income from the investment in ocbvi  which has benefited from higher sales since the customer made significant repairs to their distribution system 
net income net income decreased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the prior year  however  included a one time gain of  attributable to an insurance recovery with respect to hurricane ivan 
the decrease in net income  after taking this gain into effect  was from the prior year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in revenue from our retail water retail operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due to higher water sales in our primary market in the cayman islands  as a result of an increased demand in both our tourist volume and residential developments before hurricane ivan affected the cayman islands in mid september published tourist air arrival records thru august indicate a increase for the eight months ended august  over the same period in the prior year 
after hurricane ivan no overnight tourist visitors were allowed on to the island until the end of november 
table of contents hurricane ivan reduced our budgeted cayman islands retail sales for september by more than half 
in the last half of september  our operations were operating at limited capacity  due to the damage to our plants and many of our retail customers were unable to take any water due to damage to their premises 
since hurricane ivan we have repaired our plants and are able to meet the demand with our current facilities 
the sales trends since the hurricane indicate that subsequent to hurricane ivan water sales were higher than anticipated due to the clean up efforts but december water sales in our tourist market were down and residential sales were down compared to december january sales trends indicate that water sales are reduced from january levels but more in line with results 
revenue from our bulk water bulk operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to an additional month of revenue from our acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited operations and seven months of revenue from our acquisition of waterfields company limited operations when compared to our bulk operations on the cayman islands were less affected by hurricane ivan than our cayman islands retail operations 
the sales volume is higher for the fourth quarter compared to the same period in revenues from our belize operations declined by during due to the reduced water rates in the new long term contract which was signed in and came into full effect on june  after all conditions precedent had been met or waived 
these reduced rates have been partially offset by reduced annual amortization costs on an intangible asset representing the belize water sale contract  which is now being amortized over years 
the new contract  however  made us the exclusive producer of potable water for our customer on ambergris caye for the term of the agreement 
revenue from services services decreased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
all services revenues pertain to desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
the decrease was due to fewer construction projects and the related decrease in engineering fees that are charged on labour and material costs associated with these projects 
during  we substantially completed our existing construction projects and did not commence any new construction projects 
other income expenses total other income expenses increased by from income of  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to both decreased interest expense resulting from the repayment of our bridge loan facility on july  with proceeds from our equity offering and the associated reduction of amortization of financing costs from the prior year and increased profit sharing and equity income from our investment in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
the increase in our equity income from our investment in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
was due to increased sales 
in  we completed the expansion of this plant but were unable to increase sales due to damaged distribution equipment of our customer 
in  our customer made significant repairs to its distribution system 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in during this same period  our total revenue increased by 

table of contents cost of sales of our retail operations increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while our retail revenue increased by for the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from additional variable costs related to the production of the additional water sold up to september  when hurricane ivan damaged our cayman island operations 
from that point until december  we produced significantly less water than last year but still incurred fixed operating costs 
cost of sales of our bulk operations increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while our bulk revenue increased by for the same period 
this increase in cost of sales was due to an additional month of expenses from our ocean conversion cayman limited operations and an additional seven months of expenses from our waterfields company limited operations when compared to this increase also resulted from increased maintenance costs in our belize operations 
we have changed management and a number of other staff in our belize operations and are working successfully to reduce these unscheduled repair costs by improving the capabilities of our staff and preventative maintenance program 
cost of sales of our services reporting segment increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to additional labour expense because of an increase in idle time resulting from reduced construction projects 
in addition  the increase in cost of sales is due to an additional month of operations from both desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
our barbados operation also experienced increased maintenance when compared to  however  the necessary repairs have been made and we do not expect these problems to continue 
gross profit the gross profit margin increased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  for the reasons explained above 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in general and administrative expenses were at and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our retail operations increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is comprised of additional audit costs expensed in related to the work performed on the acquisitions  higher audit fees  legal and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley internal control review process  increases in salaries and bonuses  additional administrative staff costs  increases in director fees and higher insurance premiums 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our bulk operations decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is due to the reduction of our general and administrative expenses in ocean conversion cayman limited resulting from the assimilation of administrative functions of our cayman islands acquisition 
this was offset by additional expenses incurred by our waterfields company limited operations for bank and government fees relating to the exchange of bahamian dollars to us dollars  
table of contents higher directors fees and expenses  and increased legal fees 
the increase was also the result of an additional seven months of expense from our waterfields company limited operations when compared to general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our services reporting segment decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in may  we closed our bermuda office and relocated operations to the cayman islands 
these decreases are the result of assimilation of the administrative functions of that office 
net insurance recovery from hurricane ivan on september and   hurricane ivan significantly affected our cayman islands operations 
as a result  we suffered damage to our seawater conversion plants 
five out of six of our seawater conversion plants suffered minor to moderate damage and our britannia plant suffered catastrophic damage 
based on our assessment  the britannia water production  post treatment and distribution equipment was a total loss and had been included in our insurance claim 
we met all of our customers water demands without this plant in operation and expected to replace this equipment before the end of may our remaining production capacity was sufficient to meet the needs of our customers until the production capacity of our britannia plant was replaced 
the britannia plant was rebuilt and re commissioned in october with an expanded production capacity of  us gallons per day 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to record the loss of any property  which must be replaced or now has a revised useful life  in the period the loss occurs  and record any gain from the related insurance claim only when the recovery is probable 
we estimated a loss of  consisting of plant and equipment of  spare parts inventories of  and  relating to the rebuilding of the cayman islands operations as of december  these amounts were recorded as part of income from operations as an unusual gain in the income statement as net insurance recovery due to hurricane ivan 
the company also suffered loss of profits during the period that we were unable to sell water to our cayman islands customers and we have quantified this loss of profits at  this has been fully covered as part of claim for such loss to our insurer under our loss of profits insurance 
in february  we accepted a final settlement from the insurance company of  offsetting our total loss of  net income net income increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in liquidity and capital resources overview our cash flows are dependent upon the timely receipt of customer payments  operating expenses  the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases excluding automatic adjustments to our rates for inflation and electricity costs and various factors affecting tourism in the areas we operate such as weather conditions and the world economy
