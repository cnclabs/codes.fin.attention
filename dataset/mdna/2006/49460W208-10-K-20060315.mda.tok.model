item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general kinetic concepts  inc is a global medical technology company with leadership positions in advanced wound care and therapeutic surfaces 
we design  manufacture  market and service a wide range of proprietary products that can improve clinical outcomes and can help reduce the overall cost of patient care 
our advanced wound care systems incorporate our proprietary vac technology  which has been demonstrated clinically to help promote wound healing and can help reduce the cost of treating patients with serious wounds 
our therapeutic surfaces  including specialty hospital beds  mattress replacement systems and overlays  are designed to address pulmonary complications associated with immobility  to prevent skin breakdown and assist caregivers in the safe and dignified handling of obese patients 
we have an infrastructure designed to meet the specific needs of medical professionals and patients across all health care settings  including acute care hospitals  extended care facilities and patients homes both in the united states and abroad 
we have direct operations in the united states  canada  western europe  australia  singapore  japan and south africa  and we conduct additional business through distributors in latin america  the middle east  eastern europe and asia 
we manage our business in two geographical segments usa and international 
operations in the united states accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  we derive our revenue from both the rental and sale of our products 
in the us acute care and extended care settings  which accounted for more than half of our us revenue in  we directly bill our customers  such as hospitals and extended care facilities 
in the us home care setting  where our revenue comes predominantly from vac systems  we provide products and services directly to patients and we directly bill third party payers  such as medicare and private insurance 
internationally  most of our revenue is generated from the acute care setting 
for the last several years  our growth has been driven primarily by increased revenue from vac system revenue  which accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   up from in historically  we have experienced a seasonal slowing of vac revenue growth beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first quarter  which we believe has been caused by year end clinical treatment patterns  such as the postponement of elective surgeries  and increased discharges of individuals from the acute care setting around the holidays 
we believe that the historical growth in our vac revenue has been due in part to the reimbursement code assigned to our vac systems and disposables by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
while in the past vac systems and disposables have been the only devices assigned to the codes for negative pressure wound therapy  a pump and dressing kits marketed by bluesky medical group  inc have recently been assigned to the same negative pressure wound therapy codes under the healthcare common procedure coding system 
also  the existing code for reimbursement of vac disposable canisters was eliminated effective december   which now requires us to bill medicare part b for vac canisters under an alternate existing code at a lower reimbursement rate 
as a result  we may experience increased competition from bluesky products in future periods and the pricing we receive from other third party payers may be negatively impacted  either of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we believe we have the following competitive strengths product innovation and commercialization 
we have a successful track record in pioneering new wound care and therapeutic surface technologies 
our recent development and commercialization of new vac systems and disposable dressing variations have strengthened kci s leadership position in advanced wound care 
we have also developed and commercialized a broad spectrum of therapeutic surfaces  a number of which have significantly enhanced patient care 
our most recent innovation in therapeutic surfaces is rotoprone therapy  an advanced patient care system for the treatment and prevention of pulmonary complications associated with immobility 
proning therapy may improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 
superior clinical efficacy 
the superior clinical efficacy of our vac systems and our therapeutic surfaces is supported by an extensive collection of published clinical studies  peer reviewed journal articles  and textbook citations  which aid adoption by clinicians 
broad reach and customer relationships 
our worldwide sales team  consisting of approximately  individuals  including approximately employees with clinical backgrounds  has strong relationships with our customers due to the clinical support and consultation we provide and our education and training programs 
we also have broad reach across all health care settings 
in the united states  for example  we have relationships with over  acute care hospitals  approximately  extended care facilities and over  home health care agencies and wound care clinics 
extensive service center network 
with a network of us and international service centers  we are able to rapidly deliver our critically needed products to major hospitals in the united states  canada  australia and most major european countries 
our network gives us the ability to deliver our products to any major level i domestic trauma center within hours 
this extensive network is critical to securing national gpo contracts and allows us to efficiently serve the home market directly 
our network also provides a platform for the introduction of additional products 
reimbursement expertise 
a significant portion of our vac revenue is derived from home placements  which are reimbursed by third party payers such as private insurance  managed care  medicare and medicaid 
we have dedicated significant time and resources to develop capabilities and expertise in third party reimbursement  and we have developed systems to support and manage the deployment of our domestic and international sales and service efforts 
we believe that the key factors underlying vac growth over the past year have been improving vac adoption among customers and physicians  both in terms of the number of users and the extent of use by each customer or physician 
market expansion by adding new wound type indications for vac use and increasing the percentage of wounds that are considered good candidates for vac therapy 
recent advances include the launch of the vac granufoam silver dressing for use in infected wounds 
strengthening our contractual relationships with third party payers 
we continue to focus our marketing and selling efforts on increasing physician awareness and adoption of the benefits of vac therapy 
these efforts are targeted at physician specialties that provide care to the majority of patients with wounds in our target categories 
within these specialties  we focus on those clinicians who serve the largest number of wound care patients 
in order to meet our goals of increasing physician awareness  we increased our total sales force by approximately employees in and employees in our intellectual property is very important to maintaining our competitive position 
specifically with respect to our vac business  we rely on our rights under the wake forest patents licensed to us and a number of kci patents in the us and internationally 
continuous enhancements in product portfolio and positioning are also important to our continued growth and market penetration 
we believe our advanced vac systems have increased customer acceptance and the perceived value of vac therapy 
we have benefited from the introduction of specialized dressing systems designed to improve ease of use and effectiveness in treating pressure ulcers and serious abdominal wounds 
at the same time  ongoing clinical experience and studies  such as the randomized  controlled clinical trial of vac for the treatment of amputation wound of the diabetic foot  which we sponsored and that was published in november in the lancet  have increased the market acceptance of vac and expanded the range of wounds considered to be good candidates for vac therapy 
we believe this growing base of data and clinical experience has driven the trend toward use of the vac on a routine basis for appropriate wounds

the unit increase was partially offset by a decline in the average vac rental pricing during  generally attributable to moving non contracted payers in the home care market to contracted pricing 
entering into payer agreements with non contracted payers has the effect of decreasing the price paid by such payers while improving the protocols and payment cycles of such payers 
domestic vac sales revenue of approximately million in increased from the prior year 
this was due primarily to higher sales volumes for vac disposables associated with the increase in vac system unit rentals and the shift away from all inclusive pricing arrangements with managed care organizations

critical accounting estimates the sec defines critical accounting estimates as those that are  in management s opinion  very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we must often make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that are most subject to important estimates or assumptions are described below

we recognize rental revenue based on the number of days a product is in use by the patient facility and the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and generally  retail price for non contracted customers 
sales revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title has transferred 
in addition  we establish reserves against revenue to provide for adjustments including capitation agreements  evaluation free trial days  credit memos  volume discounts  pricing adjustments  utilization adjustments  product returns  cancellations  estimated uncollectible amounts and payer adjustments based on historical experience 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we utilize a combination of factors in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable 
for unbilled receivables  we establish reserves against revenue to allow for denied or uncollectible items 
in addition  items that remain unbilled for more than a specified period of time  or beyond an established billing window  are reserved against revenue 
for billed receivables  we generally establish reserves against revenue and bad debt based on a combination of factors including historic adjustment rates for credit memos and cancelled transactions  the portion of revenue not expected to be collected and  based on historical experience  the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the reserve rates vary by payer group 
in addition  we have recorded specific reserves for bad debt when we become aware of a customer s inability or refusal to satisfy its debt obligations  such as in the event of a bankruptcy filing 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected claims denials  payment defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s or payer s ability to meet its obligations  our estimates of the realizability of amounts due from trade receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
we expect our receivables will continue to grow as a result of growth in our revenue 
however  we may not be able to reduce the number of days receivable outstanding  and as such  our receivables may grow at the same pace or faster than revenue  resulting in variability in our historical reserve adjustments 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
inventory expected to be converted into equipment for short term rental is reclassified to property  plant and equipment 
we review our inventory balances monthly for excess sale products or obsolete inventory levels 
except where firm orders are on hand  inventory quantities of sale products in excess of the last twelve months demand are considered excess and are reserved at of cost 
for rental products  we review both product usage and product life cycle to classify inventory as active  discontinued or obsolete 
obsolescence reserve balances are established on an increasing basis from for active  high demand products to for obsolete products 
the reserve is reviewed  and if necessary  adjustments made on a monthly basis 
we rely on historical information and material requirements planning forecasts to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment for high risk items  such as products that have a fixed shelf life 
once the inventory is written down  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
effective january   we applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  in our accounting for goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the reporting unit  which is the same as the segment to which they are assigned 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were initially tested for impairment during  and determined that there was no impairment 
the most recent annual test completed in the fourth quarter of reconfirmed the lack of impairment 
the goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal or business climate  an adverse regulatory action or unanticipated competition 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
betterments  which extend the useful life of the equipment  are capitalized 
depreciation on property  plant and equipment is calculated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives to years for buildings and between three and five years for most of our other property and equipment of the assets 
we have not had an event that would indicate impairment of our tangible long lived assets 
if an event were to occur  we would review property  plant and equipment for impairment using an undiscounted cash flow analysis and if an impairment had occurred on an undiscounted basis  we would compute the fair market value of the applicable assets on a discounted cash flow basis and adjust the carrying value accordingly 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
liabilities are recorded for probable income tax assessments based on estimates of potential tax related exposures 
recording of these assessments requires significant judgment  as uncertainties often exist in respect to new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and assumptions  or changes in assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
at december  deferred tax assets recorded by the company decreased from due principally to the realization of a net tax operating loss resulting from tax deductions related to employee stock option exercises 
the federal net operating loss was carried back to prior tax years  and a refund of previously paid federal income tax is expected in remaining state net operating losses will be carried forward over the next several years 
we anticipate that the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future income will provide sufficient taxable income to realize the tax benefit of these losses  therefore we have not provided a valuation allowance 
we have  however  established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets associated with foreign nols  certain foreign deferred tax assets and state research and development credits to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
an increase to net income would occur if we were to determine that we are able to utilize more of these deferred tax assets than currently expected 
income taxes increased million  or  in  and million  or  in the increases in income taxes in both years were due primarily to increases in income before income tax 
our effective tax rate in was compared to in the prior year 
the income tax rate reduction was primarily attributable to a higher portion of our taxable income being generated in lower tax jurisdiction  as well as the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax audits 
legal proceedings and other loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  many involving routine litigation incidental to our business 
the outcome of any legal proceeding is not within our complete control  is often difficult to predict and is resolved over very long periods of time 
estimating probable losses associated with any legal proceedings or other loss contingencies is very complex and requires the analysis of many factors including assumptions about potential actions by third parties 
loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable or known that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable  in accordance with financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount of the range is recorded as a liability 
if a loss contingency is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  inventory costs 
this pronouncement amended the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas as of january  and does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method under apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of earnings based on their fair values on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which a grantee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
kci adopted sfas r on january  using a modified prospective application 
as such  the compensation expense recognition provisions will apply to new awards and to any awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date 
additionally  for any unvested awards outstanding at the adoption date  kci will recognize compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
kci completed evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r on its results of operations 
kci has historically determined the fair value of stock based compensation using a black scholes option pricing model 
we will continue to use the black scholes option pricing model  as we do not believe that we have enough historical data to support an alternative model 
based on the black scholes option pricing model and its current assumptions  kci anticipates the adoption of sfas r will result in additional compensation expense of approximately million  after taxes  for  however  actual amounts could differ based on variability in actual grants in and variability in the factors used to estimate this expense 
sfas r also requires that realized tax benefits in excess of tax benefits on recognized compensation costs be reported as financing cash flows  rather than as operating cash flows as currently required 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the tax benefit amounts recognized as operating cash flows in and were million and million  respectively  the majority of which would have been required to be reported as financing cash flows under the new accounting pronouncement 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas as of january  and does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material adverse impact on its results of operations or its financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates and variability in currency exchange rates 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risk and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risk 
interest rate risk we have variable interest rate debt and other financial instruments  which are subject to interest rate risk and could have a negative impact on our business if not managed properly 
we have a risk management policy  which is designed to reduce the potential negative earnings effect arising from the impact of fluctuating interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk on our borrowings through interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert a portion of our variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis through august   thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expenses 
we do not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we have three interest rate swap agreements pursuant to which we have fixed the rates on million  or  of our variable rate debt as follows per annum on million of our variable rate debt through august   per annum on million of our variable rate debt through august   and per annum on million of our variable rate debt through august  the tables below provide information about our long term debt and interest rate swaps  both of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates  as of december  and december  for long term debt  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date dollars in thousands maturity date as of december  thereafter total fair value long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed notional amount average pay rate average receive rate maturity date as of december  thereafter total fair value long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed notional amount average pay rate average receive rate interest rate swaps are included in the variable rate debt under long term debt 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements were positive in the aggregate and were recorded as an asset at december  and foreign currency and market risk we have direct operations in western europe  canada  australia and south africa and distributor relationships in many other parts of the world 
our foreign operations are measured in their applicable local currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
exposure to these fluctuations is managed primarily through the use of natural hedges  whereby funding obligations and assets are both managed in the applicable local currency 
kci faces transactional currency exposures when its foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
these nonfunctional currency exposures relate primarily to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
kci enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions 
at december  we had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase approximately  and sell million of various currencies 
based on our overall transactional currency rate exposure  movements in the currency rates will not materially affect our financial condition 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on their outstanding forward currency exchange contracts  but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
international operations reported operating profit of million for the year ended december  we estimate that a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
our analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities
