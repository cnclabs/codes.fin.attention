dividends 
the federal reserve board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses the federal reserve board s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the federal reserve board  the federal reserve board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized 
see regulation and supervision of the bank prompt corrective regulatory action

the federal reserve board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve board order  directive  or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve board 
this requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are well capitalized  well managed and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 
acquisitions 
the company is required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board to acquire all  or substantially all  of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or merge with another bank holding company 
prior federal reserve board approval will also be required for the company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if  after giving effect to such acquisition  the company would  directly or indirectly  own or control more than of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company 
in evaluating such transactions  the federal reserve board considers such matters as the financial and managerial resources of and future prospects of the companies involved  competitive factors and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
bank holding companies may acquire additional banks in any state  subject to certain restrictions such as deposit concentration limits 
with certain exceptions  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities  which  by statute or by federal reserve board regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking 
the activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the bhca and the related federal reserve board regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act of authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions  including being well capitalized and well managed  to opt to become a financial holding company  and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted 
such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking 
the federal reserve board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
under the change in bank control act of the cbca  a day prior written notice must be submitted to the federal reserve board if any person including a company  or any group acting in concert  seeks to acquire of any class of the company s outstanding voting securities  unless the federal reserve board determines that such acquisition will not result in a change of control of the bank 
under the cbca  the federal reserve board has days within which to act on such notice taking into consideration certain factors  including the financial and managerial resources of the proposed acquiror  the convenience and needs of the community served by the bank and the antitrust effects of an acquisition 
under the bhca  any company would be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve board before it may obtain control of the company within the meaning of the bhca

under indiana banking law  prior approval of the indiana department of financial institutions is also required before any person may acquire control of an indiana stock savings bank  bank or bank holding company 
the department will issue a notice approving the transaction if it determines that the persons proposing to acquire the savings bank  bank or bank holding company are qualified in character  experience and financial responsibility  and the transaction does not jeopardize the interests of the public 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
these requirements are substantially similar to those applicable to the bank 
see regulation and supervision of the bank capital requirements 

table of contents regulation and supervision of the bank general 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic 
the lending activities and other investments of the bank must comply with various regulatory requirements 
the indiana department of financial institutions and fdic periodically examine the bank for compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the bank must file reports with the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic describing its activities and financial condition 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere in this form k 
the regulatory discussion  however  does not purport to be an exhaustive treatment of applicable laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety be reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
capital requirements 
under fdic regulations  state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital requirement consisting of a ratio of tier capital to total assets of if the fdic determines that the institution is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and has well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and in general  a strong banking organization  rated composite under the uniform financial institutions rating system the camels rating system established by the federal financial institutions examination council 
for all but the most highly rated institutions meeting the conditions set forth above  the minimum leverage capital ratio is 
tier capital is the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus all intangible assets other than certain mortgage servicing assets  purchased credit card relationships  credit enhancing interest only strips and certain deferred tax assets  identified losses  investments in certain financial subsidiaries and non financial equity investments 
in addition to the leverage capital ratio the ratio of tier i capital to total assets  state chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least half must be tier capital 
qualifying total capital consists of tier capital plus tier capital also referred to as supplementary capital items 
tier capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over years  certain other capital instruments and up to of pre tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the institution s tier capital 
qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes  reciprocal cross holdings of capital securities issued by other banks  most intangible assets and certain other deductions 
under the fdic risk weighted system  all of a bank s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk weight categories from to  based on the risks inherent in the type of assets or item 
the aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category 
the sum of these weighted values equals the bank s risk weighted assets 
at december   the bank s ratio of tier capital to total assets was  its ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was 
during the second quarter of  the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the fdic and the dfi 
among other things  the mou required the bank to adopt written action plans with respect to certain classified assets  revise its lending policies  require greater financial information from borrowers  establish a loan review program and certain other internal controls 
the fdic and the dfi released the bank from the mou during the third quarter of the release of the mou was contingent on the bank s adoption of a resolution that required the bank to continue reducing the level of assets as substandard  formulate and implement a written profit plan  abstain from purchasing additional bank owned life insurance policies  formalize policies for leveraging strategies and maintain tier capital at or above of assets 
the bank adopted the resolution on june  
table of contents investment activities 
since the enactment of federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  all state chartered fdic insured banks  including savings banks  have generally been limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act and the fdic regulations permit exceptions to these limitations 
the fdic is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks other than non subsidiary equity investments if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the bank insurance fund 
the fdic has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments 
the gramm leach bliley act of specifies that a non member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes 
investment banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  permits adequately capitalized bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state subject to specified concentration limits and other conditions 
the interstate banking act also authorizes the interstate merger of banks 
in addition  among other things  the interstate banking act permits banks to establish new branches on an interstate basis provided that such action is specifically authorized by the law of the host state 
dividend limitations 
the bank may not pay dividends on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would thereby be reduced below the amount then required for the liquidation account established for the benefit of certain depositors of the bank at the time of its conversion to stock form 
in addition  the bank may not pay dividends that exceed retained net income for the applicable calendar year to date  plus retained net income for the preceding two years without prior approval from the indiana department of financial institutions 
the company s board of directors have also resolved not to cause the bank to pay dividends if its tier capital would be less than thereafter 
at december   the shareholder s equity of the bank was million 
earnings of the bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to stockholders without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions 
see federal and state taxation 
under fdic regulations  the bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if  after making the distribution  the bank would have i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than 
for additional information about dividend limitations see note in the consolidated financial statements 
deposit insurance 
the bank is required to pay assessments to the fdic for insurance of its deposits by the saif based on a percentage of the bank s insured deposits 
the fdic is required to set semi annual assessments for saif insured institutions at a rate determined by the fdic to be necessary to maintain the designated reserve ratio of the saif at of estimated insured deposits or at a higher percentage of insured deposits that the fdic determines to be justified for that year by circumstances raising a significant risk of substantial future losses to the saif 
in the event that the saif should fail to meet its statutory reserve ratio  the fdic would be required to set semi annual assessment rates for saif members that are sufficient to increase the reserve ratio to within one year or in accordance with such other schedule that the fdic adopts by regulation to restore the reserve ratio within years 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution is determined by the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic based on the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
based on the data reported to regulators for date closest to the last day of the fourth month preceding the semi annual assessment period  institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using the same percentage criteria as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
see prompt corrective regulatory action below 
within each capital group  institutions are assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 

table of contents the fdic has adopted an assessment schedule for saif deposit insurance pursuant to which the assessment rate for well capitalized institutions with the highest supervisory ratings is zero and institutions in the worst risk assessment classification are assessed at the rate of of insured deposits 
at december   the bank is considered well capitalized 
in addition  fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to help fund interest payments on certain bonds issued by the financing corporation  an agency of the federal government established to finance takeovers of insolvent thrifts 
federal deposit insurance reform act of the federal deposit insurance reform act of the act  signed by the president on february   revised the laws governing the federal deposit insurance system 
the act provides for the consolidation of the saif and the bank insurance fund into a combined deposit insurance fund 
under the act  insurance premiums are to be determined by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic based on a number of factors  primarily the risk of loss that insured institutions pose to the deposit insurance fund 
the legislation eliminates the current minimum reserve ratio for the insurance funds  the mandatory assessments when the ratio fall below and the prohibition on assessing the highest quality banks when the ratio is above 
the act provides the fdic with flexibility to adjust the new insurance fund s reserve ratio between and  depending on projected losses  economic changes and assessment rates at the end of a calendar year 
the act increased deposit insurance coverage limits from  to  for certain types of individual retirement accounts  k plans and other retirement savings accounts 
while it preserved the  coverage limit for individual accounts and municipal deposits  the fdic was furnished with the discretion to adjust all coverage levels to keep pace with inflation beginning in also  institutions that become undercapitalized will be prohibited from accepting certain employee benefit plan deposits 
the consolidation of the saif and bank insurance fund must occur no later than the first day of the calendar quarter that begins days after the date of the act s enactment  ie  july  the act also states that the fdic must promulgate final regulations implementing the remainder of its provisions not later than days after its enactment 
at this time  management cannot predict the effect  if any  that the act will have on insurance premiums paid by the bank 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution may be i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters  under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized institution  as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  may be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization  broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates  limitations on interest rates paid on deposits  asset growth and other activities  possible replacement of directors and officers  and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution 
any company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest subsidiaries 
the senior executive officers of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated debt 
at their discretion  the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective provisions 
if an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the critically undercapitalized level established by law  ie  a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of or less  the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified time periods 
tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less all intangible assets other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 

table of contents under the implementing regulations  the federal banking regulators generally measure an institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
the following table shows the capital ratios required for the various prompt corrective action categories 
well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than leverage ratio or more or more less than less than if institution has a composite camels rating 
the fdic may reclassify a well capitalized depository institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized if the fdic determines  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  that the savings institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any camels rating category 
safety and soundness guidelines 
each federal banking agency was required to establish safety and soundness standards for the depository institutions under its authority 
the interagency guidelines require depository institutions to maintain internal controls and information systems and internal audit systems that are appropriate for the size  nature and scope of the institution s business 
the guidelines also establish certain basic standards for loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure and asset growth 
the guidelines further provide that depository institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation  fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss  and should take into account factors such as compensation practices at comparable institutions 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that a depository institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines  it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines 
a depository institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to its primary federal regulator within days of receipt of a request for such a plan 
failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management believes that the bank meets all the standards adopted in the interagency guidelines 
enforcement 
the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks  including the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the fdic has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances 
the fdic is required  with certain exceptions  to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non member bank if that banks was critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized 
the fdic may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events  including insolvency  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices  existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  and insufficient capital  or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance 
reserve requirements 
under federal reserve board regulations  the bank currently must maintain average daily reserves equal to of net transaction accounts over million up to million  plus on the remainder 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
at december   the bank met applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements

risk factors an investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks 
before deciding to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this form k  including the items included as exhibits 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
a significant percentage of our assets are invested in lower yielding investments  which has contributed to our low profitability 
our results of operations are substantially dependant on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the low interest rate environment that existed in through mid led to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our one to four family loans 
these loans were subsequently sold to minimize the potential interest rate risk associated with maintaining such long term low interest loans in portfolio 
the proceeds from such loans sales were invested in government agency securities 
additionally  during such period  our residential loan production decreased due to reduced demand in our market area 
accordingly  at december   of our assets were invested in investment and mortgage backed securities 
these investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio 
to counteract this  in  we devoted more resources towards loan production  specifically residential and commercial real estate lending  with the goal of investing a greater proportion of our assets in loans 
we have also made efforts to reduce our cost of funds  through more disciplined and effective pricing strategies  and to reduce our operating expenses  by reducing staffing levels and freezing our pension plan in june together  these efforts are designed to increase our net interest income 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to increase the origination of loans  successfully reduce our cost of funds or operating expenses or that we will be able to successfully implement this strategy 
certain interest rate movements may hurt our earnings 
interest rates have recently been at historically low levels 
however  since june   the us federal reserve has increased its target for the federal funds rate fifteen times  from to 
while these short term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our deposits have increased  longer term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our longer term loans have not 
this flattening of the market yield curve has resulted in our interest rate spread declining from at december  to at december  and net interest margin declining from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  if short term interest rates continue to rise  and if rates on our deposits and borrowings continue to reprice upwards faster than the rates on our long term loans and investments  we would experience further compression of our interest rate spread and net interest margin  which would have a negative effect on our profitability 
our increased emphasis on commercial and construction lending may expose us to increased lending risks 
at december   our loan portfolio consisted of million  or of commercial real estate loans  million  or of construction loans and million  or of commercial business loans 
we intend to continue to increase our emphasis on the origination of commercial and construction lending 
however  these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property  the income stream of the borrowers and  for construction loans  the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
commercial business loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower s business and are secured by non real estate collateral that may depreciate over time 
in addition  since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our commercial and construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 

table of contents our relatively high level of non performing loans and classified assets expose us to increased lending risks 
further  our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
at december   our non performing loans totaled million  representing of total loans 
in addition  loans that we have classified as either substandard  doubtful or loss totaled million  representing of total loans 
if these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  we may experience loan losses  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 
our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our cost of operations is high relative to our assets 
our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses costs could hurt our profits 
our operating expenses  which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment expense  professional fees and data processing expense  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio totaled for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we have made a concerted effort to control our expenses and operate more efficiently  through such actions as reducing personnel and freezing of our pension plan 
however  the failure to reduce our expenses could hurt our profits 
strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which reduces net interest income 
according to the federal deposit insurance corporation  as of june   we held of the deposits in henry county  indiana  which was the largest market share of deposits out of the four financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
we also held of the deposits in hancock county  indiana  which was the th largest market share of deposits out of the ten financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area 

table of contents if we do not achieve profitability on our new branch  it may negatively impact our earnings 
we opened our mccordsville branch office in february numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch  such as a suitable location  qualified personnel and an effective marketing strategy 
additionally  it takes time for a new branch to generate significant deposits and make sufficient loans to produce enough income to offset expenses  some of which  like salaries and occupancy expense  are relatively fixed costs 
we expect that it may take a period of time before the new branch office can become profitable 
during this period  operating this new branch office may negatively impact our net income 
if the value of real estate in central indiana were to decline materially  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
with most of our loans concentrated in central indiana  a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans 
a decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral  making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans 
additionally  a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses  which would hurt our profits 
also  a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse 
real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions  including  among other things  changes in general or regional economic conditions  governmental rules or policies and natural disasters 
our business is subject to the success of the local economy in which we operate 
because the majority of our borrowers and depositors are individuals and businesses located and doing business in central indiana our success significantly depends to a significant extent upon economic conditions in central indiana 
adverse economic conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international disorders  terrorism and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our profitability 
we are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in indiana could adversely affect the value of our assets  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  we cannot give any assurance we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur 
the trading history of our common stock is characterized by low trading volume 
our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
although our common stock trades on nasdaq national market  it has not been regularly traded 
we cannot predict whether a more active trading market in our common stock will occur or how liquid that market might become 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time  which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors  over which we have no control 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in interest rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate  press releases  announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors  future sales of our common stock  
table of contents changes in economic conditions in our marketplace  general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the banking industry  and other developments affecting our competitors or us 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you desire 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance

gassen  our current president and ceo  started with the company on june  strategic summary we have concentrated on improving the soundness of our organization as evidenced by the significant recoveries of past loan and lease losses and dramatic improvement in asset quality 
these efforts had a positive impact on earnings in and should lead to increased profitability in the future 
we have also made a concerted effort to reduce our expenses and operate more efficiently 
we project our net interest margin  which was in  may decline basis points in the first half of before it starts to improve in the latter half of the year 
the federal reserve increased short term interest rates basis points in january  which led to an inverted yield curve in the first quarter 
we project the federal reserve will increase short term interest rates another to basis points before midyear and leave rates unchanged for the remainder of the year 
we further project that short term rates will begin to decline in early our interest bearing liabilities re price to current market conditions faster than our interest earning assets 
most of the variable rate mortgage loans in our portfolio lag the market days when they are scheduled to re price 
a stabilized short term interest rate environment in the second half of would provide interest earning assets an opportunity to catch up  leading to an expected improvement in the net interest margin 
we also expect an improvement in the mix of interest earning assets in that may further improve the net interest margin 
about of our investment securities portfolio at december   consisting primarily of government agency securities  earns an average yield of  basis points below our cost of funds 
we will receive steady cash flows from these securities as they mature over a twenty month period starting in the second quarter of the cash flows from these securities will be used to pay down short term borrowings and fund new loan volume 
the steady redeployment of cash flows from the investment portfolio into higher yielding assets should improve the net interest margin

table of contents critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  and such estimates and assumptions are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for non commercial loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each loan category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger  non homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of imprecision risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets

residential loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  in recent years  fixed rate residential mortgage loans made up most of the new loan volume and were sold to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk 
in  as the interest rate for fixed rate financing began to increase  the demand for fixed rate financing declined while the demand for variable rate financing grew 
we retained new variable rate residential mortgage loans in our loan portfolio which resulted in residential loan portfolio growth

construction loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to commercial real estate development loans which resulted from the addition of new commercial lenders 
commercial loans declined million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to principal pay downs on lease loans purchased from an indiana based financial institution 
consumer loans declined  to million at december  from million at december  we placed less emphasis on consumer lending in recent years

residential loan production increased to million in from million in commercial real estate and construction loan production increased to million in from million in credit quality non performing assets declined million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily related to three real estate development loans 
the first is a commercial real estate loan for a condominium project in lafayette  indiana  with a principal balance of million that was classified as non accrual in december of this loan was partially charged down by  in the second was for a real estate development lot loan for a builder developer

borrowings borrowings increased million to million at december  from million at december  our borrowings consist of fhlb advances totaling million and a note payable of  the increase in borrowings was necessary to fund loan growth 
note payable declined  to  at december  from  at december  note payable is to a third party financial institution bearing interest at and at december  and  respectively  the proceeds of which were used to finance stock repurchases during interest rate risk interest rate risk irr is the risk to earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates 
irr can result from timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as call or convertible options  loan prepayments  interest rate caps  and deposit withdrawals  unexpected shifts of the yield curve that affect both the slope and shape of the yield curve and  differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk 
an example would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 

table of contents the asset liability committee and the board of directors review our exposure to interest rate changes and market risk quarterly 
this review is accomplished by the use of a cash flow simulation model using detailed securities  loan  deposit  borrowings and market information to estimate fair values of assets and liabilities using discounted cash flows 
we monitor irr from two perspectives economic value at risk long term exposure the difference between the bank s estimated fair value of assets and the estimated fair value of liabilities is the fair value of equity  also referred to as net present value of equity npv 
the change in the npv is calculated at different interest rate intervals 
this measures our irr exposure from movements in interest rates and the resulting change in the npv 
earnings at risk near term exposure the model also tests the impact various interest rate scenarios have on net interest income over a stated period of time one year  for example 
we recognize that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the profit and loss statement 
accordingly  we will manage our position so that exposure to net interest income is monitored over both a one year planning horizon accounting perspective and a longer term strategic horizon economic perspective 
our objective is to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that we will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the net interest margin be reduced 
change in irr calculation we changed our emphasis on what we monitor for irr in the npv method was our primary irr measurement in the past 
the npv method uses a liquidation model by simulating a mark to market of the entire balance sheet 
the liquidation model identifies mismatched risk both for the near term and long term 
our primary concern going forward is our irr exposure in the near term by focusing on earnings at risk 
we also changed to a different modeling program which uses similar methodologies and assumptions as the previous model 
the irr calculation results are similar as illustrated in the following table effect of change in net interest income from december  for year and year dollars in thousands projected net interest income change from year base down bp base up bp down bp up bp year old model new model year old model new model the primary difference between the two models is the reinvestment of cash flows 
the old model assumed cash flows were reinvested in the same type of financial instrument where the new model directs cash flows to specific loan types  primarily hybrid adjustable rate mortgages 
current position assessment as of december  led by loan growth  total assets increased to million at december  loan demand centered on commercial construction  hybrid residential adjustable rate mortgages  and home equity lines of credit draws 
while federal reserve rate increases and redeployment of lower yielding investment cash flow into loans have helped push average yields up basis points bp  our average cost of funds escalated bp due to higher short term borrowing costs and a migration of money market deposit accounts mmda and checking account balances to higher coupon certificate of deposits 
the resulting tightening of balance sheet spread offset the positive effect of balance sheet growth 

table of contents the balance sheet appears positioned to produce wider margins over the next two to three years  regardless of the direction of interest rate movements  as lower yielding bullet agency investments mature and are replaced at significantly higher yields 
a falling rate environment appears to be the least beneficial for earnings  reducing the net reinvestment benefit realized as the agency ladder matures and is reinvested 
earnings at risk to rate changes over the next twelve months fall well within policy guidelines of 
interest rate scenarios base case projected net interest income in first year assuming current rates remain unchanged 
net interest income  based on the size and mix of the current balance sheet and rate environment  is expected to improve over the coming months as asset yield improvements outpace cost of funds increases 
this assessment does not take into account continued pricing adjustments to deposit rates should market rate movements cease or additional migration of lower yielding mmda checking balances to certificates of deposits 
falling rates bp projected net interest income declines in first year and increases in second year when compared to base case scenario 
while deposit rate reductions help stabilize margins in the early stages of the scenario  asset yields unwind more rapidly over the second year of the simulation due to the reinvestment risk of the agency ladder as outlined above 
this stalls earnings momentum realized in the base case scenario and leads to a sustained downward trend in earnings 
rising rates bp projected net interest income declines in first year and increases in second year when compared to base case scenario 
deposit rate increases and escalating cost on short term borrowings place an initial drag on earnings if market rates rise 
our earnings trends improve as deposit costs stabilize in the second year of the simulation and larger blocks of asset cash flow cycles through and are replaced in the higher rate environment

table of contents the decline in net interest income  as shown in the table above  was primarily due to the flattening yield curve  which resulted in short term interest rates rising faster than longer term interest rates 
our interest bearing liabilities have shorter overall maturities and reprice more frequently to market conditions than our interest earning assets and  thus  our cost of funds rose quicker than our yield on assets

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the current period credit or cost associated with maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  assessment by management  third parties and banking regulators of the quality of the loan portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral on problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market areas 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we had a provision adjustment of million for compared to a provision of  in the provision adjustment reflected total recoveries of million primarily due to recoveries on the leases 
we recorded net recoveries of million in and net charge offs of million in other income the increase in other income in as compared to resulted primarily from increases in other fees and service charges  and other income  which was partially offset by decreases in gain on sale of loans and servicing rights  brokerage and insurance commissions  and increase on cash surrender value of life insurance 
the increase in other fees and service charges was primarily due to an increase in deposit service charge fees mainly from the overdraft honors program  which began in late the increase in other income was mainly from a  gain on sale of land we owned which was adjacent to our branch lot in greenfield  indiana and which was not needed for expansion purposes 
the decrease in gain on sale of loans and servicing rights was due to a decline in mortgage loans sold during the period 
loans originated for sale were million in compared to million in although residential mortgage loan production was comparable in and  we retained a greater portion of our loans in because we originated more adjustable rate loans 
we sold most of our fixed rate mortgage loan production in however  in  we retained most of the fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans we produced 
fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans generally pose lower interest rate risk than thirty year fixed rate mortgage loans because of their shorter average life 
the decrease in brokerage and insurance commissions was mainly due to a decline in sales because of an extended medical leave by one of our two brokers in the decline in increase on cash surrender value of life insurance was due to lower investment rates 

table of contents other expense the increase in other expense in as compared to resulted primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  legal and professional fees  advertising and marketing  and other expenses  which was partially offset by decreases in printing and office supplies and data processing expense 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in pension expense offset by a reduction in salary expense 
in addition to the increase in pension expense  we also incurred an additional  in health insurance premiums to reimburse our health insurance provider for claims in past plan years that were in excess of the annual cap 
the decline in salary expense was due to reduced staffing levels as a result of improved efficiencies 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to increased depreciation expense related to our mccordsville branch that opened in other occupancy expense categories that contributed to the increase included utilities and repairs and maintenance 
the increase in legal and professional fees was due to consulting fees paid to profit resources for a consulting engagement to improve operational efficiencies and recruiting fees for the chief executive officer  chief lending officer and a commercial loan officer 
the increase in advertising and marketing expense was due to an increase in loan promotions which led to higher advertising and direct mail costs 
the increase in other expenses was in part due to a large donation of  to the city of anderson  indiana for its downtown revitalization project 
the donation was part of an agreement between the city and a group of banks  including us  where the city paid off loans secured by commercial buildings in downtown anderson 
the decrease in printing and office supplies and data processing expenses were due to general expense reductions mainly due to improved operating efficiencies 
income tax expense the increase in income taxes in as compared to resulted primarily from higher net operating earnings and a valuation allowance against our current period state income taxes 
we recorded an income tax expense of  in  compared to an income tax benefit of  in we have a deferred state tax asset that is primarily the result of operating losses sustained since for state tax purposes 
we started recording a valuation allowance against our current period state income tax benefit in due to our concern that we may not be able to use more than the tax asset already recorded on the books without modifying the use of aimi  our investment subsidiary 
operating income from aimi is not subject to state income taxes under current state law  and is the primary reason for the tax asset

we wrote off the remaining balances of these lease pools in and recorded an after tax loss of million 
due to continued uncertainty surrounding the prospects for eventual recovery from the sureties  the fact that one of the insurance companies had its credit rating down graded to d by am best and that the litigation with respect to the enforcement of the surety bonds was proving more protracted and challenging than originally anticipated  we determined to charge off the remaining balances of the lease pools 
we recovered some of the lease losses in for more information see item legal proceedings 
other income the decrease in other income in as compared to resulted primarily from the decline in the net gain on the sale of branches  and net gain on sale of loans and servicing rights 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in other fees and service charges  brokerage and insurance commissions  and other income

on september   we sold two cincinnati area branches to peoples community bancorp  inc the transaction included real property related to the deer park branch and its leasehold on the premises for the landen branch 
additionally  we conveyed most consumer and commercial loans at those branches as part of the transaction  as well as the branches savings deposits  but retained and will continue to service certain single family residential mortgages originated in those locations 
the decline in net gain on sale of loans and servicing rights was due to a drop in the volume of mortgage loan refinancing which resulted in less loans sold 
the low interest rate environment in and kept the demand for mortgage loan refinancing at a high level 
due to the significant decrease in volume of loans refinanced  mortgage loans we originated declined million to million in from million in the increase in other fees and service charges was due to an increase in deposit service charge fees and to the overdraft honors program which began in late the increase in brokerage and insurance commissions was mainly the result of higher brokerage commissions due to increased sales and bonus insurance commissions 
the increase in other income was due to net loan servicing fees which increased due to a decline in mortgage loan refinancing in compared to  which resulted in less write offs of mortgage loan servicing rights remaining on our loans that were refinanced 
mortgage loan servicing rights are assets that are created when mortgage loans are sold and we retain the servicing rights 
the servicing rights are recognized as income at the time the loan is sold and the servicing asset is also recorded 
the asset is then amortized as an expense to mortgage servicing income over the life of the loan

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations of a short term nature 
historically  funds provided by operations  loan repayments and new deposits have been our principal sources of liquid funds

retail certificates of deposit excluding brokered cds due within one year of december  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these maturing certificates of deposit do not remain with us  other sources of funds must be used  including other certificates of deposit  brokered cds  and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than currently paid on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  however  based on past experiences we believe that a significant portion of the certificates of deposit will remain 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
we held a brokered cd for million at december  there were no brokered cds at december  our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and purchase of securities

the company is also subject to similar capital requirements set by the federal reserve bank

at december   both the company and the bank exceeded all of regulatory capital requirements and are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines

such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same rate as changes in the prices of goods and services  which are directly affected by inflation  although interest rates may fluctuate in response to perceived changes in the rate of inflation 
current accounting issues share based compensation in december  fasb issued an amendment to sfas sfas r  which eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
on april   the sec amended the compliance date for sfas r from the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after june  to the next fiscal year beginning after june  the company adopted sfas r as of january  the effect on the company s results of operations depends on the level of future option grants and the calculation of the fair value of the options granted at such future date  as well as the vesting periods provided and possible performance condition requirements  and so cannot currently be predicted for future awards 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
the statement establishes standards for accounting for share based payment transactions 
share based payment transactions are those in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services or in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of these equity instruments 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee stock purchase plans 
as of january   the company applied sfas r using the modified prospective method 
this method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards over the requisite service period generally the vesting schedule 
for liability classified awards  the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on its current fair value 
the fair value is re measured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date  and changes in fair value are recognized as compensation cost 
for equity classified awards  the grant date fair value is recognized in earnings over the requisite service period 
earnings per share the fasb has issued a proposed amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share  to clarify guidance for mandatorily convertible instruments  the treasury stock method  contingently issuable shares  and contracts that may be settled in cash or share 
the primary impact on the company of the proposed statement is the change to the treasury stock method for year to date diluted earnings per share 
currently  sfas no 
requires that the number of incremental shares included in the denominator be determined by computing a year to date weighted average of the number of incremental shares included in each quarterly diluted eps computation 
under this proposed statement  the number of incremental shares included in year to date diluted earnings per share would be computed using the average market price of common shares for the year to date period  independent of the quarterly computations 
this computational change is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s diluted earnings per share
