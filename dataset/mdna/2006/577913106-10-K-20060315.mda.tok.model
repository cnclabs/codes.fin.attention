as a result  the compan y discontinued consolidating kaiser s financial results beginning february  and began reporting its investment in kaiser using the cost method  unde r which the investment is reflected as a single amount on the company s balanc e sheet of million and the recording of earnings or losses from kaise r was discontinued after february  kaiser s plan of reorganization  which provides for the cancellation of th e company s  kaiser common shares without consideration or obligation was confirmed by the kaiser bankruptcy court in february however  kaiser s plan of reorganization is not yet final  as it must still be approved by th e us district court before kaiser can emerge from chapter  and is als o subject to appeal 
these consolidated financial statements do not reflect an y adjustment related to the deconsolidation of kaiser other than presenting th e company s investment in kaiser using the cost method 
the company expects t o reverse the million of losses in excess of its investment in kaiser  ne t of accumulated other comprehensive losses of million related to kaiser and recognize the net amount  including the related tax effects  in the perio d during which kaiser emerges from bankruptcy  which is expected to occur in upon effectiveness of kaiser s plan of reorganization  the company also expect s it will take a worthless stock deduction on its consolidated federal income ta x return related to the cancellation of the kaiser shares and will at that tim e evaluate whether it expects to realize the resulting tax asset of approximatel y million 
although the company does not expect that it will be obligate d to fund losses in kaiser  the amount of the reversal would be reduced by an y losses which the company later estimates it would be obligated to fund

overview of consolidated results of operations net sales net sales for totaled million  compared to million i n sales for the company s real estate segment increased from millio n in to million in this substantial increase was due primaril y to large acreage sales at palmas and mirada  favorable pricing and higher volum e of lot sales at fountain hills and mirada  and higher profit participatio n payments at palmas 
this increase was offset by a million decline in ne t sales for the company s forest products segment and a million decline ne t sales for the racing segment 
net sales for the company s forest product s segment declined due to a decrease in product volume attributable to reduce d harvesting caused by regulatory delays  as well as an unfavorable shift i n lumber sold from redwood to lower priced  common grade douglas fir lumber

risk factors for cautionary information wit h respect to such forward looking statements 
the company s forest products operations are conducted through mgi and it s wholly owned subsidiaries  principally palco  scopac and britt 
the segment s business is becoming increasingly unpredictable due to regulatory constraint s and ongoing litigation challenges and is somewhat seasonal  its net sales havin g historically been higher in the months of april through november than in th e months of december through march 
management expects that the segment s revenue s and cash flows will continue to be unpredictable and somewhat seasonal accordingly  the segment s results for any one quarter are not necessaril y indicative of results to be expected for the full year 
regulatory and environmental matters as well as legal actions have had an d are expected to continue to adversely affect the company s forest product s operations 
see item business forest products operations regulatory an d environmental factors  item a 
risk factors  and note for informatio n regarding these matters 
regulatory compliance and related litigation hav e caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in approval of thps an d delays in harvesting on thps once they are approved 
this has resulted and i s expected to continue to result in a significant decline in harvest and increase d costs related to timber harvest litigation 
the cash flows of palco and scopac have both been adversely impacted by th e failure of the north coast water board to release for harvest a number o f already approved thps 
scopac s management has concluded that  in the absence o f significant regulatory relief and accommodations  scopac s annual timber harves t levels and cash flows from operations will for at least several years b e substantially below both historical levels and the minimum levels necessary t o allow scopac to satisfy its debt service obligations in respect of the timbe r notes 
scopac projects that  without additional liquidity  its cash flows fro m operations  together with funds available under its line of credit  will b e insufficient  by a substantial amount  to pay the entire amount of interest du e on the july   payment date on its timber notes 
scopac also expects t o incur interest shortfalls for at least the next several years after the july payment date 
palco and britt are in default under the million palco term loan an d the million asset based revolving credit facility 
palco estimates tha t without necessary amendments to these credit agreements and or sufficien t additional liquidity  its cash flow from operations  together with fund s available under the palco revolving credit facility  will not provide sufficien t liquidity to fund its current level of operations for the next several years for further information  see financial condition and investing and financin g activities forest products operations 
in the event that palco is unable to secure the necessary liquidity to fun d its expected future working capital shortfalls  it would be forced to tak e extraordinary actions  which may include further reducing expenditures b y laying off employees  shutting down various operations  and seeking protectio n by filing under the bankruptcy code 
to the extent that scopac is unable t o generate sufficient liquidity from the scopac land sale program or othe r sources  the company expects that scopac will be forced to take extraordinar y actions  which may include laying off employees  shutting down variou s operations  and seeking protection by filing under the bankruptcy code 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that other pending legal  regulator y and environmental matters or future governmental regulations  legislation o r judicial or administrative decisions  adverse weather conditions  or low lumbe r or log prices  will not also have material adverse effects on the financia l condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company s forest product s operations

during  comprehensive external and internal reviews were conducted o f palco s business operations 
these reviews were conducted in an effort t o identify ways in which palco could operate on a more efficient an d cost effective basis 
since  palco has implemented a number of changes including closing three of its four sawmills  eliminating certain of it s operations  including its company staffed logging operations now relyin g exclusively on contract loggers  its soil amendment and concrete bloc k activities  and its scotia finishing and remanufacturing plant  and adoptin g various cost saving measures 
palco has continued to examine ways in which t o achieve cost savings 
in april  palco commenced a mill improvement project including a new sawmill located in scotia  california 
the new sawmill wa s constructed in two phases 
the first phase of the project  the processing o f smaller diameter second growth logs up to in diameter is a high spee d processing line that includes advanced scanning and optimization technolog y intended to maximize lumber recovery 
the second phase  the relocation of th e large log equipment from the carlotta mill  came on line in october thi s phase allows for processing of larger logs up to in diameter 
although ther e were more difficulties than palco expected  since commencing production  palc o has made substantial progress in refining the production process in the ne w mill  particularly the high speed small log processing line 
there have bee n delays in the completion of the large log processing line  however  and it i s not yet operating at planned production rates  primarily due to a curren t imbalance between small diameter and large diameter logs which impacts th e mill s throughput 
palco also completed a new million planer project i n scotia in january this high speed system processes rough sawn boards int o finished lumber at rates up to four times faster than the older planers at th e carlotta and fortuna mills 
palco has spent million through december  on the new sawmill million of which was expended in 
fund s for this project were provided from borrowings under the palco term loan and th e palco revolving credit facility

net sales net sales for the forest products segment in were million belo w the prior year s net sales 
the decline was due primarily to a reduction i n total lumber shipments  compounded by an unfavorable shift in lumber sold fro m redwood lumber to lower priced  common grade douglas fir lumber

net sales for the forest products segment in were million belo w the prior year s net sales 
while total lumber shipments were only slightl y lower than the prior year and prices in most categories of lumber improved there was a shift in the mix of products sold from higher priced redwood an d upper grade douglas fir lumber to lower priced common grade douglas fir  whic h produced an overall decline of million in net sales of lumber 
sales o f logs  power and other products  which accounted for of the segment s sale s product mix in  were down a combined million compared to the prio r year 
operating income loss the forest products segment incurred operating losses of million i n and operating income of million in the decline was primaril y attributable to four factors the decline in net sales discussed above  highe r harvesting  hauling  and production costs  substantial legal and professiona l fees relating to the company s efforts to pursue a negotiated restructuring o f the timber notes  and asset impairment charges of million due to changes i n the expected use of certain facilities and revised estimates of undiscounte d cash flows of those facilities 
operating income for the forest products segment was million in which was substantially below the prior year s operating income of million 
the decline was primarily attributable to three factors the decline i n net sales discussed above  an increase in the per unit production cost o f lumber  and the gain of million on the sale of timberlands in th e grizzly creek grove 
per unit lumber production costs were adversely affected b y the declines in harvest  which led to increased third party log purchase s approximating mmbf in  as compared to mmbf in loss before income taxes the loss before income taxes of million  as compared to millio n of losses in  reflects the effects of the factors discussed abov e compounded by additional interest expense related to additional outstandin g debt 
the loss before income taxes increased million in as compared t o  primarily due to the decreases in operating income discussed above 
i n addition  earnings on cash  cash equivalents and other investments declined du e to lower investment balances and lower returns during versus th e declines on returns on investment funds was partially offset by a decrease i n interest expense

regulatory and environmental matters as well as legal actions have had an d are expected to continue to have a significant adverse effect on the company s forest products operations and liquidity 
see item business forest product s operations regulatory and environmental factors  item a 
risk factors  an d note for information regarding these matters 
the ability to harvest scopa c timber as defined in item business forest products operations timber an d timberlands depends in large part upon scopac s ability to obtain regulator y approval of thps 
scopac has experienced difficulties and delays in the approva l of its thps as the result of regulatory and litigation challenges  and expect s these challenges to persist 
moreover  the company expects to continue t o experience further difficulties  limitations and delays in being able to harves t on previously approved thps due to  among other things  the actions by the nort h coast water board described below 
the foregoing matters have resulted i n declines in actual and expected harvest levels and cash flows  a significan t increase in the cost of logging operations and increased costs related to timbe r harvest litigation  all of which have severely and negatively impacted th e historical cash flows of both palco and scopac 
these adverse effects ar e expected to continue 
as discussed in item business forest products operations regulatory an d environmental factors water quality  and item a 
risk factors  the nort h coast water board is requiring palco and scopac to apply various waste discharg e reporting  mitigation and erosion control requirements in respect of timbe r harvesting activities in several watersheds  and is likely to impose or seek t o impose additional measures in the future 
the north coast water board i n december directed its staff to formulate wwdrs for the freshwater and el k river watersheds on the scopac timber property 
as harvesting activities on th e scopac timber property cannot readily be moved between watersheds due to  amon g other things  historic harvest patterns  adjacency restrictions  and the ag e classes of trees  development of wwdrs and the other matters described in ite m business forest products operations regulatory and environmenta l factors water quality  and item a 
risk factors  and the water quality section of note are expected to result in reduced harvest and les s predictability in the future regarding the mix of logs available for sale b y scopac to palco 
the north coast water board for some time failed to release for harvest a number of scopac s thps that had already been approved by the other governmenta l agencies which approve scopac s thps 
the north coast water board subsequentl y allowed harvesting on a portion of the approved thps  however  the state wate r board later disallowed harvesting on a portion of the thps that had bee n released by the north coast water board 
the unreleased and disallowed thps i n the freshwater and elk river watersheds represented a significant portion of th e harvest that was planned for these unreleased and disallowed thps  as wel l as additional thps in the freshwater and elk river watersheds  also represent a significant portion of the harvest planned for as discussed below  scopa c has announced that its projected average annual harvest level over the ten yea r period beginning is estimated to be approximately million board fee t per year 
this projection is significantly below historical harvest levels  an d actual harvest levels and actual harvest levels may be even lower  depending o n the ultimate outcome of various assumptions 
on february   the north coast water board held a status conferenc e to determine a timetable for consideration of approval of wwdrs in th e freshwater and elk river watersheds 
although a formal timetable has not bee n published  it appears likely that wwdrs in these two watersheds will not b e approved before may  such a timetable would further reduce annua l harvest levels 
as a result of these material and ongoing harvesting restrictions  th e company expects that scopac s cash flows from operations  together with fund s available under the scopac line of credit with a group of banks pursuant t o which scopac may borrow to pay interest on its timber notes  will b e insufficient  by a substantial amount  to pay the entire amount of interest du e on the july   payment date 
scopac also expects to incur interes t shortfalls for at least the next several years after the july   paymen t date 
the failure of scopac to pay all of the required amounts of interest o n the timber notes when due would constitute an event of default under timbe r notes indenture 
see the scopac liquidity issues section below for informatio n regarding scopac s efforts to obtain additional liquidity in order to avoid a n event of default under the timber notes indenture 
the scopac line of credit allows scopac to borrow up to one year s interes t on the timber notes 
on june   the scopac line of credit was extended t o july  scopac intends to request that the scopac line of credit b e extended for an additional period of not less than days 
if not extended scopac may draw upon the full amount available 
the amount drawn would b e repayable in semiannual installments on each timber note payment date afte r the payment of certain other items  including the aggregate minimum principa l amortization amount  as defined  then due  commencing approximately two an d one half years following the date of the draw 
at december   the maximu m availability under the scopac line of credit was million  and outstandin g borrowings were million 
at january   the maximum availabilit y under the scopac line of credit was million  after giving effect t o principal payments made on the january   timber notes payment date an d there were million in borrowings outstanding under this facility 
in the event of a failure to pay interest or principal on the timber note s in full when due  the trustee or the holders of at least of the aggregat e outstanding principal amount of the timber notes may cause all principal interest and other amounts related to the timber notes to become immediately du e and payable

palco and britt are currently in default under the palco term loan and th e palco revolving credit facility 
as a waiver has not been obtained  amount s outstanding under the palco term loan and the palco revolving credit facilit y have been classified as a current liability at december  palc o estimates that  without necessary amendments to the palco term loan and th e palco revolving credit facility and or sufficient additional liquidity  its cas h flows from operations  together with funds available from the palco revolvin g credit facility  will not provide sufficient liquidity to fund palco s curren t level of operations for the next several years 
see the palco liquidity issues section below for information regarding palco s efforts to resolve the default s and obtain additional liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capita l shortfalls 
without waivers of the defaults under the palco term loan and the palc o revolving credit facility  the lenders may take any or all of the followin g actions reduce the amount of funds available for borrowing under the palc o revolving credit facility  refuse to make new loans to or issue new letters o f credit under the palco revolving credit facility  declare any or all loans an d other amounts owed under the agreement to be immediately due and payable require borrowers as defined below to cash collateralize all outstandin g letters of credit under the palco revolving credit facility  or pursue thei r other rights and remedies under the palco term loan  palco revolving credi t facility and related security agreements 
as a result of the defaults  the palc o term loan and palco revolving credit facility lenders are requiring palco to pa y interest on amounts borrowed under the palco term loan and palco revolvin g credit facility at a per annum rate higher than the rate at which interes t would be owed if no default existed 
in addition to the material adverse effects being experienced by palco an d scopac due to continuing regulatory  environmental and litigation difficulties there can be no assurance that certain other pending legal  regulatory an d environmental matters or future governmental regulations  additional litigatio n or legislation  judicial or administrative decisions  adverse weathe r conditions  or low lumber or log prices  will not also result in additiona l material adverse effects on the financial condition  results of operations o r liquidity of the company s forest products operations

the liquidity problems being experienced by palco and scopac could resul t in claims against and could have adverse impacts on maxxam parent  mghi and o r mgi 
for example  under erisa law  were palco to terminate its pension plan maxxam parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries would be jointly and severall y liable for any unfunded pension plan obligations 
the unfunded terminatio n obligation attributable to palco s pension plan as of december  i s estimated to have been approximately million based upon current annuit y placement interest rate assumptions 
in addition  it is possible that certai n transactions could be entered into in connection with a potential restructurin g or reorganization of palco or scopac  such as a sale of all or a portion of th e equity ownership in palco and or scopac  a sale of a substantial portion o f palco s and or scopac s assets and or a cancellation of some or all of palco s and or scopac s indebtedness  which could require the utilization of all or a substantial portion of  or the loss of a significant portion of  the company s net operating losses for federal and state income tax purposes and could requir e tax payments 
as discussed above  both palco and scopac continue to experience liquidit y shortfalls and expect their liquidity shortfalls to continue for at least th e next several years 
scopac management estimates that a substantial amount o f additional liquidity  which will vary based on a number of factors  will b e required to fund an anticipated interest shortfall on the july   timbe r notes payment date 
see the palco liquidity issues and scopac liquidity issues section s below for further information regarding palco and scopac s plans to obtain th e additional liquidity to fund their operations and pay debt obligations when due there can be no assurance that their efforts will be successful 
capital expenditures for forest products operations are expected to b e approximately million to million in and palco s minimu m pension funding requirements are estimated to be million 
palco liquidity issues as of december   palco and britt  as borrowers borrowers  wer e in default under the palco term loan and the palco revolving credit facility du e to financial covenant breaches 
the borrowers are pursuing discussions with th e lenders in an effort to resolve the defaults and obtain additional liquidit y necessary to fund anticipated future working capital shortfalls 
there can be no assurance that palco will be able to obtain waivers o f defaults from the lenders 
as of december   million wa s outstanding under the palco term loan  million was outstanding under th e palco revolving credit facility  and million of letters of credit wer e outstanding under the palco revolving credit facility 
the palco revolvin g credit facility and palco term loan are each secured by a security interest i n the stock of palco held by mgi  and substantially all of the assets of th e borrowers other than palco s equity interest in scopac 
in an effort to reduce its overall debt level  palco has commenced th e palco asset sale program pursuant to which it is marketing certain assets  an d is also seeking other sources of liquidity 
the palco term loan and the palc o revolving credit facility each contain provisions requiring that the net cas h proceeds of asset sales be used to prepay amounts outstanding under the tw o facilities 
accordingly  proceeds generated from the palco asset sale progra m would not be available to fund working capital needs until the palco term loa n is paid in full 
there can be no assurance that these marketing efforts will b e successful or that palco will be successful in securing sufficient additiona l liquidity 
in the event that palco is unable to secure the necessary liquidity to fun d its expected future working capital shortfalls  it would be forced to tak e extraordinary actions  which may include further reducing expenditures b y laying off employees  shutting down various operations  and seeking protectio n by filing under the bankruptcy code 
in april  palco and britt  as borrowers  closed the palco term loa n and the palco revolving credit facility 
the million palco term loan wa s fully funded at closing 
the palco revolving credit facility provides fo r borrowings up to a maximum of million  subject to borrowing base and othe r limitations 
during  palco received net cash proceeds of approximatel y million from the palco term loan and palco revolving credit facility an d borrowed an additional million from mgi see note for furthe r discussion 
these borrowings were utilized primarily in the following areas i million was used to pay off amounts previously borrowed under palco s previous revolving credit facility which was terminated  ii approximately million was used to fund capital expenditures related primarily to palco s new sawmill in scotia  california  iii million was used as collateral t o secure palco s workers compensation liabilities which reduced the company s availability under the palco revolving credit facility  iv million wa s used to build primarily large log larger than in diameter inventor y levels  and v the remainder was used to pay advisor fees and to fund workin g capital shortfalls 
the working capital shortfalls experienced in resulte d primarily from delays in completion of the large log processing line at palco s sawmill in scotia 
the sawmill s operational difficulties experienced in related to the large log processing line  compounded palco s liquidit y challenges as palco has been unable to mill its large log inventories purchase d in using the funds available under the palco revolving credit facility i n as planned 
while production levels at the new sawmill continue to improve the new sawmill primarily the large log processing line is not yet operatin g at planned production rates  primarily due to a current imbalance between smal l diameter and large diameter logs which impacts the mill s throughput 
in januar y and february  additional liquidity was needed at palco to fund workin g capital shortfalls and palco borrowed an additional million from mgi t o meet these shortfalls 
see note for information regarding the terms of th e palco revolving credit facility and the palco term loan 
palco will require additional funds in order to meet its working capita l and capital expenditure requirements for the next several years 
palco s abilit y to meet such requirements will be adversely affected should palco b e unsuccessful in its efforts to i meet planned production rates at the ne w sawmill  ii obtain waivers of default from its term and revolving credi t lenders  and iii obtain sufficient additional liquidity from the palco asse t sale program or from other sources 
furthermore  palco s cash flows fro m operations may be adversely affected by diminished availability of smaller log s from scopac or other third parties  lower lumber prices  adverse weathe r conditions  pending or future legal  legislative  regulatory and environmenta l matters  or continued increased funding requirements for its pension plan 
th e percentage of the logs purchased from third parties that palco uses in it s lumber operations is expected to increase 
under the master purchase agreement between palco and scopac master purchase agreement  palco is required to pa y for logs purchased from scopac by the th day of the following month  wherea s payment for logs purchased from third parties is generally due upon delivery accordingly  palco s working capital needs are likely to increase substantiall y during and beyond absent favorable regulatory action affecting scopac s thps

risk factors  and note  and general economi c conditions 
scopac s cash flows from operations are significantly impacted b y harvest volumes and log prices 
the master purchase agreement between scopac an d palco see item business forest products operations relationships among th e palco companies contemplates that all sales of logs by scopac to palco will b e at fair market value based on stumpage prices for each species and category o f timber 
the master purchase agreement provides that if the purchase price equal s or exceeds the sbe price and a structuring price set forth in a schedule t o the timber notes indenture  the purchase price is deemed to be at fair marke t value 
if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price  but is less tha n the structuring price  then scopac is required to engage an independent forestr y consultant to confirm that the purchase price reflects fair market value 
i n january  the state board of equalization adopted the new harvest valu e schedule for the first half of the prices published in that schedul e reflected a increase in the sbe price for small redwood logs and a decrease for small douglas fir logs from the prices published for the secon d half of scopac has conducted extensive reviews and analyses of its assets operations and future prospects 
as a result of these extensive reviews an d analyses  scopac s management has concluded that  in the absence of significan t regulatory relief and accommodations  scopac s future annual timber harves t levels and cash flows from operations will for at least the next several year s be substantially below both historical levels and the minimum levels necessar y in order to allow scopac to satisfy its debt service obligations in respect o f the timber notes 
scopac has announced that its projected average annual harves t level over the ten year period beginning is estimated to be approximatel y million board feet per year 
this harvest level reflects scopac management s estimate of the cumulative impact of ongoing regulatory limitations prescriptions  and other actions and is based upon a number of assumptions tha t may or may not prove to be accurate 
actual harvest levels may even be lower depending on the outcome of various assumptions 
during  scopac devoted significant management resources  and spen t approximately million  on efforts to restructure the timber note s consistent with management expectations as to future harvest levels and cas h flows 
these efforts were unsuccessful and have largely been abandoned 
th e company does not expect that scopac will be able to restructure its require d minimum payments on the timber notes through negotiations with holders of th e timber notes 
accordingly  additional liquidity will be needed to avoid an even t of default under the timber notes indenture 
on the january   timber notes payment date  scopac used fund s available under the scopac line of credit to fund the interest payment 
prior t o the july   timber notes payment date  scopac requested that palco mak e an early payment  equal to an expected million cash shortfall  in respec t of certain logs that had already been delivered to and purchased by palco fro m scopac 
palco approved and delivered the early log payment  which allowed scopa c to fund the july   cash shortfall and pay all of the interest due 
a s the january   timber notes payment date approached  it became apparen t that there would be a cash shortfall of million 
in january  scopa c and mgi consummated a lump sum sale and as such term is defined in the timbe r notes indenture of specified scopac timber 
in accordance with the timber note s indenture  the specified company timber was released from the liens securing th e timber notes and that timber was purchased by mgi 
the cash purchase price o f million paid in the lump sum sale  was calculated using the applicabl e prices established by the california state board of equalization for the firs t half of  and provided scopac the additional funds needed to pay all of th e interest due on the january   timber notes payment date 
scopac management estimates that its cash flows from operations  togethe r with the scopac line of credit will be insufficient  by a substantial amount  t o pay a substantial portion of the interest due on the july   timber note s payment date 
in an effort to address this expected shortfall  and future cas h shortfalls expected over at least the next several years  and avoid an event o f default under the timber notes indenture  scopac is seeking to sell certai n non timberland properties such as ranchlands and recreational areas  as well a s certain timberlands scopac land sale program 
there can be no assurance tha t these marketing efforts will be successful 
to the extent that scopac is unable to generate sufficient liquidity fro m the scopac land sale program or other sources  the company expects that scopa c will be forced to take extraordinary actions  which may include laying of f employees  shutting down various operations  and seeking protection by filin g under the bankruptcy code 
at december   the sar account balance was million includin g million of timber notes held in the sar account and million i n cash  all of which is restricted for future principal payments on the timbe r notes 
the sar account net cash balance of million is sufficient to cove r the scheduled amortization in  but will not be sufficient to cover th e scheduled amortization on the january   timber note payment date an d beyond 
accordingly  scopac s ability to make the scheduled amortizatio n payments on the timber notes beyond is dependent upon scopac s ability t o sell all or a portion of the timber notes held in the sar account 
no assuranc e can be given that scopac will be successful in its efforts to sell the timbe r notes held in the sar account before the january   timber notes paymen t date or as to the proceeds that might result from any such sale 
accordingly  scopac will require substantial additional funds in order t o meet its debt service requirements for the next year 
scopac s ability to mee t such requirements will be adversely affected a if scopac is unsuccessful i n its efforts to i generate sufficient cash flows from the scopac land sal e program  ii sell a portion of its timber notes holdings  or iii obtai n additional financing  or b if palco is unable to obtain sufficient additiona l liquidity to continue to purchase and pay for logs as they are purchased fro m scopac 
with respect to long term liquidity  until such time as scopac has adequat e cash flows from operations  there can be no assurance that scopac will be abl e to meet its working capital  capital expenditure and debt service obligations liquidity  capital resources  and results of operations in the long term ma y continue to be adversely affected by the same factors affecting short term cas h flows from operations  as discussed above

a hearing before a state administrative law judge to review both applications i s scheduled to begin on march  critical accounting policies and estimates this section contains statements which constitute forward lookin g statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see item business general  item a 
risk factors  and below for cautionary information with respect t o such forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition an d results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financia l statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle s generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of thes e consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates an d judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues an d expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumption s that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of thi s process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of asset s and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the compan y re evaluates its estimates and judgments on a regular  ongoing basis 
actua l results may differ from these estimates due to changed facts  circumstances an d conditions 
the following accounting policies and estimates are considered critical i n light of the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments an d uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on th e company s reported financial information 
principles of consolidation deconsolidation of kaiser under generally accepted accounting principles for entities consolidate d through voting interests  consolidation is generally required for investments o f more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except whe n control is not held by the majority owner 
under these rules  lega l reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclud e consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rathe r than the majority owner 
on february   kaiser and certain of it s subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a result  the company discontinued consolidating kaiser s financial result s beginning february   and began reporting its investment in kaiser usin g the cost method  under which the investment is reflected as a single amount o n the company s balance sheet of million and the recording of earnings o r losses from kaiser was discontinued after february  through february   under generally accepted principles o f consolidation  the company had recognized losses in excess of its investment i n kaiser of million 
since kaiser s results are no longer consolidated an d the company believes that it is not probable that it will be obligated to fun d losses related to its investment in kaiser  any adjustments reflected i n kaiser s financial statements subsequent to february  relating to th e recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classificatio n of liabilities or the effects on existing stockholders deficit  as well a s adjustments made to kaiser s financial information for loss contingencies an d other matters  are not expected to affect the company s financial results 
kaiser s plan of reorganization  which provides for the cancellation of th e company s  kaiser common shares without consideration or obligation was confirmed by the kaiser bankruptcy court in february however  kaiser s plan of reorganization is not yet final  as it must still be approved by th e us district court before kaiser can emerge from chapter  and is als o subject to appeal 
these consolidated financial statements do not reflect an y adjustment related to the deconsolidation of kaiser other than presenting th e company s investment in kaiser using the cost method 
the company expects t o reverse the million of losses in excess of its investment in kaiser  ne t of accumulated other comprehensive losses of million related to kaiser and recognize the net amount  including the related tax effects  in the perio d in which the kaiser shares are cancelled  currently expected to occur durin g upon effectiveness of kaiser s plan of reorganization  the company als o expects it will take a worthless stock deduction on its consolidated federa l income tax return related to the cancellation of the kaiser shares and will a t that time evaluate whether it expects to realize the resulting tax asset o f approximately million 
although the company does not currently expec t that it will be obligated to fund losses in kaiser  the amount of the reversa l would be reduced by any losses which the company later estimates it would b e obligated to fund 
gain and loss contingencies the company is involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceeding s discussed in note such matters involve uncertainty as to reasonably possibl e losses and gains the company may ultimately realize when one or more futur e events occur or fail to occur 
the company accrues and charges to incom e estimated losses including related estimated legal fees from contingencie s when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaire d or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
th e company recognizes gain contingencies when realization is assured 
difference s between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent period s are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  they are reflected in th e financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of gains and losses on lega l contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcome s from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlemen t initiatives  legislative and regulatory developments  and other factors 
fo r larger environmental matters  the company estimates the losses using estimate s prepared by third party experts and the advice of internal and external counsel risks and uncertainties are inherent with respect to the ultimate outcome o f litigation and environmental contingencies 
see note for further discussio n of the company s material contingencies 
income taxes the company accrues and charges to income estimated taxes when it i s probable at the balance sheet date that a liability has been incurred and th e amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  including situations i n which the company has and has not received tax assessments from the relevan t taxing authority 
taxes are provided in those instances where the compan y considers it probable that additional tax may be due in excess of amount s reflected in our tax returns as filed 
the company believes amounts currentl y provided for any such potential assessments will not be settled within the nex t twelve months and settlement of such amounts would not have a significant impac t on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and o r liquidity 
see note for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december   the company had million of deferred ta x assets net of million in valuation allowances and million o f deferred tax liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reported i n the company s balance sheet reflect the amount of taxes that the company ha s prepaid or for which it will receive a tax benefit an asset or will have t o pay in the future a liability because of temporary differences that resul t from differences in timing of revenue recognition or expense deductibilit y between generally accepted accounting principles and the internal revenue code accounting rules require that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuatio n allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely tha n not a likelihood of more than that all or some portion of the deferred ta x asset will not be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  bot h positive and negative  to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
th e need for a valuation allowance ultimately depends on the existence of sufficien t taxable income to realize the benefit of a future deductible amount 
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred ta x assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expecte d for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmenta l complexity of the determination 
projections of future taxable income  by thei r very nature  require estimates and judgments about future events that  althoug h they might conceivably be predictable  are far less certain than events tha t have already occurred and can be objectively measured 
uncertainties that might exist with respect to the realization of th e company s deferred tax assets relate to future taxable income 
see note fo r further discussion of the company s valuation allowances on deferred tax assets pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses estimating future benefit payments for purposes of measuring pensio n benefit obligations requires the company to make a number of assumptions abou t future experience 
these assumptions are combined with the terms of th e company s plans to produce an estimate of required future benefit payments which is discounted to reflect the time value of money 
as a result  assumption s about the covered population demographic assumptions and about the economi c environment economic assumptions significantly affect pension and othe r postretirement benefit obligations 
the most significant demographic assumption s are expected retirement age  life expectancy  and turnover  while the ke y economic assumptions are the discount rate  the salary growth rate  and th e expected return on plan assets 
at december   the maxxam pension pla n and the palco retirement plan were frozen 
as a result  these plans wil l continue  but no additional benefits will accrue to participants subsequent t o december  future benefit payments will continue to be measured based o n the same types of demographic and economic assumptions  with the exception o f salary growth as no new benefits will be accrued 
the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans and th e accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the company s othe r postretirement benefit plans was determined using a discount rate of a t december   and at december  as the pension plans wer e frozen december   there is no assumed weighted average long term rate o f compensation 
the assumed weighted average long term rate of return on pla n assets is 
plan assets consist principally of common stocks and u 
s government and other fixed income obligations 
the estimated impact of a decrease in the discount rate from t o would increase the company s aggregate pension obligation b y approximately million  while the estimated impact of a increase in th e discount rate from to would decrease the company s aggregat e pension obligation by approximately million 
generally accepted accounting principles are applied to determine th e expense that the company recognizes related to pension obligations  whil e pension plan funding is governed by tax and labor laws 
the company expect s pension expense to be approximately million in  while cas h contributions are expected to be approximately million in thi s compared to pension expense of million and cash contributions of million in at december   the company had million in accrued liabilitie s related to pension benefits 
this amount consists of an accrued liability o f million reflecting the cumulative excess of the amount the company ha s expensed over the amount the company has funded since inception of its plans  a s well as an additional minimum liability of million reflecting the exces s of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets 
see note for further discussion of the company s obligations related t o pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
impairment of noncurrent assets the company reviews noncurrent assets for impairment when circumstance s indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment is indicated if the total undiscounted future cash flows expected t o result from use of the assets  including the possible residual value associate d with their eventual disposition  are less than the carrying amount of th e assets 
assets are written down to fair value and a loss is recognized upo n impairment 
fair value increases on assets previously written down fo r impairment losses are not recognized 
considerable judgment is exercised in the company s assessment of the nee d for an impairment write down 
indicators of impairment must be present 
th e estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumption s and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
in some instances situations might exist where impairments are the result of changes in economi c conditions or other factors that develop over time  which increases th e subjectivity of assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimate s used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long live d assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
a probability weighted approac h is used for situations in which alternative courses of action to recover th e carrying amount of long lived assets are under consideration or a range i s estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
as part of palco s on going evaluation of activities in  several site s were subject to an impairment review due to changes in their expected use 
as a result of the impairment review  two facilities  the carlotta mill and th e scotia remanufacturing facility  were deemed impaired and an impairment charg e of million  was recognized in new accounting standards see note for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and thei r potential impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily under th e scopac line of credit and the palco term loan and palco revolving credi t facility  as well as certain other debt facilities used to finance real estat e development activities 
these facilities bear interest at either the prim e interest rate or libor  plus specified percentage point spreads 
the company s objective in maintaining its other variable rate borrowings is flexibility i n borrowing funds and making repayments without penalties
