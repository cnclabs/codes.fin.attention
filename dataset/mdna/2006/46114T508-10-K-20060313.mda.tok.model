item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview incorporated in march  we provide enterprise content management software and services that enable businesses to create  review  manage  distribute and archive critical business content  such as documents  spreadsheets  e mails and presentations  as well as web images  graphics  content and applications code across the enterprise and its value chain of customers  partners and suppliers 
our industry specific solutions enable organizations to unify people  content and processes to minimize business risk  accelerate time to value and sustain lower total cost of ownership 
interwoven s customers have deployed our products for business initiatives such as improving customer experience  streamlining information technology processes  enabling greater compliance and more 
to date  more than  enterprises and professional services organizations worldwide have licensed our software solutions and products 
we market and license our software products and services primarily through a direct sales force and augment our sales  marketing and service efforts through relationships with technology vendors  professional service firms  systems integrators and other strategic partners 
our revenues to date have been derived primarily from customers in north america  revenues from outside united states of america accounted for of our total revenues in we had employees as of december  in august  we acquired scrittura  a provider of document automation software for the non exchange based trading operations of financial services companies 
in august  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of software intelligence 
in november  we completed our merger with imanage and  in june  we completed the acquisition of mediabin 
the results of operations of these business combinations have been included prospectively from the closing dates of these transactions 
accordingly  our financial results are not directly comparable to those of the previous periods 

table of contents results of operations prior to  our revenues were primarily derived from our web content management product  teamsite 
revenues from teamsite have been affected since mid by a shift away from spending on public facing web applications to spending on internal productivity applications and other software applications 
in response to these challenges  we completed a series of strategic actions designed to expand our product offerings into the ecm market and create product offerings that we believe address a larger market opportunity 
during  we acquired mediabin and imanage to extend our product offerings into digital asset management and collaborative document management 
these business combinations also allowed us to achieve greater economies of scale in our sales  marketing  development and administrative functions 
we also completed a series of restructuring actions to help align our cost structure with expected revenues 
these restructuring actions included staff reductions in all functional areas of our business  decreases in marketing and promotional spending and the abandonment of certain facilities in excess of current and expected future needs 
the ecm market is fragmented and intensely competitive and growth in the ecm market has been sporadic as customers tightly manage their information technology budgets and priorities 
our consolidated results of operations have been impacted in recent periods by long product evaluation periods  protracted contract negotiations and multiple authorization requirements of our customers 
while we have taken steps to mitigate the effects of these forces  we expect that our consolidated results of operations will continue to be affected by these factors for the foreseeable future 
revenues years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages license percentage of total revenues support and service percentage of total revenues total revenues increased from million in to million in we believe that the increase in total revenues was due primarily to an increase in customer support revenues from our larger installed base of customers purchasing support contacts and  to a lesser degree  an increase in consulting revenues 
total revenues increased from million in to million in we believe this increase was primarily attributable to sales of the worksite product  which we acquired in november as part of our merger with imanage  and the digital asset management products  which we acquired in june as part of our acquisition of mediabin 
sales outside of the united states of america represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect that many of our prospects and customers will continue to be cautious in their information technology spending initiatives in and that our sales cycle and revenues will be affected by this trend 
license 
license revenues increased from million in to million in we believe that the slight increase in license revenues for over was attributable to sales of newly introduced software solutions offset primarily by reduced license revenues from our european operations 
license revenues increased from million in to million in we believe this increase was primarily attributable to license revenues from the worksite product that we acquired in november and the digital asset management products that we acquired in june our average license transaction size for sales in excess of  was   and  in  and  respectively 
in  and  we had four  three and two  respectively  individual license transaction in excess of million 
license revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
support and service 
support and service revenues increased from million in to million in we believe this increase was primarily due to higher support revenue from our larger installed base of customers purchasing support contracts and  to a lesser extent  higher consulting revenues 
support and service revenues increased from million in to million in we believe this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of imanage and mediabin  which provided a greater opportunity for consulting services and a larger installed base of customers purchasing support services 

table of contents to the extent that our license revenues decline in the future  our support and service revenues may also decline 
specifically  a decline in license revenues may result in fewer consulting engagements 
additionally  since customer support contracts are generally sold with each license transaction  a decline in license revenues may also result in a slowing of customer support revenues 
however  since customer support revenues are recognized over the duration of the support contract  the impact will not be experienced for up to several months after a decline in license revenues 
in the future  customer support revenues may also be adversely impacted if customers fail to renew their support agreements or reduce the license software quantity under their support agreements 
cost of revenues years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages cost of license revenues percentage of license revenues percentage of total revenues cost of support and service revenues percentage of support and service revenues percentage of total revenues license 
cost of license revenues includes expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and documentation  as well as costs of licensing third party software embedded in or sold with our software products and amortization of purchased technology associated with business combinations 
cost of license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from to was mainly due to the million increase in amortization of purchased technology associated with our business combinations 
similarly  the increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from to was also mainly due to the million increase in amortization of purchased technology associated with our business combinations 
based solely on acquisitions completed through the year ended december  and assuming no impairments  we expect the amortization of purchased technology classified as a cost of license revenues to be million in  million in  million in and  in we expect cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to vary from period to period depending on the mix of software products sold  the extent to which third party software products are bundled with our products and the amount of overall license revenues  as many of the third party software products embedded with our software are under fixed fee arrangements 
support and service 
cost of support and service revenues consists of salary and personnel related expenses for our consulting  training and support personnel  costs associated with delivering product updates to customers under active support contracts  subcontractor expenses and depreciation of equipment used in our services and customer support operation 
cost of support and services increased million or to million in from million in the increase in cost of support and services was due to higher personnel costs of million primarily as a result of the acquisition of scrittura and higher travel expenses of million 
cost of support and service revenues increased million or to million in from million in the increase in cost of support and service revenues from to was due to higher subcontractor costs of million and higher personnel costs of million primarily as a result of the acquisitions of imanage and mediabin 
cost of support and service revenues represented  and of support and service revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of related revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in support revenues as a percentage of total support and service revenues  as support revenues generally have higher gross margins than consulting services and training 
support and service headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 

table of contents we realize lower gross profits on support and service revenues than on license revenues 
in addition  we may contract with outside consultants and system integrators to supplement the services we provide to customers  which increases our costs and further reduces gross profits 
as a result  if support and service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues or if we increase our use of third parties to provide such services  our gross profits will be lower and our operating results may be adversely affected 
operating expenses sales and marketing years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  benefits and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel and marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or from million in to million in the decline in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a  decrease in personnel costs due to lower average headcount during the year and a  decrease in depreciation expense  partially offset by an  increase in marketing and advertising expenses due to sales promotion activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to million in higher commissions as a result of higher revenues  million increase in personnel costs and million in increased promotional expenses 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses represented  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues from to was due primarily to cost control efforts while the decrease from to was due primarily to economies of scale associated with our business combinations 
sales and marketing headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of hiring of new sales and marketing personnel  our spending on marketing programs and the level of revenues  in particular license revenues  in each period 
research and development years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages research and development percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  third party contractors  facilities and related overhead costs associated with our product development and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses increased  or from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs including salary increases and benefit costs partially offset by a  decrease in rent expenses 
research and development expenses increased million or from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs of million  a million increase in facilities expense and a  increase in third party contractor costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
research and development headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
we expect research and development expenses in will decline slightly as a percentage of total revenues when compared to as we continue to manage our expenses and realize greater cost efficiencies in our product development activities 

table of contents general and administrative years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages general and administrative percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for general corporate functions including finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to a  increase in personnel expenses associated with salary increases and benefit costs and a  increase in legal  accounting and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs partially offset by higher facilities costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expense was in and and in the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues from to was due primarily to cost savings synergies associated with our business combinations and cost control efforts 
general and administrative headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
in  we currently expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses of up to million associated with the retirement of our chief executive officer  who announced his retirement on january   and costs associated with recruiting a replacement 
amortization of stock based compensation years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages amortization of stock based compensation percentage of total revenues we recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with our business combinations and when the exercise price of stock options granted was lower than the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
amortization of stock based compensation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in amortization of stock based compensation in from was primarily due to the use of the accelerated method of amortizing deferred stock based compensation expense  as prescribed by financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which has resulted in greater recognition of amortization expense in the beginning of the vesting period for such stock options 
the increased amortization of stock based compensation in from was due to the assumption of stock options in the merger with imanage 
amortization of stock based compensation related to the following expense categories in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for  and  respectively in thousands years ended december  cost of support and service revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in december  we issued options to our chief executive officer to purchase  shares of common stock  at an exercise price of per share  which was below the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for the difference 
table of contents between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
this deferred stock based compensation was being amortized to expense over the four year vesting period of the stock options using an accelerated approach consistent with the method described in fin no 
on october   the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of approximately million out of the money unvested common stock options with exercise prices of and above 
as a result of this acceleration of vesting  the unamortized stock based compensation related to the options granted to our chief executive officer of  was expensed in the consolidated statement of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
and its related implementation guidance 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
r 
as we have million unvested common stock options outstanding at december   we expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
amortization of intangible assets years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages amortization of intangible assets percentage of total revenues amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and consists of amortization expense related to customer lists and assembled workforce assets recorded in our business combinations 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets from to was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized offset to a lesser degree by the acquisition of scrittura in  while the increase in amortization of intangible assets from to was primarily the result of our merger with imanage in november based on business combinations completed through december   we expect amortization of intangible assets to be million in  million in and  in we may incur additional amortization expense beyond these expected future levels to the extent we make additional acquisitions 
in process research and development years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages in process research and development percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful in  in conjunction with our business combinations  we recorded in process research and development charges of  related to the acquisition of mediabin and million related to the merger with imanage 
these in process research and development charges were associated with software development efforts in process at the time of the business combinations that had not yet achieved technological feasibility and no future alternative uses had been identified 
the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was determined  in part  by a third party appraiser through established valuation techniques 
we may incur in process research and development expense in the future to the extent we make additional acquisitions 
the software development efforts in process at the time of the imanage and mediabin acquisitions were either completed  discontinued or were integrated with other interwoven products in 
table of contents restructuring and excess facilities charges recoveries years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages restructuring and excess facilities charges recoveries percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful during  we implemented restructuring plans in connection with our business combinations and to better align our expenses with anticipated revenues 
additionally  we performed an evaluation of our facilities requirements and re evaluated previously recorded excess facilities accruals 
as a result  we recorded charges of million associated with workforce reductions and million associated with the abandonment of excess facilities 
in addition  we further revised our estimates of future sublease income for facilities previously abandoned and recorded an additional million in charges as a result of changes in our estimates 
in  we entered into agreements to terminate excess facilities in chicago  illinois and sunnyvale  california  revised our sublease assumptions associated with certain excess facilities and restructured certain of our european operations and our professional services organization 
as a result of these actions  we recorded charges of million associated with excess facilities and million related to workforce reductions  which included the termination of employees 
in  we reversed  of the previously recorded restructuring accrual as a result of subleasing an excess facility in mountain view  california  which sublease was not previously anticipated or considered probable 
we also resolved several outstanding matters associated with the termination of certain european employees in and  as a result  we reversed  of the previously recorded restructuring accrual related to expected settlement costs 
further  we revised our estimates of certain sublease assumptions and lease exit costs and reversed  of previously recorded excess facilities accrual 
restructuring and excess facilities charges in includes  associated with the accretion of discounted future lease payments associated with facilities leases recorded under sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the charges recorded for excess facilities were based on the payments due over the remainder of the lease term and estimated operating costs offset by our estimate of future sublease income 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities costs may differ from actual results and such differences may result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
interest income and other  net years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages interest income and other  net percentage of total revenues interest income and other is composed of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and  to a lesser degree  interest expense 
interest income and other was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income and other increased million  or from million in to million in this increase was due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments 
interest income and other decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due to lower interest rates on our cash and investments and a lower average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments 

table of contents provision for income taxes years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes percentage of total revenues the provision for income taxes recorded in  and related principally to state and foreign taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income and will begin to expire in through and through management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and recognizes the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that these assets are realizable 
currently  it is determined that it is not likely that the assets will be realized 
therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred income tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our primary sources of cash are the collection of accounts receivable from our customers  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional services and facilities and related costs 
we also used cash to purchase property and equipment  pay liabilities for excess facilities and to acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings 
a number of non cash items were charged to expense in  and these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets  in process research and development and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
these items decreased our net income in and increased our net loss in and although these non cash items may increase or decrease in amount and therefore cause an associated increase or decrease in our future operating results  these items will have no corresponding impact on our operating cash flows 
cash provided by operating activities in was million  representing an improvement of million from this change was primarily the result of improved operating results  after adjusting for non cash expense  and lower payments to reduce our restructuring and excess facilities accrual offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
payments made to reduce our excess facilities obligations totaled million 
our days outstanding in accounts receivable days outstanding are days at december  and deferred revenues increased primarily due to increased customer support contracts 
cash used in operating activities in was million  representing an improvement of million from this improvement primarily resulted from a smaller operating loss  after adjusting for non cash expenses  cash collections against accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenues offset by higher payments to reduce our restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
payments made to reduce our excess facilities obligations totaled million and included scheduled lease payments on excess facilities and cash paid to terminate a portion of our headquarters lease and a lease in chicago  illinois 
our days outstanding decreased from days at december  to days at december  days outstanding at december  were primarily impacted by the acquisition of accounts receivable from imanage and an increase in customer support billings resulting from our merger with imanage  which added to our outstanding accounts receivable 
deferred revenues increased primarily due to increased customer support contracts 

table of contents cash used in operating activities in was million  primarily due to our net loss  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  an increase in accounts receivable  offset by increases in deferred revenues and restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
deferred revenues increased due to increased customer support contracts in large part resulting from the imanage merger 
the increase in the restructuring and excess facilities accrual resulted from the abandonment of properties associated with the imanage merger and the re evaluation of sublease prospects for certain excess facilities 
cash provided by investing activities in was million  representing an improvement of million from this improvement primarily resulted from higher net proceeds from maturities and sale of short term investments offset by million in cash used to acquire scrittura 
cash used in investing activities in was million in comparison with cash provided in of million 
the change occurred primarily due to utilization of cash to acquire short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the improvement over years was primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment as necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
we may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions 
we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds is difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and general market conditions 
bank borrowings 
we have a million line of credit available to us at december   which is secured by cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the line of credit bears interest at the lower of below the bank s prime rate adjusted from time to time or a fixed rate of above the libor in effect on the first day of the term 
there are no financial covenant requirements under our line of credit 
the line of credit agreement expires in july and is primarily used as collateral for letters of credit required by our facilities leases 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit as of december  we expect to renew or replace this line of credit agreement in in connection with the imanage merger  we assumed a term loan with a bank secured by certain of our property and equipment 
the term loan was paid in full in december facilities 
we lease facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through as of december   minimum cash payments due under operating lease obligations totaled million

we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements or with the input of independent real estate consultants and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require that a significant amount of the remaining future lease payments be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment could materially affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
we have entered into various standby letter of credit agreements associated with our facilities leases  which serve as required security deposits for such facilities 
these letters of credit expire at various times through at december   we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  which are secured by cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the following presents the outstanding commitments under these agreements at each respective balance sheet date for the next five years and at balance sheet dates after in thousands standby letters of years ending december  credit after we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with our existing line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding at any time 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents financial risk management as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
our primary exposures relate to non united states dollar denominated revenues and operating expenses in europe  asia  australia and canada 
we use foreign currency forward contracts as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
gains and losses on the changes in the fair values of the forward contracts are included in interest income and other  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not anticipate significant currency gains or losses in the near term 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases for most united states and international offices in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are often referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing

future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of december  are detailed previously in liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future consolidated results of operations 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  loss from operations and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating the accrual for restructuring and excess facilities costs

revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the license of our software products and from support  consulting and training services that we provide to our customers 
we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  for agreements that have multiple deliverables or multiple element arrangements eg  software products  services  support  etc  revenue is recognized for delivered elements only where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements 
our specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price of the element when sold separately 
once we have established the fair value of each of the undelivered elements  the dollar value of the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements first and the residual of the dollar value of the arrangement is then allocated to the delivered elements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of undelivered elements eg  support  consulting and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and the arrangement does not require additional services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
at the outset of our customer arrangements  if we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with each transaction 
if a portion of the license fee is due beyond our normal payments terms  which generally does not exceed days from the invoice date  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we determine collectibility on a case by case basis  following analysis of the general payment history within the geographic sales region and a customer s years of operation  payment history and credit profile 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our review process  we recognize revenue as payments are received 
we periodically review collection patterns from our geographic locations to ensure historical collection results provide a reasonable basis for revenue recognition upon signing of an arrangement 
we determined that we had sufficient evidence in the first quarter of from customers in japan and singapore to begin recognizing revenue on an accrual basis and  in the third quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from customers in spain on an accrual basis 
previously  revenues had been recognized from customers in those countries only when cash was received and all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
support and service revenues consist of professional services and support fees 
professional services consist of software installation and integration  training and business process consulting 
professional services are predominantly billed on a time and materials basis and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
support contracts are typically priced as a percentage of the product license fee and generally have a one year term 
services provided to customers under support contracts include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades 
revenues from advanced payments for support contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically one year 
in  we applied sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  to account for a software arrangement which included services that constitute significant production  modification or customization of our software 
as we were not in a position to make dependable cost estimates as to completion  the completed contract method of accounting was applied and revenues were recognized upon contract completion 
for classification purposes in our consolidated statement of operations  we 
table of contents include the amount representing vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the service revenues as service revenues and the residual portion of the total fee as license revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for accounts receivable considered uncollectible 
management specifically analyzes its accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in general  our allowance for doubtful accounts consists of specific accounts where we believe collection is not probable and a rate based on our historical experience which is applied to accounts receivable not specifically reserved 
at december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  and  respectively 
these amounts represent of total accounts receivable at december  and the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the continued improvement of our aged accounts receivable profile 
allowance for sales returns 
from time to time  a customer may return to us some or all of the software purchased 
while our software and reseller agreements generally do not provide for a specific right of return  we may accept product returns in certain circumstances 
to date  sales returns have been infrequent and not significant in relation to our total revenues 
we make an estimate of our expected returns and provide an allowance for sales returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
in determining the amount of the allowance required  management specifically analyzes our revenue transactions  customer software installation patterns  historical return pattern  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
at december  and  our allowance for sales returns was  and  respectively 
restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
in order to better align our cost structure with our revenues  we implemented a series of restructuring and facility consolidation plans 
restructuring and facilities consolidation costs consist of expenses associated with workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities and the impairment of leasehold improvements and other equipment associated with abandoned facilities 
we accrue for severance payments and other related termination benefits provided to employees in connection with involuntary staff reductions 
we accrue for these benefits in the period when benefits are communicated to the terminated employees 
typically  terminated employees are not required to provide continued service to receive termination benefits 
if continued service is required  then the severance liability is accrued over the required service period 
in general  we use a formula based on a combination of the number of years of service and the employee s position within our organization to calculate the termination benefits to be provided to affected employees 
at december    was accrued for future severance and termination benefits payments 
in connection with our restructuring and facility consolidation plans  we perform evaluations of our then current facilities requirements and identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when a facility is identified as excess and we have ceased use of the facility  we accrue the fair value of the lease obligations 
in determining fair value of expected sublease income over the remainder of the lease term and of related exit costs  if any  we receive appraisals from real estate brokers to aid in our estimate 
in addition  during the evaluation of our facilities requirements  we also identify operating equipment and leasehold improvements that may be impaired 
excluding the facilities that are currently subleased  our excess facilities are being marketed for sublease and are currently unoccupied 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities could differ from actual results and such differences could require additional charges or credits that could materially affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the restructuring and excess facilities accrual at december  includes minimum lease payments of million and estimated operating expenses of million offset by estimated sublease income of million and the present value discount of  recorded in accordance with sfas no 
we reassess our excess facilities liability each period based on current real estate market conditions 
accounting for stock based compensation 
through december  we accounted for compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we did not record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based 
table of contents compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r generally requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
this standard is effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after june  we are required to adopt this new standard on january  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  consisting principally of certain net operating losses carried forward 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this allocation derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge shall be recognized for the excess 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
we performed and completed our required annual impairment testing in the third quarter of upon completing our review  we determined that the carrying value of our recorded goodwill had not been impaired and no impairment charge was recorded 
although we determined in that our recorded goodwill had not been impaired  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance may result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we are also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill may be impaired based on the factors mentioned above 
for example  if our market capitalization declines below our net book value or we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price  we will assess whether our goodwill has been impaired 
a significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and operating results 
we account for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability 
table of contents of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we do not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the following table reflects the expected future amortization of intangible assets  assuming no future impairments in thousands amortization amortization of intangible of purchased years ending december  assets technology total intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over estimated useful lives of between and months 
the amortization expense related to the intangible assets may be accelerated in the future if we reduce the estimated useful life of the intangible assets

interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
we invest in high quality credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the short term interest bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities three months or greater are available for sale and are considered to be
