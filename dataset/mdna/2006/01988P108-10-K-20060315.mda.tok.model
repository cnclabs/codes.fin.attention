risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this report and documents incorporated and deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business operations 
if any of these risks or uncertainties occurs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our business if physicians and hospitals do not accept our products and services  or delay in deciding whether to purchase our products and services  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
our business model depends on our ability to sell our products and services 
acceptance of our products and services requires physicians and hospitals to adopt different behavior patterns and new methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
we cannot assure you that physicians and hospitals will integrate our products and services into their workflow or that participants in the healthcare market will accept our products and services as a replacement for traditional methods of conducting healthcare transactions 
achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial sales and marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry 
if we fail to achieve broad acceptance of our products and services by physicians  hospitals and other healthcare industry participants or if we fail to position our services as a preferred method for information management and pharmaceutical healthcare delivery  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to successfully integrate businesses we acquire  our ability to expand our product and service offerings and our customer base may be limited 
in order to expand our product and service offerings and grow our business by reaching new customers  we may continue to acquire businesses that we believe are complementary 
the successful integration of acquired 
table of contents businesses  including a  is critical to our success 
such acquisitions  including the a acquisition  involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees and our inability to maintain the goodwill of the acquired businesses 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to these acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses 
the successful implementation of our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire companies on acceptable terms  integrate their operations and technology successfully with our own and maintain the goodwill of the acquired business 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
moreover  in pursuing acquisition opportunities  we may compete for acquisition targets with other companies with similar growth strategies 
some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have 
competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets 
our business will be harmed if we cannot maintain our strategic alliance agreement and the cross license agreement with idx or if we are unable to enter into and maintain relationships with idx customers 
in  we entered into a year strategic alliance agreement with idx pursuant to which we and idx agreed to coordinate product development and align our respective marketing processes 
under this agreement  idx had granted us the exclusive right to market  sell  license and distribute ambulatory point of care and clinical ehr solutions to idx customers 
on january   idx was acquired by ge and on january   we  idx and ge amended and restated our strategic alliance agreement 
under this amended agreement  the exclusivity provisions of the original agreement were modified such that  in addition to our solutions  ge may market its centricity electronic health record ambulatory solution to idx customers 
after july   these exclusivity provisions will terminate and idx may  but will not be required to  market our solutions to its customers 
further  under the original agreement  we were restricted from providing practice management systems 
the amended agreement eliminates these restrictions  except that if we acquire a practice management system  we may not market or provide such system to the existing idx customer base until july  therefore  we are unable to market the practice management system acquired in the recent a acquisition to idx customers until after that date 
we have historically generated a significant portion of our bookings from idx customers 
in that regard  approximately and of touchworks bookings for the years ended december  and  respectively  were from sales to members of idx s customer base 
if we are unable to compete effectively against the centricity product or are otherwise unable to maintain sales to idx customers at the levels we have historically experienced  our revenues may decrease and our results of operations may be harmed 
additionally  if certain competitors of idx or ge acquire us prior to july   the above described restrictions on idx s ability to market products competitive to our products will terminate 
under the amended agreement  we and idx will continue to cooperate with respect to installation and implementation of one another s products for common idx and allscripts customers and in the provision of customer support services to ensure that such products remain interoperable 
if the amended agreement is terminated for any reason  or if idx and ge were to fail to fulfill their obligations under the amended agreement  we would lose the benefits of the amended agreement  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also have a cross license and software maintenance agreement with idx pursuant to which we granted idx a non exclusive  non cancelable and non terminable license to use  market and sublicense certain of our software combined with idx products  and idx granted us a non exclusive  non cancelable and non terminable license to use  market and sublicense certain idx software for use with our products 
if the amended agreement is terminated  we will not have access to certain idx software  harming our ability to integrate our services with idx systems and provide real time data synchronization 
this may make our systems less desirable to idx customers and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents it is difficult to predict the sales cycle for our healthcare software solutions and physician education services 
the duration of the sales cycle for our healthcare software solutions and physician education services depends on a number of factors  including the nature and size of the potential customer and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer  and is difficult to predict 
our sales and marketing efforts with respect to hospitals and large healthcare organizations generally involve a lengthy sales cycle due to these organizations complex decision making processes 
additionally  in light of increased government involvement in healthcare  and related changes in the operating environment for healthcare organizations  our current and potential customers may react by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our services 
if potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to purchase our solutions  our selling expenses could increase and our revenues could decrease  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition for our employees is intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 
our ability to provide high quality services to our clients depends in large part upon our employees experience and expertise 
we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel with a deep understanding of the healthcare and healthcare information technology industries 
we compete with a number of companies for experienced personnel and many of these companies  including clients and competitors  have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment 
in addition  we invest significant time and expense in training our employees  which increases their value to clients and competitors who may seek to recruit them and increases the costs of replacing them 
if we fail to retain our employees  the quality of our services could diminish and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  we may be unable to replace them  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our success largely depends on the continued skills  experience  efforts and policies of our management and other key personnel and our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in particular  the services of glen e 
tullman  our chairman and chief executive officer  are integral to the execution of our business strategy 
if one or more of our key employees leaves our employment  we will have to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our strategy 
because competition for skilled employees is intense  and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive  we believe that the loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to retain such personnel 
we do not maintain keyman insurance for any of our key employees 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or services or fail to keep pace with advances in technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products on schedule  or at all  or that such products will achieve market acceptance 
moreover  competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our results of operations 
a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products and services may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
because the internet and healthcare information markets are characterized by rapid technological change  we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to 
table of contents continue to enhance our existing products and services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards  and  as a result  our business could suffer 
because our business model has changed in recent years  our operating history is not indicative of our future performance  and our business is difficult to evaluate 
because our business model has changed and evolved in recent years  we do not have an extensive operating history upon which you can evaluate our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in implementing our business model  we significantly changed our business operations  sales and implementation practices  customer service and support operations and management focus 
we also face new risks and challenges  including a lack of meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan future budgets and the need to develop strategic relationships and pursue other strategic opportunities 
in addition  as a result of the a acquisition on march   we face other risks related to our business model described below  including the risks described under risks related to the acquisition 
our business depends in part on and will continue to depend in part on our ability to establish and maintain additional strategic relationships 
to be successful  we must continue to maintain our existing strategic relationships and establish additional strategic relationships with leaders in a number of healthcare and healthcare information technology industry segments 
this is critical to our success because we believe that these relationships contribute towards our ability to extend the reach of our products and services to a larger number of physicians and hospitals and to other participants in the healthcare industry  develop and deploy new products and services  further enhance the allscripts brand  and generate additional revenue and cash flows 
entering into strategic relationships is complicated because strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or establish relationships with key participants in the healthcare industry if we conduct business with their competitors 
we depend  in part  on our strategic partners ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services 
if we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of indebtedness and increased amortization expense 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  all of which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have taken  and  if an impairment occurs  could take  charges against earnings in connection with acquisitions 
in connection with the a acquisition  we expect to incur a restructuring charge of approximately to million  however  the actual charge may be greater than this amount 

table of contents if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems  our business could suffer 
complex software such as ours often contains undetected defects or errors 
it is possible that such errors may be found after introduction of new software or enhancements to existing software 
we continually introduce new solutions and enhancements to our solutions  and  despite testing by us  it is possible that errors might occur in our software 
if we detect any errors before we introduce a solution  we might have to delay deployment for an extended period of time while we address the problem 
if we do not discover software errors that affect our new or current solutions or enhancements until after they are deployed  we would need to provide enhancements to correct such errors 
errors in our software could result in harm to our reputation  lost sales  delays in commercial release  product liability claims  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our solutions  license terminations or renegotiations  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
furthermore  our customers might use our software together with products from other companies 
as a result  when problems occur  it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
even when our software does not cause these problems  the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs  divert the attention of our technical personnel from our solution development efforts  impact our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems 
our future success depends upon our ability to grow  and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
we will need to expand our operations if we successfully achieve market acceptance for our products and services 
we cannot be certain that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases 
difficulties in managing any future growth could have a significant negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations because we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
we have experienced losses in the past and we may not remain profitable in the future 
we generated net income of approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we generated net losses of approximately million and approximately million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we cannot be certain that we will generate sufficient revenues to maintain profitability in any future periods 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
our failure to compete successfully could cause our revenue or market share to decline 
the market for our products and services is fragmented  intensely competitive and is characterized by rapidly evolving industry standards  technology and user needs and the frequent introduction of new products and 
table of contents services 
some of our competitors may be more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
moreover  we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries 
if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with one of our competitors  the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
we compete on the basis of several factors  including breadth and depth of services  reputation  reliability  accuracy and security  client service  price  and industry expertise and experience 
our clinical solutions group s principal competitors include cerner corporation  eclinicalworks inc  emdeon corporation  formerly known as webmd corporation  epic systems corporation  ge  imedica corporation  mckesson corporation  medhost  inc  misys healthcare systems  picis inc  quality systems  inc and wellsoft corporation 
a also competes with certain of these entities 
we also face competition from providers of practice management solutions  ambulatory and acute ehr solutions  and enterprise wide application solutions 
our physicians interactive group s principal competitors include aptilon inc  dendrite international  inc  emdeon corporation  lathian systems  inc  medsite  inc  quintiles transnational corp 
and ventiv health  inc we also face competition from clinical information and education providers  such as disease state management companies  full service e marketing companies  companies who provide electronic detailing software  and the in house efforts of our clients  including health plans  pharmacy benefit managers  and pharmaceutical companies 
our medication services group s principal competitors include cardinal health  inc  drx a wholly owned subsidiary of purkinje  inc  mckesson corporation  pd rx pharmaceuticals  inc  pharmapac  physicians total care  inc  southwood pharmaceuticals  inc 
and various other regional distributors 
we also face competition from providers of other medication repackaging service and bulk pharmaceutical distributors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures that we face will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our competitive position may suffer 
our business plan is predicated on our proprietary systems and technology and physician education products 
accordingly  protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position 
we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of trademark  trade secret and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures 
we generally do not have any patents on our technology 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position 
in addition  we may have to engage in litigation in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of invalidity  and we may incur substantial costs and the diversion of management s time and attention as a result 

table of contents if we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our applications functionality overlaps with competitive products 
while we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties  we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
factors beyond our control could cause interruptions in our operations  which would adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to succeed  we must be able to operate our systems without interruption 
certain of our communications and information services are provided through our third party service providers 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by damage from a variety of sources  many of which are not within our control  including without limitation power loss and telecommunications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and fire  flood and other natural disasters 
any significant interruptions in our services would damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable for use of data we provide 
we provide data for use by healthcare providers in treating patients 
third party contractors provide us with most of this data 
if this data is incorrect or incomplete  adverse consequences  including death  may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us 
in addition  certain of our solutions provide applications that relate to patient clinical information  and a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly  including through licensed practitioners  or delivery of information by a third party site that a consumer accesses through our websites  exposes us to personal injury liability  or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information 
while we maintain product liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business  we cannot assure you that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a claim brought against us that is uninsured or under insured could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources 
if our security is breached  we could be subject to liability  and customers could be deterred from using our services 
the difficulty of securely transmitting confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to engaging in sensitive communications over the internet 
our business relies on using the internet to transmit confidential information 
we believe that any well publicized compromise of internet security may deter people from using the internet for these purposes and from using our system to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential healthcare information 
it is also possible that third parties could penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate patient information and other data 
if this happens  our operations could be interrupted  and we could be subject to liability and regulatory action 
we may need to devote significant financial and other resources to protect against 
table of contents security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
we could face financial loss  litigation and other liabilities to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of confidential information like patient records or credit information 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future needs  our ability to respond to competitive pressures may be impaired and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of potential acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if our content and service providers fail to perform adequately  our reputation in the marketplace and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on independent content and service providers for many of the benefits we provide through our clinical software and our physician education applications and services  including the maintenance of managed care pharmacy guidelines  drug interaction reviews and the routing of transaction data to third party payers 
if our services are interrupted as a result of any problems with our providers  our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have no means of replacing content or services on a timely basis or at all if they are inadequate or in the event of a service interruption or failure 
we also rely on independent content providers for the majority of the clinical  educational and other healthcare information that we provide 
in addition  we depend on our content providers to deliver high quality content from reliable sources and to continually upgrade their content in response to demand and evolving healthcare industry trends 
if these parties fail to develop and maintain high quality  attractive content  the value of our brand and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be impaired 
if we are forced to reduce our prices for prepackaged medications  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales of prepackaged medications to physicians 
we may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales of prepackaged medications arising from various sources  including practices of managed care organizations  internet pharmacies  including those operating in canada and other countries outside the united states  and government action affecting pharmaceutical reimbursement under medicare 
our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship are affected by changes in regulations and limitations in governmental spending for medicare and medicaid programs 
recent actions by congress could limit government spending for the medicare and medicaid programs  limit payments to hospitals and other providers and increase emphasis on competition and other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship 
if our pricing of prepackaged medications experiences significant downward pressure  our business will be less profitable and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  because cash from sales of prepackaged medications funds some of our working capital requirements  reduced profitability with respect to prepackaged medications could require us to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need 
if we are unable to maintain existing relationships and create new relationships with managed care payers  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we rely on managed care organizations to reimburse our physician customers for prescription medications dispensed in their offices 
while many of the leading managed care payers and pharmacy benefit managers currently reimburse our physicians for in office dispensing  none of these payers is under a long term obligation to do so 
if we are unable to increase the number of managed care payers that reimburse for in office dispensing  
table of contents or if some or all of the payers who currently reimburse physicians decline to do so in the future  utilization of our products and services would decrease and  therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we incur costs exceeding our insurance coverage in lawsuits pending against us or that are brought against us in the future  it could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are a defendant in numerous multi defendant lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine and phentermine 
in the event we are found liable in any lawsuits filed against us  and if our insurance coverage were inadequate to satisfy these liabilities  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business legal proceedings 
if our principal supplier fails or is unable to perform its contract with us  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers 
we currently purchase a majority of the medications that we repackage from amerisourcebergen  pursuant to an agreement which expires on february   with an option to renew for an additional two years upon mutual agreement 
if we do not meet certain minimum purchasing requirements  amerisourcebergen may increase the prices that we pay under this agreement  in which case we would have the option to terminate the agreement 
although we believe that there are a number of other sources of supply of medications  if amerisourcebergen fails or is unable to perform under our agreement  particularly at certain critical times during the year  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers  and our relationships with our customers could suffer 
our failure to license and integrate third party technologies could harm our business 
we depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our solutions from third party vendors  including microsoft  and intend to continue licensing technologies from third parties 
these technologies might not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our third party licenses are non exclusive and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us 
our use of third party technologies exposes us to increased risks  including  but not limited to  risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions  the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
in addition  if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts  we might not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions 
if we do not maintain and expand our business with our existing customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business model depends on the success of our efforts to sell additional products and services to our existing customers 
for example  certain of our clinical solutions group customers initially purchase one or a limited number of our modules 
these customers might choose not to expand their use of or purchase additional modules 
in addition  as we deploy new applications and features for our existing solutions or introduce new solutions and services  our current customers could choose not to purchase these new offerings 
if we fail to generate additional business from our current customers  our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease 

table of contents risks related to our industry we are subject to a number of existing laws  regulations and industry initiatives  non compliance with certain of which could shut down our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 
as a participant in the healthcare industry  our operations and relationships  and those of our customers  are regulated by a number of federal  state and local governmental entities 
the impact of this on us is direct  to the extent we are ourselves subject to these laws and regulations  and is also indirect in that  in a number of situations  even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations  our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations 
inability of our customers to do so could affect the marketability of our products or our compliance with our customer contracts  or even expose us to direct liability on a theory that we had assisted our customers in a violation of healthcare laws or regulations 
because our business relationships with physicians are unique  and the healthcare technology industry as a whole is relatively young  the application of many state and federal regulations to our business operations and to our customers is uncertain 
it is possible that a review of our business practices or those of our customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect us 
in addition  the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth 
the healthcare industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation 
specific risks include  but are not limited to  risks relating to patient information 
as part of the operation of our business  our customers provide to us patient identifiable medical information related to the prescription drugs that they prescribe and other aspects of patient treatment 
government and industry legislation and rulemaking  especially the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  and standards and requirements published by industry groups such as the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  require the use of standard transactions  standard identifiers  security and other standards and requirements for the transmission of certain electronic health information 
new national standards and procedures under hipaa include the standards for electronic transactions and code sets the transaction standards  the security standards the security standards  and the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information the privacy standards 
the transaction standards require the use of specified data coding  formatting and content in all specified health care transactions conducted electronically 
the security standards require the adoption of specified types of security for healthcare information 
the privacy standards grant a number of rights to individuals as to their identifiable confidential medical information called protected health information and restrict the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities  defined as health care providers  health care payers  and health care clearinghouses 
generally  the hipaa standards directly affect covered entities 
we have reviewed our activities and believe that we are a covered entity to the extent that we maintain a group health plan for the benefit of our employees 
such a plan  even if not a separate legal entity from us as its sponsor  is included in the hipaa definition of covered entities 
we have taken steps we believe to be appropriate and required to bring our group health plan into compliance with hipaa 
we do not believe that we are a covered entity as a health care provider or as a health care clearinghouse  however  the definition of a health care clearinghouse is broad and we cannot offer any assurance that we could not be considered a health care clearinghouse under hipaa or that  if we are determined to be a healthcare clearinghouse  the consequences would not be adverse to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the privacy standards affect third parties that create or access protected health information in order to perform a function or activity on behalf of a covered entity 
such third parties are called business associates 
covered entities must have a written business associate agreement with such third parties  containing specified written satisfactory assurances that the third party will safeguard protected health information that it creates or 
table of contents accesses and will fulfill other material obligations to support the covered entity s own hipaa compliance 
most of our customers are covered entities  and we function in many of our relationships as a business associate of those customers 
we would face liability under our business associate agreements if we do not comply with our business associate obligations 
in addition  the federal agencies with enforcement authority have taken the position that a covered entity can be subject to hipaa penalties and sanctions for a breach of a business associate agreement 
the penalties for a violation of hipaa by a covered entity are significant and could have an adverse impact upon our business  financial condition and results of operations  if such penalties ever were imposed 
additionally  covered entities will be required to adopt a unique standard national provider identifier npi for use in filing and processing health care claims and other transactions 
subject to the discussion set forth above  we believe that the principal effects of hipaa are  first  to require that our systems be capable of being operated by our customers in a manner that is compliant with the various hipaa standards and  second  to require us to enter into and comply with business associate agreements with our covered entity customers 
for most covered entities  the deadlines for compliance with the privacy standards and the transaction standards occurred in covered entities were required to be in compliance with the security standards by april  and to use npis in standard transactions no later than the compliance dates  which are may  for all but small health plans and one year later for small health plans 
we have policies and procedures that we believe assure compliance with all federal and state confidentiality requirements for the handling of protected health information that we receive and with our obligations under business associate agreements 
in particular  we believe that our systems and products are capable of being used by our customers in compliance with the transaction standards and security standards and are  or will be  capable of being used by our customers in compliance with the npi requirements 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of protected health information  we could be subject to liability  fines and lawsuits  termination of our customer contracts or our operations could be shut down 
moreover  because all hipaa standards are subject to change or interpretation and because certain other hipaa standards  not discussed above  are not yet published  we cannot predict the full future impact of hipaa on our business and operations 
in the event that the hipaa standards and compliance requirements change or are interpreted in a way that requires any material change to the way in which we do business  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
additionally  certain state laws are not preempted by hipaa and may impose independent obligations upon our customers or us 
additional legislation governing the acquisition  storage and transmission or other dissemination of health record information and other personal information  including social security numbers  has been proposed at both the state and federal level 
such legislation may require holders of such information to implement additional security  reporting or other measures that may require substantial expenditures and may impose liability for a failure to comply with such requirements 
in many cases  such proposed state legislation includes provisions that are not preempted by hipaa 
there can be no assurance that changes to state or federal laws will not materially restrict the ability of providers to submit information from patient records using our products and services 
electronic prescribing 
the use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions  including electronic prescribing  electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing  is governed by state and federal law 
states have differing prescription format requirements  which we have programmed into our software 
many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate methods of e commerce now being developed 
while federal law and the laws of many states permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders  the laws of several states neither specifically permit nor specifically prohibit the practice 
given the rapid growth of electronic transactions in healthcare  and particularly the growth of the internet  we expect the remaining states to directly address these areas with regulation in the near future 
in addition  on november   the department of health and human services published its final e prescribing and the prescription drug program regulations e prescribing regulations 
these regulations are required by the medicare prescription 
table of contents drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma and became effective beginning on january  the e prescribing regulations consist of detailed standards and requirements  in addition to the hipaa electronic transaction standards discussed above  for prescription and other information transmitted electronically in connection with a drug benefit covered by the mma s prescription drug benefit 
these standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information 
the standards apply to prescription drug plans participating in the mma s prescription drug benefit 
aspects of our clinical products are affected by such regulation because of the need of our customers to comply  as discussed above 
compliance with these regulations could be burdensome  time consuming and expensive 
we also could become subject to future legislation and regulations concerning the development and marketing of healthcare software systems 
for example  regulatory authorities such as the us department of health and human services center for medicare and medicaid services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and ehr technologies 
these could increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable 
claims transmission 
our system electronically transmits claims for prescription medications dispensed by physicians to patients payers for immediate approval and reimbursement 
federal law provides that it is both a civil and a criminal violation for any person to submit  or cause to be submitted  a claim to any payer  including  without limitation  medicare  medicaid and all private health plans and managed care plans  seeking payment for any services or products that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient 
we have in place policies and procedures that we believe assure that all claims that are transmitted by our system are accurate and complete  provided that the information given to us by our customers is also accurate and complete 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims from being submitted  we could be subject to liability 
as discussed above  the hipaa transaction standards and the hipaa security standards also affect our claims transmission services  since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our customers hipaa compliance obligations 
medical devices 
the us food and drug administration fda has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
to the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy  we  as a manufacturer of such products  could be required  depending on the product  to register and list our products with the fda  notify the fda and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing such products  or obtain fda approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product 
depending on the intended use of a device  the fda could require us to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness or substantial equivalence 
if the fda requires this data  we would be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials 
clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete 
we cannot provide assurances that the fda will approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials 
in addition  these products would be subject to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act s general controls  including those relating to good manufacturing practices and adverse experience reporting 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the fda s policy with regard to computer software  we expect that the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft is finalized or changed 
the fda can impose extensive requirements governing pre and post market conditions like service investigation  approval  labeling and manufacturing 
in addition  the fda can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes 
e detailing 
our pharmaceutical and medical device clients use physicians interactive e detailing programs to provide physicians with valuable and up to date information about various medications and medical products  as well as to collect feedback from physician opinion leaders and other experts 
pharmaceutical marketing activities are subject to various regulatory and compliance initiatives  
table of contents including an industry sponsored ethics initiative developed by the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma code and the final compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers issued on april  by the hhs office of inspector general oig 
such initiatives  some of which are required and some of which are voluntary  articulate concerns  recommendations and standards concerning a variety of pharmaceutical product marketing activities and issues  including e detailing  kickbacks  discounts  switching arrangements  research consulting advisory payments  relationships with other healthcare providers  including physicians  and gifts entertainment other remuneration 
additionally  as a sender of electronic mail in connection with some of our educational programs  we are subject to the can spam act of and other state and federal laws regulating senders of electronic mail for commercial purposes 
we believe that our programs and activities comply with applicable laws and regulations and are consistent with phrma code and oig initiatives 
however  if our physician educational programs were found to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with such laws  regulations or initiatives  or if we are required to materially change the way in which we do business in order to conform with such laws  regulations and initiatives  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
licensure and physician dispensing 
as a repackager and distributor of drugs  we are subject to regulation by and licensure with the fda  the drug enforcement agency dea and various state agencies that regulate wholesalers or distributors 
among the regulations applicable to our repackaging operation are the fda s good manufacturing practices 
we are subject to periodic inspections of our facilities by regulatory authorities to confirm that we have policies and procedures in place in order to comply with applicable legal requirements 
because the fda s good manufacturing practices were designed to govern the manufacture  rather than the repackaging  of drugs  we face legal uncertainty concerning the application of some aspects of these regulations and of the standards that the fda will enforce 
if we do not maintain all necessary licenses  or the fda decides to substantially modify the manner in which it has historically enforced its good manufacturing practice regulations against drug repackagers or the fda or dea finds any violations during one of their periodic inspections  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be shut down 
while physician dispensing of medications for profit is allowed in most states  it is limited in a few states 
it is possible that certain states may enact further legislation or regulations prohibiting  restricting or further regulating physician dispensing 
similarly  while in a july opinion the american medical association s council on ethical and judicial affairs ceja provides  in relevant part  that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices provided such dispensing primarily benefits the patient  the american medical association has historically taken inconsistent positions on physician dispensing 
past reports of the ceja have opposed the in office sale of health related products by physicians  and it is possible that the ceja may in the future oppose the in office sale of health related products by physicians 
any such state legislative prohibitions or ceja opposition of physician dispensing could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
congress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self referrals in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of this law  commonly referred to as stark ii  applies to physician dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs that are reimbursable by medicare or medicaid 
stark ii  however  includes an exception for the provision of in office ancillary services  including a physician s dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs  provided that the physician meets specified requirements 
we believe that the physicians who use our system or dispense drugs distributed by us are aware of these requirements  but we do not monitor their compliance and have no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with stark ii 
if it were determined that the physicians who use our system or dispense pharmaceuticals purchased from us were not in compliance with stark ii  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents as a distributor of prescription drugs to physicians  we are subject to the federal anti kickback statute  which applies to medicare  medicaid and other state and federal programs 
the statute prohibits the solicitation  offer  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase  or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase  of goods  including drugs  covered by the programs 
the anti kickback law provides a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors for particular types of transactions 
we believe that our arrangements with our customers are in material compliance with the anti kickback statute and relevant safe harbors 
many states have similar fraud and abuse laws  and we believe that we are in material compliance with those laws 
if  however  it were determined that we  as a distributor of prescription drugs to physicians  were not in compliance with the federal anti kickback statute  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be curtailed 
moreover  if the activities of our customers or other entity with which we have a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the federal anti kickback law and we  as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity  were found to have knowingly participated in such activities  we could be subject to sanction or liability under such laws  including civil and or criminal penalties  as well as exclusion from government health programs 
as a result of exclusion from government health programs  neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program 
increased government involvement in healthcare could adversely affect our business 
us healthcare system reform under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  and other initiatives at both the federal and state level  could increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship 
while no federal price controls are included in the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act  any legislation that reduces physician incentives to dispense medications in their offices could adversely affect physician acceptance of our products 
we cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed  enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our products and services 
additionally  government regulation could alter the clinical workflow of physicians  hospitals and other healthcare participants  thereby limiting the utility of our products and services to existing and potential customers and curtailing broad acceptance of our products and services 
further examples of government involvement could include requiring the standardization of technology relating to ehr s  providing customers with incentives to adopt ehr solutions or developing a low cost government sponsored ehr solution  such as vista office ehr 
in addition  the federal government and state governments  including florida  have imposed or may in the future impose pedigree requirements for pharmaceutical distribution 
our medications business is required to comply with any current regulations relating to pharmaceutical distribution and will be required to comply with any future regulations and such compliance may impose additional costs on our business 
if the electronic healthcare information market fails to develop as quickly as expected  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the electronic healthcare information market is in the early stages of development and is rapidly evolving 
a number of market entrants have introduced or developed products and services that are competitive with one or more components of the solutions we offer 
we expect that additional companies will continue to enter this market 
in new and rapidly evolving industries  there is significant uncertainty and risk as to the demand for  and market acceptance of  recently introduced products and services 
because the markets for our products and services are new and evolving  we are not able to predict the size and growth rate of the markets with any certainty 
we cannot assure you that markets for our products and services will develop or that  if they do  they 
table of contents will be strong and continue to grow at a sufficient pace 
if markets fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become saturated with competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate  thus decreasing the number of market participants  competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense  and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
further  consolidation of management and billing services through integrated delivery systems may decrease demand for our products 
if we were forced to reduce our prices  our business would become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 
risks related to the a acquisition the a acquisition is one of the largest acquisitions we have achieved to date 
we will face challenges integrating a s operations and technology and may not realize anticipated benefits 
the a acquisition is our largest acquisition to date 
there is a risk that  due to the size of the a acquisition  we will be unable to integrate a into our operations as effectively as we have with prior acquisitions  which would result in fewer benefits to us from this acquisition than currently anticipated as well as increased costs 
for example  the integration of a s operations will require implementation of appropriate operations  management and financial reporting systems and controls 
we may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems  assimilating a s technology and operations and maintaining the customer base and goodwill of a to successfully integrate and fully benefit from a s technology  we must build sophisticated interfaces and successfully integrate a s practice management system 
the integration of a will require the focused attention of our management team  including a significant commitment of their time and resources 
the need for management to focus on integration matters could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the integration is not successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have assumed all of a s liabilities  including contingent liabilities 
if these liabilities are greater than expected  or if there are unknown a obligations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
as a result of the a acquisition  we have assumed all of a s liabilities  including contingent liabilities 
we may learn additional information about a s business that adversely affects us  such as unknown liabilities  issues relating to internal controls over financial reporting that could affect our ability to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws and regulatory requirements  including laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the a acquisition will be successful 
among other things  if a s liabilities are greater than expected  or if there are obligations of a of which we were not aware at the time of completion of the acquisition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have limited indemnification rights from the a shareholders with respect to liabilities of a if we are responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification rights or substantially in excess of amounts covered through any indemnification rights  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 

table of contents if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for a employees  we may not be able to effectively integrate their operations and technology 
in order to successfully integrate a s operations and technology into our own  we will require the continued services of a s sales  software development and professional services employees 
the pool of qualified personnel with experience working with or selling to acute and ambulatory care groups is limited 
competition for such qualified personnel can be intense  and we might not be successful in retaining a s employees 
if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for a employees  we may not be able to effectively integrate a s systems and operations 
we may fail to attract new customers or lose current customers as a result of the a acquisition 
the a acquisition may cause disruptions  including potential loss of customers and other business partners  in our or a s business  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience difficulty in supporting and transitioning a s customers  and  consequentially  certain of our current or potential new customers may cancel or defer requests for our services 
in addition  certain of a s healthcare technology solutions target markets in which we have limited direct prior experience  including the market for practice and care management solutions and offerings to hospitals and smaller physician practice groups 
if we fail to attract new customers or generate additional business from our current customers  we may not achieve our planned growth 
if a has failed or fails to comply with existing laws  government regulations and industry initiatives applicable to its operations  we could be harmed 
as a participant in the highly regulated healthcare industry  a s operations  as well as those of its customers  are or may be subject to federal  state and local government regulation 
if a has failed or fails to comply with healthcare laws and regulations  or a s products cannot be used by its customers in a manner that complies with healthcare laws and regulations  we could be subject to penalties for such violations and otherwise may be harmed 
risks related to our common stock because of certain features of our outstanding convertible senior debentures and anti takeover provisions under delaware law and in our organizational documents  a takeover of us may be difficult  and you may be prevented from obtaining an optimal price for our shares of common stock in the event of a takeover of us 
we are required to increase the conversion rate on our convertible senior debentures that are converted in connection with certain change of control transactions that occur on or prior to july   which effectively increases the cost of a takeover of the company 
in addition  in the event of a change of control of the company  subject to certain exceptions  holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase in cash all or any portion of their debentures 
these features may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage such a takeover 
additionally  certain provisions of delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  and by laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval to increase the number of outstanding shares and deter or prevent a takeover attempt  prohibit common stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all common stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our common stockholders  
table of contents prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise enable less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and provide for a classified board of directors  expanding the time required to change the composition of a majority of directors 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock that we may issue and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
as of march   we had approximately  shares of common stock outstanding   shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants   shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to stock options and other awards outstanding under our stock plans at a weighted average exercise price of per share   additional shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under our stock plans   shares of unvested restricted common stock to employees and directors  and  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of our outstanding convertible senior debentures 
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of these debentures is subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to anti dilution provisions 
on february   we entered into a purchase agreement with ge  idx and idx investment corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of idx which entities we collectively refer to as the ge entities  pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase from idx  shares of our common stock 
the repurchase of these shares closed on march  the terms of the purchase agreement also provide that the ge entities will not sell any of the remaining shares of our common stock owned by them for days starting on february   which was the date we priced on our public offering of stock  subject to certain exceptions 
on march   idx beneficially owned  shares of our common stock or approximately of our outstanding shares 
we are a party to a stock rights and restrictions agreement with idx which may impose restrictions on the ability of the ge entities to sell shares of our common stock after the expiration of the day period described above and the manner of such future sales 
however  the ge entities retain the ability to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by the ge entities in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
in connection with our acquisition strategy  we may issue shares of our common stock as consideration in other acquisition transactions 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents our outstanding convertible senior debentures are convertible at the option of the holders into shares of our common stock  subject to the certain conditions set forth in the indenture governing these debentures 
any shares of common stock issued on conversion of these debentures and subsequently sold will be freely tradable in the public markets without restriction 
in addition  we will be required to repurchase these debentures following certain change in control events relating to us  and the holders of these debentures will have the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on july   july  and july  the conversion of these debentures into common stock or the issuance of common stock to pay the purchase price of any such debentures could result in the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and substantial dilution to our stockholders 
our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
our board of directors also has the power  without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights except that shares of preferred stock may not have more than one vote per share  dividend rights  preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution  liquidation or winding up and other terms 
in the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock that is convertible into our common stock at greater than a one to one ratio  the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction favorable to the holders of our common stock 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have an adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  in accordance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to the factors described above and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by our competitors or us  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions and trends in the electronic healthcare information  internet  e commerce and pharmaceutical markets  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock markets  especially the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and internet related companies in particular 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to 
table of contents operating performance 
these broad market factors may materially affect the trading price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions and interest rate fluctuations may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
volatility in the market price for our common stock may result in the filing of securities class action litigation 
our quarterly operating results may vary 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to vary in future periods depending on a number of factors  some of which we have no control over  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures  seasonal variances in demand for our products and services  the sales  service and implementation cycles for our clinical software products and physician education products and services  potential downturns in the healthcare market and in economic conditions generally  and other factors described in this risk factors section 
for instance  all other factors aside  sales of our prepackaged medications have historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters 
sales of our software products have also historically been highest in the fourth quarter 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have lower revenue than expected  we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
in addition  our product sales cycle for larger sales is lengthy and unpredictable  making it difficult to estimate our future bookings for any given period 
if we do not achieve projected booking targets for a given period  securities analysts may change their recommendations on our common stock 
for these and other reasons  we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors  and our stock price could suffer 
conversion of the convertible senior debentures will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders  including holders who had previously converted their debentures 
the conversion of some or all of our convertible senior debentures will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could depress the price of our common stock

in each of these suits  we are one of many defendants  including manufacturers and other distributors of these drugs 
we do not believe we have significant liability incident to the distribution or repackaging of these drugs  and we have tendered defense of these lawsuits to our insurance carrier for handling 
in addition  we have been indemnified by the primary manufacturer of the drugs at issue in these cases 
we believe that it is unlikely that we are responsible for the distribution of the drugs at issue in many of these cases 
the lawsuits are in various stages of litigation  and it is too early to determine what  if any  liability we will have with respect to the claims made in these lawsuits 
if our insurance coverage and our indemnity from the drug manufacturer is inadequate to satisfy any resulting liability  we will have to defend these lawsuits and be responsible for the damages  if any  that we suffer as a result of these lawsuits

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from software licensing arrangements where the service element is considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement is accounted for under the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type contracts and certain production type contracts sop 
sop requires that management make estimates of the total value of the contract as well as the percentage of the contract that has been completed as of the end of each period 
changes in circumstances may cause management s estimates of the value of the contract or the effort required to complete the services to change 
the changes may cause us to adjust upward or downward the amount of revenue recognized or recognize less revenue than anticipated through the completion of the project 
certain of our customer arrangements in our software and services segment and information services segment encompass multiple deliverables 
we account for these arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
if the deliverables meet the criteria in eitf  the deliverables are separated into separate units of accounting and revenue is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative fair values 
the criteria specified in eitf are that the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
applicable revenue recognition criteria is considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
management applies judgment to ensure appropriate application of eitf  including value allocation among multiple deliverables  determination of whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements and timing of revenue recognition  among others 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement 
changes in circumstances and customer data may affect management s analysis of eitf criteria  which may cause us to adjust upward or downward the amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement 
the adoption of eitf during the second half of did not have a significant effect on our revenue recognition due to the methodology utilized prior to eitf having very similar accounting treatment for multiple deliverables 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we rely on estimates to determine our bad debt expense and the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
inventories we adjust the value of our inventory downward for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
investment in promissory note and minority interest allscripts holds an investment in medem totaling  as of december  the investment has been accounted for under the cost basis of accounting and is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the investment consists of a  note receivable from and a minority interest in medem 
the fair value of the investment is dependent upon the actual financial performance of medem  its market value  and the volatility inherent in the external markets for this type of investment 
in assessing potential impairment of the investment  we consider these factors  as well as the forecasted financial performance of medem  liquidation preference value of the stock that we hold  and estimated potential for investment recovery 
if any of these factors indicate that the investment has become other than temporarily impaired  we may have to record an impairment charge 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the value of intangible assets based upon the present value of the future economic benefits expected to be derived from the assets 
we assess the impairment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if we determine that the value of the intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets and amortize the value over that estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful life or the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
software capitalization the carrying value of capitalized software is dependent upon the ability to recover its value through future revenue from the sale of the software 
if we determine in the future that the value of the capitalized software could not be recovered  a write down of the value of the capitalized software to its recoverable value may be required 
we estimate the useful life of our capitalized software and amortize the value over that estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful life or the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and for tax carryforward items and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not likely

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
this statement requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements

the related compensation expense will be based on the estimated number of awards expected to vest and will be recognized over the requisite service period often the vesting period for each grant 
the statement requires the use of assumptions and judgments about future events and some of the inputs to the valuation models will require considerable judgment by management
