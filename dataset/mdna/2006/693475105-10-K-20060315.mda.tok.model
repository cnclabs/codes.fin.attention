we also intend to grow through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and  in certain businesses  by expanding into new geographical markets 
in recent years  we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
our actions have created a balance sheet characterized by strong asset quality and significant flexibility to take advantage  where appropriate  of changing interest rates and to adjust to changing market conditions 
on february   we announced that blackrock and merrill lynch had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which merrill lynch will contribute its investment management business to blackrock in exchange for newly issued blackrock common and preferred stock

initiatives to achieve this growth are progressing according to plan 
we realized a net pretax financial benefit from the one pnc program of approximately million in  primarily in the latter half of the year and primarily in our banking businesses  which was million more than we had previously estimated 
we achieved this benefit by accelerating some of the initiatives into we expect to capture approximately million in value by the end of as originally planned 
key factors affecting financial performance our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions  loan demand and utilization of credit commitments  interest rates  and the shape of the interest rate yield curve  the performance of the capital markets  and customer demand for other products and services

table of contents consolidated income statement review net interest income overview changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest earning assets and related yields  interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid  and noninterest bearing sources 
see statistical information analysis of year to year changes in net interest income and average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis in item of this report for additional information 
net interest income gaap reconciliation the interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax 
as such  these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment 
to provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets  we also provide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments 
this adjustment is not permitted under gaap 
a reconciliation of net interest income as reported in the consolidated income statement gaap basis to net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis follows in millions for the year ended december  net interest income  gaap basis taxable equivalent adjustment net interest income  taxable equivalent basis taxable equivalent net interest income increased million in compared with due to strong growth in earning assets and deposits

higher balances of interest earning trading assets for  which negatively affected the overall yield on interest earning assets 
the factors above were partially offset by the favorable impact on net interest margin in of an increase of basis points related to noninterest bearing sources of funding 
see consolidated income statement review under the versus section of item of this report for further information regarding taxable equivalent net interest income and margin 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses decreased million  to million  for compared with the decline in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the benefit of a million loan recovery in the second quarter of resulting from a litigation settlement  in addition to continued strong asset quality 
the favorable impact of these factors on the provision was partially offset by the impact of total average loan and loan commitments growth in compared with the prior year 
we expect loan and loan commitment growth to continue to impact the provision during in addition  we do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level and we expect a higher provision for credit losses in however  based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities  we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong for at least the near term 
see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of item for additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses 
also see allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in that credit risk management section for additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses

corporate services revenue was million for  compared with million in corporate services revenue in benefited from the impact of higher net gains on commercial mortgage loan sales  higher fees related to commercial mortgage servicing activities  increased loan syndication fees and higher capital markets revenues  including revenues attributable to harris williams  compared with the prior year

as a component of our advisory services to clients  we provide a select set of insurance products to fulfill specific customer financial needs 
primary insurance offerings include annuities  life  credit life  health  disability  and commercial lines coverage

in the normal course of business  pnc insurance corp 
and alpine indemnity limited maintain insurance reserves for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported based on actuarial assessments 
we believe these reserves were adequate at december  noninterest expense total noninterest expense was billion for  an increase of million compared with the efficiency ratio was for and for we expect noninterest expense to be flat in compared with except for the increase in our ownership in the merchant services business and the impact of the harris williams acquisition 
noninterest expense for included the following an increase of million in blackrock non ltip operating expenses that reflected the impact of costs resulting from the first quarter ssrm acquisition and other investments to fund growth  costs totaling approximately million resulting from our riggs acquisition  including approximately million of integration costs  blackrock ltip charges of million  implementation costs totaling million related to the one pnc initiative  contributions of blackrock stock to the pnc foundation of million  and costs totaling million related to the harris williams acquisition

noninterest expense for included a million charge associated with the blackrock ltip and conversion related and other nonrecurring costs totaling approximately million related to our acquisition of united national bancorp  inc apart from the impact of these items  noninterest expense increased million  or  in compared with these higher expenses were driven by investments in our businesses and increased sales incentives 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate was for both and several factors contributed to a relatively low effective tax rate for each year 
the low effective rate for was primarily attributable to the impact of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the transfer of our ownership in blackrock to our intermediate bank holding company 
this transaction reduced our first quarter tax provision by million  or 
per diluted share 
see note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
the following favorably impacted the effective tax rate for a reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of million recorded in connection with new york state and city audit findings  primarily associated with blackrock  and a million reduction in income tax expense following our determination that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank owned life insurance 
we expect the effective tax rate in to be closer to the statutory tax rate

higher total assets at december  compared with the prior year end were driven by loan growth resulting primarily from continued improvements in market loan demand  higher securities balances that reflected normal portfolio activity  purchases  and the impact of our expansion into the greater washington  dc area 
an analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows 
loans  net of unearned income loans increased billion  or  as of december  compared with december  improvements in market loan demand  in addition to targeted sales efforts across our banking businesses  drove the increase in total loans compared with the prior year end

commercial lending exposure a december in millions investment grade or equivalent non investment grade million or greater all other non investment grade total a includes all commercial loans in the retail banking and corporate institutional banking business segments other than the loans of market street 
we deconsolidated market street from our consolidated balance sheet effective october  cross border leases and related tax and accounting matters the equipment lease portfolio totaled billion at december  and included approximately billion of cross border leases 
cross border leases are primarily leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries  primarily in western europe and australia 
we no longer enter into cross border lease transactions 

table of contents aggregate residual value at risk on the total commercial lease portfolio at december  was billion 
we have taken steps to mitigate 
billion of this residual risk  including residual value insurance coverage with third parties  third party guarantees  and other actions 
upon completing examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns  the irs provided us with an examination report which proposed increases in our tax liability  principally arising from adjustments to several of our cross border lease transactions 
the proposed adjustments would reverse the tax treatment of these transactions as we reported them on our filed tax returns 
we believe the method we used to report these transactions is supported by appropriate tax law and have filed a protest and begun discussions of the irs examination findings with the irs appeals office 
while we cannot predict with certainty the result of filing the protest and resultant discussions  any resolution would most likely involve a change in the timing of tax deductions which  in turn  depending on the exact resolution  could significantly impact the economics of these transactions 
the irs has begun an audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns 
we expect them to again make adjustments to the cross border lease transactions referred to above as well as to new cross border lease transactions entered into during those years 
we believe our reserves for these exposures were adequate at december  in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a proposed staff position to consider whether any change in the timing of tax benefits associated with these types of transactions should result in a recalculation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases 
the fasb has had further discussions on this proposal in the fasb s current position is that any cumulative adjustment will be recognized through opening retained earnings in the year of adoption under the provisions of sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
see note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on sfas assuming that the fasb staff position becomes effective january   we believe that the cumulative adjustment from the recalculations would be in the range of approximately million to million after tax 
under the leveraged leasing accounting rules  any immediate or future reductions in earnings from the change in accounting would be recovered in subsequent years 
in addition to the transactions referred to above  three lease to service contract transactions that we were party to were structured as partnerships for tax purposes 
these partnerships are under audit by the irs 
however  we do not believe that our exposure from these transactions is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
aircraft and vehicle leasing businesses on september   we acquired the business of the aviation finance group  llc afg  an idaho based company that specializes in loans to finance private aircraft 
by combining the business of afg with our existing business  we have increased our ability to offer a variety of loans and leasing products to corporate aircraft customers

see the off balance sheet arrangements and consolidated vies section of item and note variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further information regarding market street 
the remaining increase in consumer net unfunded commitments at december  compared with the balance at december  was primarily due to net unfunded commitments related to growth in open ended home equity loans

securities represented of total assets at december  compared with at december  the increase in total securities compared with december  was primarily due to the acquisition of riggs and normal portfolio activity 
at december   the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of million  which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost 
the comparable amount at december  was a net unrealized loss of million 
the increase in the net unrealized loss at december  reflected the impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during partially offset by the sales of securities during the second quarter of as discussed below 
we evaluate our portfolio of securities available for sale in light of changing market conditions and other factors and  where appropriate  take steps intended to improve our overall positioning 
in late april and early may we sold billion of securities available for sale and terminated billion of resale agreements that were most sensitive to extension risk due to rising short term interest rates 
we also purchased billion of securities with higher yields and lower extension risk 
these transactions resulted in realized net securities and other losses of approximately million  which are included in our results of operations for the fair value of securities available for sale decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa 
further increases in interest rates in  if sustained  will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale going forward compared with the fair value at december  net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  net of tax

the increase in deposits as of december  reflected sales and retention efforts related to core deposits as well as the impact of our expansion into the greater washington  dc area 
higher borrowed funds at december  were driven in part by the following transactions senior bank note issuances of million in march  million in july and million in august  senior debt issuances of million in march and million in december and blackrock s issuance of million of convertible debentures in february  subordinated bank debt issuance of million in september and the assumption of million of subordinated debt related to the riggs transaction  billion of fhlb advances issued in june  and higher short term borrowings to fund asset growth 
these factors were partially offset by maturities of million of senior bank notes and million of subordinated debt during capital we manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition  issuing debt and equity instruments  making treasury stock transactions  maintaining dividend policies and retaining earnings 
the increase of billion in total shareholders equity at december  compared with december  primarily reflected the impact of retained earnings of million and the issuance of million of shares in connection with the riggs acquisition 
common shares outstanding at december  were million  an increase of million over december  we issued approximately million shares of common stock during the second quarter of in connection with the riggs acquisition and approximately 
million shares during the fourth quarter in connection with the harris williams acquisition 
in february  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions through february the repurchase authorization was a replacement and continuation of the prior repurchase program 
under these programs  we purchased million common shares during at a total cost of million 
a new program to purchase up to million shares was authorized as of february  and replaced the program  which was terminated 
during  we purchased 
million common shares at a total cost of million under both the and common stock repurchase programs  all of which occurred during the first quarter 
the common stock repurchase program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified  superseded or terminated 
the extent and timing of additional share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including  among others  market and general economic conditions  economic and regulatory capital considerations  alternative uses of capital  and the potential impact on our credit rating 
the impact on our capital of asset growth  including acquisitions  has restricted share repurchases and could continue to do so over the next several quarters although capital growth as a result of earnings and the anticipated consequences of the completion of blackrock s acquisition of merrill lynch s investment management business would increase our flexibility in this area

market street is a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit that is owned by an independent third party 
market street s activities are limited to the purchasing of assets or making of loans secured by interests primarily in pools of receivables from us corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market 
market street funds the purchases or loans by issuing commercial paper which has been rated a p by standard poor s and moody s  respectively  and is supported by pool specific credit enhancement  liquidity facilities and program level credit enhancement 
pnc bank  na provides certain administrative services  a portion of the program level credit enhancement and the majority of liquidity facilities to market street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates 
credit enhancement is provided in part by pnc bank  na in the form of a cash collateral account that is funded by a loan facility that expires march  see note loans  commitments to extend credit and concentrations of credit risk and note commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
pnc views its credit exposure to market street transactions as

all of market street s assets at december  and collateralize the commercial paper obligations 
for the most part  pnc is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if market street s assets are in default 
our obligations are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the sellers or another third party

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  we consolidated market street effective july  as we were deemed the primary beneficiary of market street 
in october  market street was restructured as a limited liability company and entered into a subordinated note purchase agreement note with an unrelated third party 
the principal amount of the note was increased to million by december  and has an original maturity of eight years 
the note bears interest at with any penalty interest fees charged by market street on specific transactions accruing to the benefit of the note holder 
proceeds from the issuance of the note were placed in a first loss reserve account that may be used to reimburse any losses incurred by market street  pnc bank  na or other providers under the liquidity facilities and the credit enhancement arrangements 
as a result of the note issuance  we reevaluated whether pnc continued to be the primary beneficiary of market street under the provisions of fin r 
based on this analysis  we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated market street from our consolidated balance sheet effective october  we make certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the low income housing tax credit lihtc pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital  to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the community reinvestment act 
the primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification  development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants 
generally  these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity  with equity typically comprising to of the total project capital 
we consolidated those lihtc investments in which we own a majority of the limited partnership interests 
we also consolidated entities in which we  as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity  serve as the general partner together with the aforementioned lihtc investments  and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership interests 
in these syndication transactions  we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and sells limited partnership interests to third parties  and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund 
the fund s limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time 
the purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees by managing the funds 
general partner activities include selecting  evaluating  structuring  negotiating  and closing the fund investments in operating limited partnerships  as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio 
the assets are primarily included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
neither creditors nor equity investors in the lihtc investments have any recourse to our general credit 
the consolidated aggregate assets and debt of these lihtc investments are provided in the consolidated vies pnc is primary beneficiary table and reflected in the corporate institutional banking business segment 
we have a significant variable interest in certain other limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects 
we do not own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities and are not the primary beneficiary 
we use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities 
information regarding these partnership interests is reflected in the non consolidated vies significant variable interests table

results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our operating structure 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to gaap  therefore  the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
we refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change 
financial results are presented  to the extent practicable  as if each business operated on a stand alone basis 
as permitted under gaap  we have aggregated the business results for certain operating segments for financial reporting purposes 
our capital measurement methodology is based on the concept of economic capital 
however  we have increased the capital assigned to certain business segments 
capital assigned to retail banking has been increased to of funds to reflect the capital required for well capitalized banks and to approximate market comparables for this business 
the capital for blackrock and pfpc has been increased to reflect their legal entity shareholders equity 
blackrock s capital is consistent with its separate public company financial statement disclosures 
we have allocated the allowance for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services

the wealth management business sustained solid growth over as asset management fees increased million as a result of pricing enhancements  certain one time fees and the expansion into the greater washington  dc area 
assets under management totaled billion at december  compared with billion at december  our expansion into the greater washington  dc area in the second quarter of has resulted in solid growth  with checking relationships increasing by during the last six months of in the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of an additional interest in our merchant services business from first data 
this transaction gives us a ownership interest and positions us to take advantage of the payment revenue sources from small business customers 
results of this business are now consolidated in our financial statements 
noninterest expense increased million compared with and reflected the expansion into the greater washington  dc area 
retail banking s efficiency ratio improved to compared with a year earlier 
credit quality remained strong and stable 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loan outstandings were 
for compared with 
in total revenue for was billion compared with billion for the same period last year 
taxable equivalent net interest income of billion increased million  or  compared with due to a increase in average deposits and a increase in average loan balances 
the net interest income growth has been somewhat mitigated by a narrower spread between loan yields and deposit costs 
noninterest income increased million  or  compared with primarily driven by increased asset management revenue  service charges on deposits and consumer service fees 
growth in the latter two areas can be attributed mainly to a growing customer base 
increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a decrease in gains from sales of education loans of million compared with  a million pretax gain from the sale of certain investment consulting activities of hawthorn recognized in  and lower atm surcharge revenue in from changing customer behaviors and a strategic decision to reduce the out of footprint atm network 
the provision for credit losses declined million in compared with primarily due to a one time impact in the first quarter of associated with the decision to change the charge off policy related to smaller nonperforming commercial loans 
overall credit quality remained strong as evidenced by the decline in nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans to 
as of december  compared with 
at the same time last year 
we expect that the provision for credit losses will increase with loan growth 
we have not been and we do not expect to be materially impacted by the recent changes in the federal bankruptcy laws 
noninterest expense in totaled billion  an increase of million  or  compared with retail banking incurred approximately million in operating costs as a result of the expansion into the greater washington  dc area in and recognized million in nonrecurring costs in associated with the united national acquisition 
excluding the impact of these expenses  noninterest expense declined million compared with this decline was reflected primarily in staff expense as a result of one pnc initiatives 
full time employees at december  totaled  a decline of from december  the expansion into the greater washington  dc area accounted for an increase in full time employees of at december  excluding the impact of this expansion on full time employees  the number of retail banking full time employees at december  declined compared with december  we have adopted a relationship based lending strategy to target specific customer sectors homeowners  small businesses and auto dealerships while seeking to maintain a moderate risk profile in the loan portfolio 
average home equity loans grew by billion  or  compared with the increase was attributable to billion from organic loan growth  
billion from expansion into the greater washington  dc area and 
billion from portfolio purchases 
consumer loan demand is starting to slow as a result of the rising rate environment 
average commercial loans grew on the strength of increased loan demand from existing small business customers and the acquisition of new relationships through our sales efforts 
new loan volume in the small business arena increased over 
table of contents average residential mortgage loans increased million  or  primarily due to the addition of loans from the greater washington  dc area acquisition 
payoffs in our existing portfolio  which will continue throughout  reduced the impact of the additional loans acquired 
growing core checking deposits as a lower cost funding source and as the cornerstone product to build customer relationships are primary objectives of our deposit strategy 
average total deposits increased billion  or  compared with the deposit growth was driven by increases in the number of checking relationships new customer acquisition and the expansion into the greater washington  dc area and the recapture of consumer certificate of deposit balances as interest rates have risen 
during this rising rate environment  we expect the rate of growth in demand deposit balances to be less than the rate of growth for customer checking relationships 
additionally  we expect to see customers shift their funds from lower interest bearing deposits to higher yielding deposits or investment products 
the shift was evident during the second half of and impacted the level of average demand deposits in that period 
higher energy costs to consumers could also have a negative impact on demand deposit balance growth 
average demand deposit growth of million  or  was driven by a million increase in the core business due to continued growth in total checking relationships and million attributable to the expansion into the greater washington  dc area 
small business checking relationship retention has improved 
consumer checking relationship retention remains steady and strong due to increased penetration rates of debit card  online banking and online bill payment 
customer balances in other deposit products remained consistent while certificates of deposits increased billion 
this increase was attributable to the rising interest rate environment attracting customers back into this product 
assets under management of billion at december  declined billion compared with the balance at december  the effects of comparatively higher equity markets and the expansion into the greater washington  dc area were more than offset by net client asset outflows 
net client asset outflows are the result of ordinary course distributions from trust and investment management accounts and account closures exceeding investment additions from new and existing clients 
the net outflows were primarily related to a few significant low margin clients 
nondiscretionary assets under administration of billion at december  declined billion compared with the balance at december  the decline primarily reflects the loss of two sizeable master custody accounts with minimal earnings impact

the impact of the deconsolidation of market street effective october   the interest cost of funding the potential tax exposure on the cross border leasing portfolio  and a refined method of accounting for loan origination fees and costs partially offset these factors 
based on market conditions  we expect a slower rate of loan growth in future periods 
we also expect growth in deposits to continue in the near term 
the provision for credit losses was a million credit in compared with a million provision for the negative provision for resulted primarily from a million loan recovery in the second quarter of the increase in nonperforming assets over prior year end is attributable primarily to an increase in nonaccrual asset based loans

certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
we must use estimates  assumptions  and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at  or adjusted to reflect  fair value 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility 
fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources  when available 
when such third party information is not available  we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations 
allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  all of which may be susceptible to significant change  including  among others expected default probabilities  exposure at default  loss given default  amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages  and amounts for changes in economic conditions and potential estimation or judgmental errors 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we make specific allocations to impaired loans  to pools of watchlist and nonwatchlist loans and to consumer and residential mortgage loans 
we also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific  pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative and measurement factors 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the total reserve is available for all credit losses 
commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
we have allocated approximately million  or  of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at december  to the commercial loan category 
consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity 
approximately million  or  of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at december  have been allocated to these loans 
the remainder of the allowance is allocated primarily to commercial real estate and lease financing loans 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings 
see the following for additional information allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the credit risk management section of item of this report  note accounting policies and note asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses in the statistical information section in item of this report 
private equity asset valuation at december   private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled million compared with million at december  we value private equity assets at each balance sheet date based primarily on either  in the case of limited partnership investments  the financial statements received from the general partner or  for direct investments  the estimated fair value of the investments 
there is a time lag in our receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of our limited partnership interests 
we recognized in the fourth quarter of valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflected the impact of third quarter market conditions and performance of the underlying companies 
due to the nature of the direct investments  we must make assumptions as to future performance  financial condition  liquidity  availability of capital  and market conditions  among others  to determine the estimated fair value of the investments 
the valuation procedures that we apply to direct investments include techniques such as cash flow multiples for the entity  independent appraisals of the value of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction 
we value affiliated partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments 

table of contents we reflect changes in the value of equity management investments in our results of operations 
market conditions and actual performance of the companies that we invest in could differ from these assumptions  resulting in lower valuations that could reduce earnings in future periods 
accordingly  the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments 
lease residuals we provide financing for various types of equipment  aircraft  energy and power systems  and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements 
direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property  less unearned income 
residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities cover a significant portion of the residual value 
residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers 
to the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party  or otherwise insured against  we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets 
this includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value  which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future 
these residual values are reviewed for impairment no less than on an annual basis 
see note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
goodwill goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the fund servicing  retail banking and corporate institutional banking businesses 
the value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and international basis 
we also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features  and the ease of access to our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by earnings  which is driven by the volume of business transacted and  for certain businesses  the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided 
lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could result in a charge and reduced earnings in the future 
at least annually  management evaluates events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill 
see note accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
revenue recognition we derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources  including lending  securities portfolio  investment management and fund servicing  customer deposits  loan servicing  brokerage services  sale of loans and securities  certain private equity activities  and securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange 
we also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees  selling various insurance products  providing treasury management services and mergers and acquisitions advisory and related services and participating in certain capital markets transactions 
the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates  judgments  assumptions  and interpretation of contractual terms 
changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products  market conditions or industry norms

income taxes because our ownership interest in blackrock  as measured by value  is less than  federal tax law requires us to file two consolidated federal income tax returns one for pnc and subsidiaries excluding the consolidated results of blackrock and its subsidiaries  and a second return solely for blackrock and its subsidiaries 
we and our subsidiaries also file state and local income tax returns in many jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations 
in addition  filing requirements  methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations 
we evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions  filing positions  filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent  and other information  and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits 
the result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate 
we and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities 
in the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued  we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter 
our tax treatment of certain leasing transactions is currently being challenged by the irs  as described in greater detail in cross border leases and related tax and accounting matters in the consolidated balance sheet review section of item of this report 
legal contingencies we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims  including those described in note legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report and others arising in the normal course of our business 
we review these matters with internal and external legal counsel and establish reserves when we determine that it is probable that a 
table of contents liability has been incurred and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly review and adjust the reserves as appropriate to reflect changes in the status of the proceedings and claims 
the reserves that we establish for these types of contingencies are based upon our opinion regarding the future outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims at the time 
the final resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims is frequently different  possibly significantly  from the resolution we anticipated 
also  we may not be able to reasonably estimate a potential loss from a proceeding even if some liability is probable and an actual loss is later incurred 
as a result  our ultimate financial exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims may be substantially different from what is reflected in the related reserves 
blackrock long term retention and incentive plan see note stock based compensation plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a description of blackrock s ltip 
under the blackrock ltip  awards vest at the end of any three month period beginning on or after january  and ending on or prior to march  during which the average closing price of blackrock s common stock is at least per share 
during the first quarter of  blackrock s average closing stock price exceeded the threshold and the stock price provision was met 
in addition to the stock price threshold  the vesting of awards is contingent on the participants continued employment with blackrock for periods ranging from two to five years through the payment date in early we reported pretax charges in totaling million in connection with the ltip  including million in the third quarter  based upon management s determination during the third quarter of that the likelihood of vesting of the ltip awards was probable of reaching the stock price threshold 
these amounts included a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our investment in blackrock that is expected to occur in when we transfer shares of blackrock stock owned by pnc to fund a portion of the ltip awards 
we reported pretax expense of million in  including million during the fourth quarter  related to the ltip awards

table of contents status of defined benefit pension plan we have a noncontributory  qualified defined benefit pension plan plan or pension plan covering eligible employees 
retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels  age and length of service 
pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants 
plan assets are currently approximately invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments 
plan fiduciaries determine and review the plan s investment policy 
we calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and we use assumptions and methods that are compatible with the requirements of sfas  including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value 
on an annual basis  we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan  including the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets 
neither the discount rate nor the compensation increase assumptions significantly affect pension expense 
the expected long term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense 
we intend to decrease the expected long term return on plan assets assumption from the used for to for determining net periodic cost for also  under current accounting rules  the difference between expected long term returns and actual returns are accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods 
each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in the following year to change by up to million 
the table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in assumptions  using estimated expense as a baseline 
change in assumption estimated increase to pension expense in millions 
decrease in discount rate 
decrease in expected long term return on assets 
increase in compensation rate we currently estimate a pretax pension benefit of million in compared with a pretax benefit of million in in accordance with sfas and sfas revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  we may have to eliminate any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year end 
we would recognize the corresponding charge as a component of other comprehensive income and it would reduce total shareholders equity  but it would not affect net income 
at december   the fair value of plan assets was billion  which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of billion 
the status at year end will depend primarily upon investment returns and the level of contributions  if any  we make to the plan during plan asset investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements 
however  contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions 
investment performance will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years 
also  current law sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan 
in any event  any large near term contributions to the plan will be at our discretion  as we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be minimal or zero for several years 
during the second quarter of  we acquired a frozen defined benefit pension plan as a result of the riggs acquisition 
plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the riggs plan were approximately million and million  respectively  at acquisition date 
the million funding deficit was recognized as part of the riggs acquisition purchase price allocation 
for determining contribution amounts to the plan  deficits are calculated using erisa mandated rules  and on this basis we contributed approximately million to the riggs plan during the third quarter of we integrated the riggs plan into the pnc plan on december  we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results  including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees

risk management we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks 
this risk management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement  control strategies  and monitoring aspects of our corporate level risk management processes 
following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk credit  operational  liquidity  and market 
the discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate  trading  and equity and other investment risk areas 
our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the risk management section of this item in appropriate places within this section  historical performance is also addressed 
overview as a financial services organization  we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision 
for example  every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer  process a payment  hire a new employee  or implement a new computer system  we incur a certain amount of risk 
as an organization  we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities 
risk management is not about eliminating risks  but about identifying and accepting risks and then effectively managing them so to optimize shareholder value 

table of contents the key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying  measuring  evaluating  and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis 
risk management practices support decision making  improve the success rate for new initiatives  and strengthen the organization 
corporate level risk management overview we support risk management through a governance structure involving the board  senior management and a corporate risk management organization 
although our board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management  committees of the board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure 
we use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile 
the executive risk management committee ermc  consisting of senior management executives  provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives  reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues 
the corporate risk management organization has the following key roles facilitate the identification  assessment and monitoring of risk across pnc  provide support and oversight to the businesses  and identify and implement risk management best practices  as appropriate 
risk measurement we conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk 
the primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital 
this primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk 
the economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses 
potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an a rating by the credit rating agencies 
economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses credit risk  fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments market risk  failure of people  processes or systems operational risk  and income losses associated with declining volumes  margins and or fees  and the fixed cost structure of the business business risk 
we estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level 
we routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks 
risk control strategies we centrally manage policy development and exception oversight through corporate level risk management 
corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies 
the corporate audit function performs an independent assessment of the internal control environment 
corporate audit plays a critical role in risk management  testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the audit committee of the board 
risk monitoring corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to our board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the corporation 
these reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues  including performance relative to risk tolerance limits 
both the board and the ermc provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports 
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a customer  counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms 
credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers  purchasing securities  and entering into financial derivative transactions 
credit risk is one of the most common risks in banking and is one of our most significant risks 
approved risk tolerances  in addition to credit policies and procedures  set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk 
we have established guidelines for acceptable levels of total borrower exposure  problem loans  and other credit measures 
we seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types 
we use loan participations with third parties  loan sales and syndications  and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations 
the credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for monitoring credit risk within pnc 
the corporate credit policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement  monitoring and reporting of our credit risk and reports to the chief risk officer 
corporate audit also provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the credit risk management process and adequacy of credit risk profile 

table of contents nonperforming  past due and potential problem assets see the nonperforming assets and related information table in the statistical information section of item of this report and included here by reference for details of the types of nonperforming assets that we held at december     and in addition  certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems 
total nonperforming assets at december  increased million  to million  compared with the prior year end primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual asset based loans 
foreclosed lease assets at december  and december  primarily represent our repossession of collateral related to a single airline industry credit 
this repossessed collateral is currently leased to a third party 
the amount of nonperforming loans that was current as to principal and interest was million at december  and million at december  we anticipate an increase in nonperforming loans going forward as we do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level 
however  based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities  we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong at least for the near term 
nonperforming assets by business in millions december december retail banking corporate institutional banking other total nonperforming assets change in nonperforming assets in millions january purchases transferred from accrual returned to performing principal reductions and payoffs asset sales charge offs and valuation adjustments december accruing loans and loans held for sale past due days or more amount percent of total outstandings dollars in millions dec

commercial commercial real estate consumer residential mortgage total loans loans held for sale total loans and loans held for sale loans and loans held for sale that are not included in nonperforming or past due categories but cause us to be uncertain about the borrower s ability to comply with existing repayment terms over the next six months totaled million and zero  respectively  at december   compared with million and zero  respectively  at december  approximately of these loans are in the corporate institutional banking portfolio 
allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans  the total reserve is available for all loan and lease losses 
in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses  we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
we report this allowance as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures 
this methodology is similar to the methodology we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we refer you to note asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report regarding changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit  and to the allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses table in the statistical information section of item of this report for additional information included herein by reference 
we establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
all nonperforming loans are considered impaired under sfas specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our special asset committee based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate  observable market price  or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
we establish specific allowance on all other impaired loans based on the loss given default credit risk rating 
allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans pool reserve allocations are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and are based on internal probability of default and loss given default credit risk ratings 
key elements of the pool reserve methodology include probability of default pd  which is based on historical default analyses and is derived from the borrower s internal pd credit risk rating and expected loan term  exposure at default ead  which is derived from historical default data  and loss given default lgd  which is based on historical loss data  collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the loan and is derived from the loan s internal lgd credit risk rating 

table of contents our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as pds  lgds and eads 
in general  a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans 
our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates 
to illustrate  if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by for all categories of non impaired commercial loans  then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by million 
additionally  other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations 
we make consumer including residential mortgage loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience 
we compute a four quarter average loss rate from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters 
we apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the end of the current period to determine the consumer loan allocation 
we establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific  pool and consumer reserve methodologies  such as  but not limited to  industry concentrations and conditions  credit quality trends  recent loss experience in particular sectors of the portfolio  experience  ability and depth of lending management  changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and the timing of available information 
the amount of reserves for these qualitative factors is assigned to loan categories and to business segments based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts 
enhancements to the reserve methodology in the third quarter of resulted in more precise modeling of pool allocations and reduced the amount of reserve allocated for qualitative factors 
this portion represented of the total allowance and 
of total loans at december  charge offs and recoveries year ended december dollars in millions charge offs recoveries net charge offs recoveries percent of averageloans commercial a commercial real estate consumer residential mortgage lease financing total commercial b commercial real estate consumer residential mortgage lease financing total a includes a million loan recovery 
b during the first quarter of  we changed our policy for recognizing charge offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans 
this change resulted in the recognition of an additional million of gross charge offs for the first quarter of apart from the impact of the items described in footnotes a and b above  commercial net charge offs declined million in compared with the prior year primarily due to an improvement in the overall credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio 
the increase in equipment lease financing net charge offs in compared with the prior year reflected an additional charge off in the fourth quarter of related to a single leasing customer 
aside from the impact of the million loan recovery in  increases in the provision for credit losses compared with and the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit as of december  reflected growth in loans and loan commitments and additional provisions related to a leasing customer 
the provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
we do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level 
however  based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities  we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong at least for the near term 
this outlook  combined with expected loan growth  may result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses in future periods 
credit related instruments credit default swaps credit default swaps provide  for a fee  an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying financial instruments 
we use the contracts to mitigate credit risk associated with commercial lending activities as well as proprietary derivative and convertible bond trading 
credit default swaps are included in the free standing derivatives table in the financial derivatives section of this risk management discussion 
we realized minimal net gains in connection with credit default swaps during and a net loss of million in interest rate derivative risk participation agreements we enter into risk participation agreements to share credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or take on credit exposure to generate revenue 
risk participation agreements are included in the free standing derivatives table in the financial derivatives section of this risk management discussion 
agreements entered into prior to july  are considered to be financial guarantees and  therefore  are not included in the financial derivatives section of this risk management discussion 
risk participation agreements entered into prior to july  used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of million at december  compared with million at december  risk participation agreements entered into in which we assumed credit risk exposure had a total notional amount of million at december  compared with million at december  
table of contents operational risk management operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems  human factors  or from external events 
operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways  including but not limited to the following errors related to transaction processing and systems  breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements  and business interruptions and execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties 
operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts  laws or regulations 
to monitor and control operational risk  we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of pnc 
management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program  given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level 
corporate operational risk management  reporting to the chief risk officer  oversees day to day operation risk management activities 
technology risk the technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework 
we have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure  sound  and compliant infrastructure for information management 
the technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture  structure and practices 
the application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls 
our business resiliency program manages the organization s capabilities to provide services in the case of an event that results in material disruption of business activities 
prioritization of investments in people  processes  technology and facilities are based on different types of events  business risk and criticality 
comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis  and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting 
insurance as a component of our risk management practices  we purchase insurance programs designed to protect us against accidental loss or losses which  in the aggregate  may significantly affect personnel  property  financial objectives  or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups 
pnc  through subsidiary companies  alpine indemnity limited and pnc insurance corp  participates as a reinsurer for its general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs 
pnc s risks associated with its participation as a reinsurer or direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits  annual aggregate limits  umbrella excess liability coverage and reinsurance ceded beyond per occurrence deductible limits 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost 
we manage liquidity risk to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances 
asset and liability management alm is accountable for managing the liquidity position within the limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies 
market risk management provides independent oversight for the measurement  monitoring and reporting of pnc s liquidity risk 
we typically maintain our liquidity position through a large and stable deposit base derived from our retail and wholesale banking activities  a portfolio of liquid investment securities  diversified sources of short term and long term wholesale funding  and significant unused borrowing capacity at both the fhlb and the federal reserve discount window 
liquid assets consist of short term investments federal funds sold  resale agreements and other short term investments and securities available for sale 
at december   our liquid assets totaled billion  with billion pledged as collateral for borrowings  trust  and other commitments 
pnc bank  na is a member of the fhlb and as such has access to advances from the fhlb secured generally by residential mortgages  other real estate related loans  and mortgage backed securities 
at december   our total unused borrowing capacity from the fhlb under current collateral requirements was billion 
we can also obtain funding through alternative forms of borrowing  including federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  and short term and long term debt issuances 
in july  pnc bank  na established a program to offer up to billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months 
as of december   pnc bank  na had issued billion of debt under this program  including the following issuances million of floating rate notes were issued in march and mature in april with interest payable monthly at the rate of month libor minus basis points 
senior bank notes totaling million were issued in july and million were issued in 
table of contents august these issuances mature in january and february  respectively 
interest will be reset monthly to month libor minus basis points and will be paid monthly on each issuance 
million of subordinated bank notes were issued in september and mature in september these notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 
none of the issuances outlined above are redeemable or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity 
in december  pnc bank  na established a program to offer up to billion of its commercial paper 
as of december   million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program 
our parent company s routine funding needs consist primarily of dividends to pnc shareholders  share repurchases  debt service  the funding of non bank affiliates  and acquisitions 
parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding month period 
in managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources  such as expected dividends to be received from pnc bank  na and potential debt issuance  and discretionary funding uses  the most significant of which is the external dividend to be paid on pnc s stock 
the principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from pnc bank  na  which may be impacted by the following capital needs  laws and regulations  corporate policies  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
also  there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries 
we provide additional information on these limitations in note regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report and include such information here by reference 
dividends may also be impacted by the bank s capital needs and by contractual restrictions

market risk management overview market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates  credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  and equity prices 
we are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities  among others traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans  private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors  and trading in fixed income products  equities  derivatives  and foreign exchange  as a result of customer activities  underwriting  and proprietary trading 
we have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify  measure  monitor  and report market risk 
market risk management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines  and reporting significant risks in the business to the risk committee of the board 
market risk management interest rate risk interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates  and consumer preferences  affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities 
because of repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products  changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings  but the economic values of these assets and liabilities as well 
alm centrally manages interest rate risk subject to interest rate risk limits and certain policies approved by the asset and liability committee alco and the risk committee of the board 
sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the years ended december  and december  follow

net interest income sensitivity simulation effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following months of basis point increase basis point decrease effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding months of basis point increase basis point decrease duration of equity model base case duration of equity in years key period end interest rates one month libor three year swap in addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates  we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments 
the following net interest income sensitivity to alternative rate scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two month periods assuming either the pnc economist s most likely rate forecast or implied market forward rates which result in a flatter rate scenario 
we are inherently sensitive to lower rates  combined with a flatter yield curve 
net interest income sensitivity to alternative rate scenarios as of december  pnc economist market forward first year sensitivity second year sensitivity when forecasting net interest income  we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  the volume and characteristics of new business  and the behavior of existing positions 
these assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table 
these simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature  they are replaced or repriced at market rates 
all changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon 
the graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternative scenarios one year forward 
logo over the last several years  we have taken steps to position our balance sheet to benefit from rising long term interest rates 
as a result of this program  we closed the year in an essentially rate neutral position 
going forward  we believe that we have the deposit funding base and flexibility to change our investment profile to take advantage  where appropriate  of changing interest rates and to adjust to changing market conditions 
market risk management trading risk our trading activities include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities  as well as customer driven and proprietary trading in fixed income securities  equities  derivatives  and foreign exchange contracts 
for each trading group eg  fixed income  derivatives  foreign exchange  we have implemented a set of risk limits that govern that particular group 
our overall corporate trading risk policy governs the nature and allocation of these limits 
we use a variety of statistical and non statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities 
we use value at risk var as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities 
var offers a common measure to compare trading risk across portfolios with exposures to different types of market factors 
as required under the market risk amendment to the basel accord  we calculate risk weighted capital for trading activities  which is driven by average var usage 
for internal risk management purposes  we also estimate the amount of economic capital required by trading activities at a level of confidence over a three month horizon 
this measure is driven by both average var usage and potential future usage based on portfolio var limits 
the risk committee of the board establishes an enterprise wide var limit on trading activities 
var limits for individual business units are established by alco 

table of contents the following table shows var usage for by product type var usage by product type in millions min 
max 
avg 
fixed income equity foreign exchange total to help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate var for each portfolio and enterprise wide  we use a process known as backtesting 
the backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the var levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day 
we would expect a maximum of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day var measure 
during the full year of  there were no such instances at the enterprise wide level 
the following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day var for the period

market risk management equity and other investment risk equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets 
in addition to extending credit  taking deposits  and underwriting and trading financial instruments  we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions  including management buyouts  recapitalizations  and later stage growth financings in a variety of industries 
we have investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments 
in addition  we have investments in non affiliated funds that invest in early stage and technology companies 
new commitments to all non affiliated private equity funds will continue to be minimal 
the economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors 
the primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital 
economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit  market and operational risk 
it is the worst case value depreciation over one year within a confidence level 
given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments  it can be a challenge to determine their fair values 
market risk management provides independent oversight of the valuation process 
various pnc business units manage our private equity and other investment activities 
our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines 
private equity the private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry  stage and type of investment 

table of contents private equity investments are reported at fair value 
changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in our results of operations 
due to the nature of the direct investments  we must make assumptions as to future performance  financial condition  liquidity  availability of capital  and market conditions  among other factors  to determine the estimated fair value of the investments 
market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions 
accordingly  lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
also  the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments 
see private equity asset valuation in the critical accounting policies and judgments section of item of this report for additional information 
at december   private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled million compared with million at december  as of december   approximately of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately is invested in various limited partnerships 
private equity unfunded commitments totaled million at december  compared with million at december  additionally  in october  we committed million to pnc mezzanine partners iii  lp  a million mezzanine fund  that will invest principally in subordinated debt securities with an equity component 
funding of this investment is expected to occur over a five year period 
the limited partnership will be consolidated for financial reporting purposes as pnc will have a ownership interest 
other investments we also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies 
as of december   major investments of this type included low income housing tax credits and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans 
other investments include blackrock s mutual funds  hedge funds  and cdos for which the economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets  or both 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
accordingly  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during periods of inflation  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power  however  is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates  which are an important determinant of our earnings 
financial derivatives we use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate  market and credit risk inherent in our business activities 
substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates 
interest rate and total return swaps  interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by us for interest rate risk management 
financial derivatives involve  to varying degrees  interest rate  market and credit risk 
for interest rate swaps and total return swaps  options and futures contracts  only periodic cash payments and  with respect to options  premiums  are exchanged 
therefore  cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments 
not all elements of interest rate  market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives  and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics  among other reasons 
accounting hedges fair value hedging strategies we enter into interest rate and total return swaps  interest rate caps  floors and futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial mortgage loans held for sale  commercial loans  bank notes  senior debt and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily due to changes in interest rates 
adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are recorded in interest income  interest expense or noninterest income depending on the hedged item 
accounting hedges cash flow hedging strategy we enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest income 
the fair value of these derivatives is reported in other assets or other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the effective portion of the derivatives 
when the hedged transaction culminates  any unrealized gains or losses related to these swap contracts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are included in interest income 
any ineffectiveness of the strategy  as defined by our documented policies and procedures  is reported in interest income 
free standing derivatives to accommodate customer needs  we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors  futures  swaptions  and foreign exchange and equity contracts 
we manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third party dealers 
the credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies 
we may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer 
for derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in trading noninterest income 

table of contents also included in free standing derivatives are transactions that we enter into for risk management and proprietary purposes that are not designated as accounting hedges  primarily interest rate and basis swaps  interest rate caps and floors  credit default swaps  option contracts and certain interest rate locked loan origination commitments as well as commitments to buy or sell mortgage loans 
basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments  based on notional amounts  of two floating rate financial instruments denominated in the same currency  one pegged to one reference rate and the other tied to a second reference rate eg  swapping payments tied to one month libor for payments tied to three month libor 
we use these contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate 
interest rate lock commitments for  as well as commitments to buy or sell  mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free standing derivatives 
our interest rate exposure on certain commercial mortgage interest rate lock commitments is economically hedged with pay fixed interest rate swaps and forward sales agreements 
these contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate 
we purchase and sell credit default swaps to mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on specifically identified existing lending relationships or to generate revenue from proprietary trading activities 
these derivatives typically are based upon the change in value  due to changing credit spreads  of publicly issued bonds 
we enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue 
we will make receive payments under these guarantees if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain credit agreements 
agreements entered into prior to july  are considered financial guarantees 
agreements entered into after june  are considered free standing derivatives 
we occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative 
at the inception of the financial instrument  we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument host contract  whether the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings  and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would not meet the definition of a derivative 
if the embedded derivative does not meet these three conditions  the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current earnings 
free standing derivatives also include positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market based upon stated risk management objectives

these increases were partially offset by debt maturities of billion during shareholders equity the increase of 
billion  to billion  in total shareholders equity at december  compared with the prior year end was primarily attributable to million of common stock issued as part of the january united national acquisition and a higher retention of earnings through in anticipation of the ssrm acquisition by blackrock and the pending acquisition of riggs 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the fair value of securities available for sale and cash flow hedge derivatives due to the impact of rising interest rates that began during the second quarter of and continued into the latter half of the year 
these fair value changes are captured in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of shareholders equity

duration of equity an estimate of the rate sensitivity of a firm s economic value of equity 
a negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity ie  positioned for rising interest rates  while a positive value implies liability sensitivity ie  vulnerable to rising rates 
for example  if the duration is years  the economic value of equity declines by for each basis point increase in interest rates 
earning assets assets that generate income  which include federal funds sold  resale agreements  other short term investments  including trading securities  loans held for sale  loans  net of unearned income  securities  and certain other assets 
economic capital represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency 
it is based on a measurement of economic risk  as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies
