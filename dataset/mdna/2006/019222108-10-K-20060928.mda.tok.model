home respiratory care products 
home respiratory care products represent one of allied s potential growth areas 
allied s broad line of home respiratory care products include aluminum oxygen cylinders  oxygen regulators  pneumatic nebulizers  portable suction equipment and the full line of respiratory disposable products 
medical gas equipment market 
the market for medical gas equipment consists of hospitals  alternate care settings and surgery centers 
the medical gas equipment group is broken down into three separate categories construction products  regulation devices and suction equipment  and disposable cylinders 
construction products 
allied s medical gas system construction products consist of in wall medical system components  central station pumps and compressors  and headwalls 
these products are typically installed during construction or renovation of a health care facility and are built in as an integral part of the facility s physical plant 
typically  the contractor for the facility s construction or renovation purchases medical gas system components from manufacturers and ensures that the design specifications of the health care facility are met 
allied s in wall components  including outlets  manifolds  alarms  ceiling columns and zone valves  serve a fundamental role in medical gas delivery systems 
central station pumps and compressors are individually engineered systems consisting of compressors  reservoirs  valves and controls designed to drive a hospital s medical gas and suction systems 
each system is designed specifically for a given hospital or facility  which purchases pumps and compressors from suppliers 
the company s sales of pumps and compressors are driven  in large part  by its share of the in wall components market 
the company s construction products are sold primarily to hospitals  alternate care settings and hospital construction contractors 
the company believes that it holds a major share of the us market for its construction products  that these products are installed in more than three thousand hospitals in the united states and that its installed base of equipment in this market will continue to generate follow on sales 
the company believes that most hospitals and sub acute care facility construction spending is for expansion or renovation of existing facilities 
many hospital systems and individual hospitals undertake major renovations to upgrade their operations to improve the quality of care they provide  reduce costs and attract patients and personnel 

table of contents regulation devices and suction equipment 
the company s medical gas system regulation products include flowmeters  vacuum regulators and pressure regulators  as well as related adapters  fittings and hoses which measure  regulate  monitor and help transfer medical gases from walled piping or equipment to patients in hospital rooms  operating theaters or intensive care areas 
the company s leadership position in the in wall components market provides a competitive advantage in marketing medical gas system regulation devices that are compatible with those components 
portable suction equipment is typically used when in wall suction is not available or when medical protocol specifically requires portable suction 
the company also manufactures disposable suction canisters  which are clear containers used to collect the fluids suctioned by in wall or portable suction systems 
the containers have volume calibrations  which allow the medical practitioner to measure the volume of fluids suctioned 
the market for regulation devices and suction equipment includes hospital and sub acute care facilities 
sales of these products are made through the same distribution channel as our respiratory care products 
the company believes that it holds a significant share of the us market in both regulation devices and suction equipment 
disposable cylinders 
disposable oxygen cylinders are designed to provide oxygen for short periods of time in emergency situations 
since they are not subjected to the same pressurization as standard containers  they are much lighter and less expensive than standard gas cylinders 
the company markets filled disposable oxygen cylinders through industrial safety distributors and similar customers  principally to first aid providers  restaurants  industrial plants and other customers that require oxygen for infrequent emergencies 
emergency medical products market 
emergency medical products are used in the treatment of trauma induced injuries 
the company s emergency medical products provide patient resuscitation or ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress as well as immobilization and treatment for burns 
the company has seen growth in the trauma care venue for health care services  as the trend continues toward providing health care outside the traditional hospital setting 
the company also expects that other countries will develop trauma care systems in the future  although no assurance can be given that such systems will develop or that they will have a favorable impact on the company 
sales of emergency medical products are made through specialized emergency medical products distributors to ambulance companies  fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations 
the emergency medical products are broken down into two categories respiratory resuscitator products and trauma patient handling products 
respiratory resuscitationproducts 
thecompany srespiratory resuscitation products include demand resuscitation valves  portable resuscitation systems  bag masks and related products  emergency transport ventilators  precision oxygen regulators  minilators  multilators and humidifiers 
demand resuscitation valves are designed to provide oxygen to breathing or non breathing patients 
in an emergency situation  they can be used with a mask or tracheotomy tubes and operate from a standard regulated oxygen system 
the company s portable resuscitation systems provide fast  simple and effective means of ventilating a non breathing patient during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and oxygen to breathing patients on demand with minimal inspiratory effort 
the company also markets a full line of disposable and reusable bag mask resuscitators  which are available in a variety of adult and child size configurations 
disposable mouth to mask resuscitation systems have the added advantage of reducing the risk of transmission of communicable diseases 
the company s autovent transport ventilator can meet a variety of needs in different applications ranging from typical emergency medical situations to more sophisticated air and ground transport 
each autovent is accompanied by a patient valve  which provides effective ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress 
when administration of oxygen is required at the scene of a disaster  in military field hospitals or in a multiple victim incident  allied s minilators and multilators are capable of providing oxygen to one or a large number of patients

the company makes larger metal components from sheet metal using computerized punch presses  brake presses and shears 
in its plastics manufacturing processes  the company utilizes both extrusion and injection molding 
the company believes that its production facilities and equipment are in good condition and sufficient to meet planned increases in volume over the next few years and that the conditions in local labor markets should permit the implementation of additional shifts and days operated 

table of contents research and development allied s research and development group is responsible for the development of new products 
this group is staffed with mechanical and electrical engineers 
during fiscal year the research and development group completed the design and released to manufacturing a new hospital alarm system and gas manifold system 
in addition  a new bag mask resuscitator with a mask restraining system was released for use in the ems and hospital markets 
the research and development group has also completed the design of an accessory for a bag mask resuscitator that will help ems personnel use the bag mask per the american heart association guidelines 
this product is pending k approval and will be released for sale in the second quarter of fiscal year as part of the agreement relating to the withdrawal of the baralyme product  abbott has agreed to pay to allied up to  in product development costs to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorption product for use in connection with inhalation anesthetics that does not contain potassium hydroxide and does not produce a significant exothermic reaction with currently available inhalation agents 
it is allied s intention to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorption product 
as of june  the company had spent  to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorbent 
as of june  the company had been reimbursed  by abbott 
more detailed information concerning this agreement is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation the company s products and its manufacturing activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by federal and state authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  medical devices for human use are subject to comprehensive review by the united states food and drug administration the fda 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act  and other federal statutes and regulations  govern or influence the research  testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of such products 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters  fines  recall or seizure of products  injunction  refusal to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the united states  refusal of the government to clear or approve marketing applications or to allow the company to enter into government supply contracts  or withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
the company is required to file a premarket notification in the form of a premarket approval pma with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that offers new technology that is currently not on the market 
the company also must file a premarket notification in the form of a k with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that utilizes existing technology for devices that are currently on the market 
the k submission process is also required when the company makes a change or modifies an existing device in a manner that could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness 
compliance with the regulatory approval process in order to market a new or modified medical device can be uncertain  lengthy and  in some cases  expensive 
there can be no assurance that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals  the loss of previously received approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company manufactures and distributes a broad spectrum of respiratory therapy equipment  emergency medical equipment and medical gas equipment 
to date  all of the company s fda clearances have been obtained through the k clearance process 
these determinations are very fact specific and the fda has stated that  initially  the manufacturer is best qualified to make these determinations  which should be based on adequate supporting data and documentation 
the fda however  may disagree with a manufacturer s determination not to file a k and require the submission of a new k notification for the changed or modified device 
where the fda believes that the change or modification raises significant new questions of safety or effectiveness  the agency may require a manufacturer to cease distribution of the device pending clearance of a new k notification 
certain of the company s medical devices have been changed or modified subsequent to k marketing 
table of contents clearance of the original device by the fda 
certain of the company s medical devices  which were first marketed prior to may   and therefore  grandfathered and exempt from the k notification process  also have been subsequently changed or modified 
the company believes that these changes or modifications do not significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness  or make a major change or modification in the devices intended uses and  accordingly  submission of new k notification to the fda is not required 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with the company s determinations 
in addition  commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is subject to additional regulatory requirements and receipt of approvals that vary widely from country to country 
the company believes it is in compliance with regulatory requirements of the countries in which it sells its products 
the medical device reporting regulation requires that the company provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the medical device tracking regulation requires the company to adopt a method of device tracking of certain devices  such as ventilators  which are life supporting or life sustaining devices used outside of a device user facility  some of which are permanently implantable devices 
the regulation requires that the method adopted by the company will ensure that the tracked device can be traced from the device manufacturer to the person for whom the device is indicated ie  the patient 
in addition  the fda prohibits a company from promoting an approved device for unapproved applications and reviews a company s labeling for accuracy 
labeling and promotional activities also are in certain instances  subject to scrutiny by the federal trade commission 
the company s medical device manufacturing facilities are registered with the fda  and have received iso certification for the st 
louis facility and certification per the medical device directive mdd european for certain products in as such  the company will be audited by the fda  iso  and european auditors for compliance with the good manufacturing practices gmp  the iso and mdd regulations for medical devices 
these regulations require the company to manufacture its products and maintain its products and documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to design  manufacturing  testing and control activities 
the company also is subject to the registration and inspection requirements of state regulatory agencies 
there can be no assurance that any required fda or other governmental approval will be granted  or  if granted  will not be withdrawn 
governmental regulation may prevent or substantially delay the marketing of the company s proposed products and cause the company to undertake costly procedures 
in addition  the extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future administrative action or legislation cannot be predicted 
any failure to obtain  or delay in obtaining  such approvals could adversely affect the company s ability to market its proposed products 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
medical products shipped to the european community require ce certification 
the letters ce are an abbreviation of conformit europ enne  french for european conformity 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a device by a comparable regulatory authority of a foreign country generally must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing in those countries 
the time required to obtain such approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
in addition  fda approval may be required under certain circumstances to export certain medical devices 
the company has also received iso certification for medical device manufacturers in the company is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protections  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
patents  trademarks and proprietary technology the company owns and maintains patents on several products it believes is useful to the business and provides the company with an advantage over its competitors 
during fiscal the company was granted a us patent on the xtra backboard 
the company continues to pursue patents on the construction alarm and several other products under development 

table of contents the company owns and maintains us trademark registrations for chemetron  gomco  oxequip  lif o gen  life support products  timeter  vacutron and schuco  its principal trademarks 
registrations for these trademarks are also owned and maintained in countries where such products are sold and such registrations are considered necessary to preserve the company s proprietary rights therein 
competition the company has different competitors within each of its product lines 
many of the company s principal competitors are larger than allied and the company believes that most of these competitors have greater financial and other resources 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality and service 
the company believes that it is well positioned with respect to product cost  brand recognition  product reliability  and customer service to compete effectively in each of its markets 
employees at june   the company had approximately full time employees 
approximately employees in the company s principal manufacturing facility located in st 
louis  missouri  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on may  on august   allied entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories abbott pursuant to which allied agreed to cease production of its product baralyme  and to affect the withdrawal of baralyme product held by distributors 
the agreement permits allied to pursue the development of a new carbon dioxide absorbent product 
baralyme  a carbon dioxide absorbent product  has been used safely and effectively in connection with inhalation anesthetics since its introduction in the s 
in recent years  the number of inhalation anesthetics has increased  giving rise to concerns regarding the use of baralyme in conjunction with these newer inhalation anesthetics if baralyme has been allowed  contrary to recommended practice  to become desiccated 
the agreement also provides that  for a period of eight years  allied will not manufacture  distribute  promote  market  sell  commercialize or donate any baralyme product or similar product based upon potassium hydroxide and will not develop or license any new carbon dioxide absorbent product containing potassium hydroxide 
more detailed information concerning this agreement is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on september  allied entered into a closedown agreement with the international chemical union representing the employees at the stuyvesant falls  new york facility 
the company had advised the union that the plant will be closed and all bargaining unit employees related to such operation would be permanently laid off  no later than october  the collective bargaining agreement expired and was terminated as of the closing date 
the company paid severance to those bargaining unit employees on the active payroll as of august  environmental and safety regulation the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
the company is also subject to the federal occupational safety and health act and similar state statutes 
from time to time the company has been involved in environmental proceedings involving clean up of hazardous waste 
there are no such material proceedings currently pending 
costs of compliance with environmental  health and safety requirements have not been material to the company 
the company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
item a 
risk factors the company s business  operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k and in the company s other filings with the sec  before making any investment decision with respect to the company s securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also affect the company s business 
if any of these known or unknown 
table of contents risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could change 
the company participates in a highly competitive environment 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions 
our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
we face intense competition from other manufacturers 
some of our competitors may be larger than we are and may have greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we believe that price competition will continue among products developed in our markets 
our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do 
such developments could have a significant negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if we are able to compete successfully  we may not be able to do so in a profitable manner 
decreased availability or increased costs of raw materials could increase the company s costs of producing its products 
the company purchases raw materials  fabricated components and services from a variety of suppliers 
raw materials such as brass and plastics are considered key raw materials 
the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are satisfactory and that alternative sources of supply are readily available 
from time to time  however  the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to global market demands  which could impair the company s ability to procure necessary materials  or increase the cost of such materials 
inflationary and other increases in costs of these raw materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time 
in addition  freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
a reduction in the supply or increase in the cost of those raw materials could impact the company s ability to manufacture its products and could increase the cost of production 
changes in third party reimbursement could negatively impact the company s revenues and profitability 
the cost of a majority of medical care in the united states is funded by the us government through the medicare and medicaid programs and by private insurance programs  such as corporate health insurance plans 
although the company does not receive payments for its products directly from these programs  home respiratory care providers and durable medical equipment suppliers  who are the primary customers for several of the company s products  depend heavily on payments from medicare  medicaid and private insurers as a major source of revenues 
in addition  sales of certain of the company s products are affected by the extent of hospital and health care facility construction and renovation at any given time 
the federal government indirectly funds a significant percentage of such construction and renovation costs through medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
in recent years  governmentally imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals and other health care providers have impacted spending for services  consumables and capital goods 
a material decrease from current reimbursement levels or a material change in the method or basis of reimbursing health care providers is likely to adversely affect future sales of the company s products 
our success depends upon the development of new products and product enhancements  which entails considerable time and expense 
we place a high priority on the development of new products to add to our product portfolio and on the development of enhancements to our existing products 
product development involves substantial expense and we cannot be certain that a completed product will generate sufficient revenue for our business to justify the resources that we devote to research and development related to such product 
the time and expense required to develop new products and product enhancements is difficult to predict and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in developing  introducing and marketing new products and product enhancements 
our inability to successfully develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis or at all  or to achieve market acceptance of such products  could materially impair our business 

table of contents we are dependent on adequate protection of our patent and proprietary rights 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  copyrights  know how  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
however  these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors 
we cannot assure you that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets 
our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and may make substantial investments in competing technologies  may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit  or interfere with our ability to manufacture or market our products 
further  while we do not believe that any of our products or processes interfere with the rights of others  third parties may nonetheless assert patent infringement claims against us in the future 
costly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how we own  to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership  scope  or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others 
any claim of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties  and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling  or using our products 
the occurrence of this litigation or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business of the manufacturing  marketing  and sale of medical devices involves the risk of liability claims and such claims could seriously harm our business  particularly if our insurance coverage is inadequate 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of medical devices 
like other participants in the medical device market  we are from time to time involved in lawsuits  claims and proceedings alleging product liability and related claims such as negligence 
if any current or future product liability claims become substantial  our reputation could be damaged significantly  thereby harming our business 
we may be required to pay substantial damage awards as a result of any successful product liability claims 
any product liability claim against us  whether with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  and divert the time  attention  and resources of our management 
as a result of our exposure to product liability claims  we currently carry product liability insurance covering our products with policy limits per occurrence and in the aggregate that we have deemed to be sufficient 
our insurance may not cover certain product liability claims or our liability for any claims may exceed our coverage limits 
therefore  we cannot predict whether this insurance is sufficient  or if not  whether we will be able to obtain sufficient insurance to cover the risks associated with our business or whether such insurance will be available at premiums that are commercially reasonable 
in addition  these insurance policies must be renewed annually 
although we have been able to obtain liability insurance  such insurance may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim against us or settlement by us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage  or our inability to maintain insurance in the future  or any claim that results in significant costs to or adverse publicity against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to substantial domestic and international government regulation  including regulatory quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes 
failure by the company to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the fda regulates the approval  manufacturing  and sales and marketing of many of the company s products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada  japan  europe  and other countries in which the company conducts business 
as a device manufacturer  the company is required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda s quality system regulation qsr 
table of contents requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require the company to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
in the european community  the company is required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell its products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns  product recalls or related field actions  product shortages or delays in product manufacturing 
efficacy or safety concerns  an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace  and or manufacturing quality issues with respect to the company s products could lead to product recalls or related field actions  withdrawals  and or declining sales 
our products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving fda clearance or approval  which would harm our reputation and our business 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which our products are sold  have the authority to request and  in some cases  require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects 
any recall of product would divert managerial and financial resources  harm our reputation with our customers and damage our business 
the company is exposed to certain credit risks  resulting primarily from customer sales 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from homecare providers  distributors  hospitals  and contractors 
the company s customers are located throughout the us and around the world 
the company records an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based primarily on the company s evaluation of the payment pattern  financial condition  cash flows  and credit history of its customers as well as current industry and economic conditions 
the company s inability to collect on its trade accounts receivable could substantially reduce the company s income and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variation in our operating results  announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors  and other events or factors 
for example  a shortfall in net sales or net income  or an increase in losses could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many micro and small capitalization companies and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline 
the company has one principal manufacturing operation 
in the event that this facility  located in st 
louis  missouri  were severely damaged or destroyed as a result of a natural or man made disaster  the company would be forced to relocate production to other facilities and or rely on third party manufacturers 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business  this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents requirements associated with the evaluation of internal controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of have required and will require significant company resources and management attention 
although we believe that we are currently in compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  we may in the future identify material deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate on a timely basis 
if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  we could be subject to scrutiny by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq national market  and the trading price of our stock could decline 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping us to prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly 
if we are unable to hire or retain key employees  it could have a negative impact on our business 
our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder the management of our business  our research and development  our sales and marketing efforts  and our manufacturing capabilities 
however  there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to hire or retain key employees 
we compete to hire new employees  and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies 
our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 
any unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage
