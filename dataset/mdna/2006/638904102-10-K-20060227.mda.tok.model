item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see note on forward looking statements and risk factors for more information 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an international insurance holding company focusing on specialty products for niches within the overall property casualty insurance market 
our largest product line and most long standing area of specialization is ocean marine insurance 
we have also developed specialty niches in professional liability insurance  and in specialty liability insurance primarily consisting of contractors liability coverages 
we conduct operations through the insurance companies  the navigators agencies and our lloyd s operations 
the insurance companies consist of navigators insurance company  which includes a united kingdom branch  and nic insurance company which writes excess and surplus lines 
the navigators agencies consist of five wholly owned insurance underwriting agencies which produce business for the insurance companies and unaffiliated insurers 
our lloyd s operations include nual  a lloyd s marine underwriting agency which manages lloyd s syndicate we participate in the capacity of syndicate through two wholly owned lloyd s corporate members 
while management takes into consideration a wide range of factors in planning the company s business strategy and evaluating results of operations  there are certain factors that management believes are fundamental to understanding how the company is managed 
first  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as a primary goal  above premium growth 
management s assessment of our trends and potential growth in underwriting profit is the dominant factor in its decisions with respect to whether or not to expand a business line  enter into a new niche  product or territory or  conversely  to contract capacity in any business line 
in addition  management focuses on managing the costs of our operations 
management believes that careful monitoring of the costs of existing operations and assessment of costs of potential growth opportunities are important to our profitability 
access to capital also has a significant impact on management s outlook for our operations 
our insurance company subsidiaries operations and ability to grow their business and take advantage of market opportunities are particularly constrained by regulatory capital requirements and rating agency assessments of capital adequacy 
for example  we contributed million of the approximately million in net proceeds we received from our october equity offering and we contributed million of the approximately million in net proceeds we received from our october equity offering to the statutory surplus of navigators insurance company in order to position the company to be able to capitalize on domestic and international insurance business opportunities that management believes will be profitable 
the discussions that follow include tables  which contain both our consolidated and segment operating results for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in presenting our financial results we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting results which is a non gaap measure and the related combined ratio which is another non gaap measure of underwriting profitability 
we consider such measures  which may be defined differently by other companies  to be important in the understanding of our overall results of operations 
underwriting profit or loss is calculated from premiums earned  less net losses and lae  commission expense and other operating expenses related to underwriting activities 
the combined ratio is derived by taking such net losses and lae and expenses divided by earned premiums 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit and over indicates an underwriting loss 
a n n u a l r e p o r t although not a financial measure  management s decisions are also greatly influenced by access to specialized underwriting and claims expertise in our lines of business 
we have chosen to operate in specialty niches with certain common characteristics which we believe provide us with the opportunity to use our technical underwriting expertise in order to realize underwriting profit 
as a result  we have focused on underserved markets for businesses characterized by higher severity and low frequency of loss where we believe our intellectual capital and financial strength bring meaningful value 
in contrast  we have avoided niches that we believe have a high frequency of loss activity and or are subject to a high level of regulatory coverage requirements  such as workers compensation and personal automobile insurance  because we do not believe our technical expertise is of as much value in these types of businesses 
examples of niches that have the characteristics we look for include bluewater hull which provides coverage for physical damage to  for example  highly valued cruise ships and directors and officers liability which covers litigation exposure of a corporation s directors and officers 
these types of exposures require substantial technical expertise 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of severe claims on our results by conservative and detailed underwriting  prudent use of reinsurance and a balanced portfolio of risks 
our revenue is primarily comprised of premiums  commission and investment income 
our insurance company subsidiaries derive their premiums primarily from business written by the navigators agencies 
the lloyd s operations derive their premiums from business written by nual 
the navigators agencies and nual receive commissions and  in some cases  profit commissions and service fees on the business produced on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries and others 
over the past three years  we have experienced generally beneficial market changes in our lines of business 
as a result of several large industry losses in the second quarter of  the marine insurance market began to experience diminished capacity and rate increases  initially in the offshore energy line of business 
the marine rate increases began to level off in and into as a result of substantial insurance industry losses resulting from hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september of  the marine insurance market is experiencing diminished capacity and rate increases  particularly for the gulf of mexico offshore energy line of business 
specialty liability losses  particularly from our california construction liability business  also resulted in diminished capacity in the market in which we compete  as many former competitors who lacked the expertise to selectively underwrite this business have been forced to withdraw from the market 
rates for the california construction liability business leveled off in the first six months and began to decline in the second half of after rate increases in and in the professional liability market  the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of  together with recent financial and accounting scandals at publicly traded corporations and the increased frequency of securities related class action litigation  has led to heightened interest in professional liability insurance generally 
these conditions resulted in rate increases in and as well as an overall improvement in policy terms and conditions for our professional liability line of business 
the professional liability renewal business written by the company experienced low single digit premium rate decreases in and relatively level rates in our business is cyclical and influenced by many factors 
these factors include price competition  the availability and cost of reinsurance  economic conditions  interest rates  weather related events and other catastrophes including natural and man made disasters for example hurricanes and terrorism  state regulations  court decisions and changes in the law 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
although we will attempt to manage our exposure to such events  the frequency and severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
additionally  because our insurance products must be priced  and premiums charged  before costs have fully developed  our liabilities are required to be estimated and recorded in recognition of future loss and settlement obligations 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating these liabilities  we cannot assure you that our actual liabilities will not exceed our recorded amounts 
for additional information regarding our business  see business general 
a n n u a l r e p o r t catastrophe risk management our insurance companies and lloyd s operations have exposure to losses caused by hurricanes and other natural and man made catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe exposed areas globally and attempt to manage this exposure through individual risk selection and through the purchase of reinsurance 
we also use modeling technologies and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses from catastrophe exposures 
despite these efforts  there remains uncertainty about the characteristics  timing and extent of insured losses given the nature of catastrophes 
the occurrence of one or more severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
as a result of the offshore energy losses suffered by the marine and energy market in stemming from hurricanes katrina and rita  the marine reinsurance capacity has declined  reinsurance terms and conditions have tightened and reinsurance costs have dramatically increased  particularly for excess of loss reinsurance protection 
as a result  while the company expects to achieve significant improvements in pricing  terms and conditions for the offshore energy business in and reduce its aggregate loss exposures in the gulf of mexico  it will have an increased net retention for a catastrophic offshore energy loss as a result of less available reinsurance protection at an increased reinsurance cost 
the occurrence of additional large loss events could reduce the reinsurance coverage that is available to us and could further weaken the financial condition of our reinsurers  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
although the reinsurance agreements make the reinsurers liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer  ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims to our policyholders 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
specifically  our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis  or they may not pay some or all of these claims 
either of these events would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are required to pay the losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement 
hurricanes katrina and rita increased our reinsurance recoverables significantly  which increased our credit risk 
hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma hurricanes katrina and rita which occurred in the third quarter generated substantial losses to the property and casualty industry and the marine and energy insurance market due principally to offshore energy losses 
hurricane wilma  which occurred in the fourth quarter  also generated substantial losses to the property and casualty industry but was not significant to either the marine and energy line of business or to the company in general  in comparison to hurricanes katrina and rita 
a n n u a l r e p o r t the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on our financial results follow hurricane katrina hurricane rita total in thousands reduction in net earned premiums for reinstatement costs  gross losses incurred    reinsurance recoverable    net losses incurred    underwriting loss    after tax net loss    reduction in earnings per share effect on combined ratio loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio on august   hurricane katrina struck louisiana  mississippi  alabama and surrounding areas  causing significant destruction in those areas 
our estimate of after tax net losses  inclusive of expected reinsurance recoveries and related reinsurance reinstatement premiums  is approximately million or per share for the year 
our estimate of net losses related to hurricane katrina was developed from a combination of preliminary claims notifications received from brokers and insureds  portfolio modeling based upon the storm track of hurricane katrina and the company s own internal assessment of the exposures insured under individual policies 
a substantial portion of the company s estimated loss is due to offshore energy exposures in the gulf of mexico 
based upon management s estimate of ultimate loss  we believe that the company s gross claims are contained within our reinsurance program 
our actual losses from hurricane katrina may differ materially from our estimated losses as a result of  among other things  the receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers  the attribution of losses to coverages that for the purpose of our estimates we assumed would not be exposed and inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials 
if our actual losses from hurricane katrina are materially greater than our estimated losses  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
on september   hurricane rita struck texas and louisiana  causing significant destruction in those areas 
our estimate of after tax net losses  inclusive of expected reinsurance recoveries and related reinsurance reinstatement premiums  is approximately million or per share for the year 
our estimate of net losses related to hurricane rita was developed from a combination of preliminary claims notifications received from brokers and insureds  portfolio modeling based upon the storm track of hurricane rita and the company s own internal assessment of the exposures insured under individual policies 
a substantial portion of the company s estimated loss is due to offshore energy exposures in the gulf of mexico 
based upon management s current estimate of ultimate loss  we believe that the company s gross claims are contained within our reinsurance program 
our actual losses from hurricane rita may ultimately differ materially from our estimated losses as a result of  among other things  the receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers  the attribution of losses to coverages that for the purpose of our estimates we assumed would not be exposed and inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials 
if our actual losses from hurricane rita are materially greater than our estimated losses  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
a n n u a l r e p o r t approximately of the gross losses incurred for hurricanes katrina and rita were generated by our lloyd s operations from assumed excess of loss marine reinsurance  a substantial portion of which was retroceded 
a large portion of this assumed reinsurance was not renewed in industry investigations the insurance industry has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and certain sales practices 
during  the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed  and the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes 
these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industry wide practices or legislation  rules or regulations that could significantly affect our industry and may also cause stock price volatility for companies in the insurance industry 
the company has completed its own internal review with respect to such contingent commission arrangements and the anti competitive sales practices discussed above 
in this internal inquiry  the company did not find any evidence that it has engaged in the bid rigging and price fixing activities that are at the core of the industry investigations into these anti competitive practices 
the company is supportive of industry efforts to encourage transparency in the disclosure of contingent commissions paid to brokers by insurers 
the reinsurance industry has also become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to the alleged improper use of reinsurance agreements to manipulate financial reporting results 
the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings related to reinsurance agreements in which the insurance risk transferred between the ceding company and reinsurer may have been insufficient to properly account for such transactions as reinsurance in financial statements filed with insurance regulatory authorities and the sec 
such transactions may include separate or side agreements that reduce  limit or mitigate the indemnification against loss or liability relating to the insurance risk transferred to the reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement 
as a result of these industry investigations  accounting and reporting requirements for reinsurance transactions  including risk transfer guidance used to determine when sufficient insurance risk has been transferred by the ceding company to properly account for such transactions as reinsurance  may change 
the company believes that all of its reinsurance transactions meet the risk transfer requirements to be accounted for as prospective reinsurance in its financial statements  and also believes it has no separate side agreements that would limit the insurance risk transferred to the reinsurer under its reinsurance agreements 
the company is unable to determine any reinsurance industry financial reporting changes that could occur as a result of such investigations and the effects  if any  on its financial reporting of reinsurance transactions 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the period being reported upon 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
a n n u a l r e p o r t our most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of the reserves for losses and lae including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  written and unearned premium  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the impairment of invested assets  accounting for lloyd s results and the translation of foreign currencies 
reserves for losses and lae 
reserves for losses and lae represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
actuarial methodologies are employed to assist in establishing such estimates and include judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors which are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process  the ultimate liability may be different from the original estimate 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
additional information regarding our loss reserves can be found in results of operations operating expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  business reserves  and note to our consolidated audited financial statements  all of which are included herein 
reinsurance recoverables 
reinsurance recoverables are established for the portion of the reserves for losses and lae that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based upon the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
additional information regarding our reinsurance recoverables can be found in the business reinsurance ceded section and note to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
written and unearned premium 
written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
additional information regarding our written and unearned premium can be found in notes and to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
substantially all of our business is placed through agents and brokers 
since the vast majority of the company s gross written premium is primary or direct as opposed to assumed direct in  in and in the delays in reporting assumed premium generally do not have a significant effect on the company s financial statements  since we record estimates for both unreported direct and assumed premium 
we also record the ceded portion of the estimated gross written premium and related acquisition costs 
the earned gross  ceded and net premiums are calculated based on our earning methodology which is generally pro rata over the policy periods 
losses are also recorded in relation to the earned premium 
the estimate for losses incurred on the estimated premium is based on an actuarial calculation consistent with the methodology used to determine incurred but not reported loss reserves for reported premiums 
a portion of the company s premium is estimated for unreported premium  mostly for the marine business written by our uk branch and lloyd s operations 
we generally do not experience any significant backlog in processing premiums 
of the million of gross written premium recorded in  million or was estimated 
the estimated premium was of the gross written premium in both and such premium estimates are generally based on submission data received from brokers and agents and recorded when the insurance policy or reinsurance contract is bound and written 
the a n n u a l r e p o r t estimates are regularly reviewed and updated taking into account the premium received to date versus the estimate and the age of the estimate 
to the extent that the actual premium varies from the estimates  the difference  along with the related loss reserves and underwriting expenses  is recorded in current operations 
deferred tax assets 
we apply the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
additional information regarding our deferred tax assets can be found in notes and to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
impairment of investment securities 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
in general  we focus our attention on those securities whose market value was less than of their cost or amortized cost  as appropriate  for six or more consecutive months 
factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  the current fair value as compared to cost or amortized cost of the security  as appropriate  the length of time the investment has been below cost or amortized cost and by how much  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
significant changes in the factors we consider when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
for additional detail regarding our investment portfolio at december  and  including disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value  see the business investments section and note to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
accounting for lloyd s results 
we record our pro rata share of lloyd s syndicate assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  after making adjustments to convert lloyd s accounting to us gaap 
the most significant gaap adjustments relate to income recognition 
lloyd s syndicates determine underwriting results by year of account at the end of three years 
we record adjustments to recognize underwriting results as incurred  including the expected ultimate cost of losses incurred 
these adjustments to losses are based on actuarial analysis of syndicate accounts  including forecasts of expected ultimate losses provided by the syndicate 
at the end of the lloyd s three year period for determining underwriting results for an account year  the syndicate will close the account year by reinsuring outstanding claims on that account year with the participants for the account s next underwriting year 
the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close the ritc 
the ritc transaction is recorded in the fourth quarter as additional written and earned premium  losses incurred  loss reserves and receivables  all in the same amount 
there are no gains or losses recorded on the ritc transaction 
additional information regarding our accounting for lloyd s results can be found in note to our consolidated audited financial statements  included herein 
a n n u a l r e p o r t translation of foreign currencies 
financial statements of subsidiaries expressed in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation issued by the fasb 
under sfas  functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using period end rates of exchange and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment 
statement of income amounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in other income expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
results of operations and overview the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated and segment results of operations for the years ended december   and all earnings per share data is presented on a per diluted share basis 
net income for  and was million or per share  million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
the year was adversely impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita and the year was adversely impacted by reserve strengthening from prior years 
when excluding the storm losses in and prior year reserve strengthening for asbestos in  underwriting profitability during such periods  as measured by the company s combined ratios  has also improved for the  and business written 
this improvement in underwriting profitability reflects increasing premium rates as a result of favorable market conditions beginning in late and continuing to a lesser extent through  and then leveling off in except for marine offshore energy rates which increased in the fourth quarter as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
we experienced premium growth as measured by net earned premium in  and of  and  respectively  due to the combination of increased premium rates and business expansion 
cash flow from operations increased in and by approximately and  respectively  contributing to the growth in invested assets and net investment income 
investment income increased in to million compared to as the result of both the increase in invested assets and the increase in yield 
the growth in investment income of compared to was due to the increase in invested assets 
the investment income increase was somewhat mitigated in compared to  as a result of the overall declines in interest rates in the investment portfolio and the broader financial market 
results the results of operations reflect improved financial performance consistent with the year excluding hurricane losses 
the results of operations were adversely impacted by an after tax charge of million or per share from the losses resulting from hurricanes katrina and rita 
the company s combined ratio of was negatively impacted by points from hurricanes katrina and rita while being reduced by loss ratio points for a net redundancy of prior year loss reserves of million 
during october  the company enhanced its financial position and ability to take advantage of market opportunities for its insurance operations by contributing million of the million of the net proceeds from its equity offering to the statutory surplus of the insurance companies 
investment income increased as pre tax investment yields rose to in compared to in and as the result of investing the cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the october equity offering in an investment environment where interest rates were fluctuating but generally increasing as the result of tightening monetary policy 
a n n u a l r e p o r t results the results of operations reflect improved financial performance compared to and due to a combination of improved underwriting results and the growth in net investment income 
the underwriting results benefited from the improved market conditions as reflected in increased premium rates coupled with the recording of a net redundancy of prior year loss reserve of million which reduced the combined ratio of by loss ratio points 
while pre tax investment yields declined to in compared to in  net investment income increased due to the cash flow from operations coupled with the net proceeds of the company s october equity offering 
results the results of operations were adversely impacted by an after tax charge of million or per diluted share for incurred losses related to asbestos exposures 
the company s combined ratio of was negatively impacted by percentage points for incurred losses related to asbestos and environmental exposures 
navigators insurance company increased its gross and net asbestos reserves for losses by million and million  respectively  in the fourth quarter of as a result  gross and net incurred losses increased by the amount of the respective reserve increase 
the reserve action was the result of a review of asbestos related exposures conducted by the company and an independent consulting firm 
following such review  the company increased its gross and net loss reserves for asbestos exposure to million and million  respectively  at december  during october  the company enhanced its financial position and ability to take advantage of market opportunities as a result of the net proceeds of million from its equity offering by paying off its remaining outstanding debt  contributing million to the statutory surplus of navigators insurance company and increasing its stamp capacity at lloyd s by increasing its letter of credit facility 
revenues 
gross written premium increased to million or in from million in  and by from million in the growth in gross premiums over the three year period reflects a combination of business expansion in both new and existing lines of business coupled with premium rate changes on renewal policies 
the premium rate increases or decreases as noted below for marine  specialty and professional liability are calculated primarily by comparing premium amounts on policies that have renewed 
the premiums are judgmentally adjusted for exposure factors when deemed significant and sometimes represent an aggregation of several lines of business 
the rate change calculations provide an indicated pricing trend and are not meant to be a precise analysis of the numerous factors that affect premium rates or the adequacy of such rates to cover all underwriting costs and generate an underwriting profit 
the calculation can also be affected quarter by quarter depending on the particular policies and the number of policies that renew during that period 
due to market conditions  these rate changes may or may not apply to new business which may be more competitively priced a n n u a l r e p o r t compared to renewal business 
the following table sets forth our gross and net written premium and net earned premium by segment and line of business for the periods indicated year ended december  gross written premium net written premium net earned premium gross written premium net written premium net earned premium gross written premium net written premium net earned premium in thousands insurance companies marine     specialty     professional liability     assumed from lloyd s    other includes run off insurance companies total    lloyd s operations marine     professional liability    other      lloyd s operations total    intercompany elimination   total     gross written premium insurance companies gross written premium marine premium

the marine gross written premium for increased compared to due to growth across several lines of business including cargo  offshore energy and liability 
during  we also began to insure customs bonds 
the average marine renewal premium rates during were relatively flat over the first nine months and then increased approximately in the fourth quarter following hurricanes katrina and rita resulting in an approximate average increase for the year 
the marine gross written premium increased principally due to the addition of protection and indemnity business written by our uk branch commencing early in the year coupled with the average increase in renewal premium rates during the year 
primary marine protection and indemnity p i business complements our marine liability business which is generally written above the primary layer on an excess basis 
the rate increases in the marine business slowed in compared to the prior two years 
rate increases in averaged approximately 
navigators insurance company obtains its marine business through participation in the marine pool managed by the navigators agencies 
its participation in the marine pool was in and in both and commencing in  the marine pool has been eliminated and  therefore  all of the marine business generated by the navigators agencies will be exclusively for navigators insurance company 
a n n u a l r e p o r t specialty premium 
the business consists of general liability business for small general and artisan contractors  personal umbrella business  excess casualty and other targeted commercial risks 
the gross written premium increased when compared to reflecting growth across all lines of business and premiums generated from our excess casualty business  which started in the first quarter of during we expanded our presence in the hospitality business by writing general liability insurance which includes liquor law liability coverage for commercial establishments such as bars  restaurants and night clubs 
we also commenced writing first party personal lines warranty coverage on underground fuel tanks excluding pollution coverage 
the specialty premium increased in compared to due to increased rates and underwriting new policies 
the average renewal rate changes in the contractors liability business decreased approximately in following increases of and in and  respectively 
during and  the number of california construction liability in force policies decreased significantly as a result of our efforts to scale back the number of small artisan policies we write 
the new business and the rate increases resulted from a tightening market for california contractors liability insurance 
professional liability premium 
our insurance company subsidiaries write professional liability insurance  of which represents directors and officers liability insurance d o for privately held and publicly traded corporations  represents professional liability coverage in lawyers and other professionals and represents professional liability coverage for architects and engineers 
in  the professional liability business was expanded to include errors and omissions insurance and employment practices liability coverages 
commencing in october  our uk branch began writing professional liability coverages for uk solicitors and  in  we began writing professional liability coverages for architects and engineers 
the professional liability premium increased to million in from million and in compared to million in reflecting growth and the expansion of this business for all lines 
renewal premium rates for this business were relatively level in after decreasing approximately in compared to increases of approximately in d o rates decreased approximately in and in these premium rate decreases were reflective of softening market conditions which may continue into assumed from lloyd s operations

ceded written premium 
in the ordinary course of business  we reinsure certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting our maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses  and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
the relationship of ceded to written premium varies based upon the types of business written and whether the business is written by the insurance companies or our lloyd s operations 
a n n u a l r e p o r t the following table sets forth our ceded written premium by segment and major line of business for the periods indicated ceded written premium of gross written premium ceded written premium of gross written premium ceded written premium of gross written premium in thousands insurance companies marine    specialty    professional liability    assumed from lloyd s nm nm nm other includes run off nm nm nm subtotal    lloyd s operations marine    professional liability  other    subtotal    intercompany elimination    total    the increases in the total dollar amount ceded each year were primarily due to the increases in the gross written premium

the insurance companies marine and lloyd s operations ceded written premium includes million and million  respectively  of reinstatement premium related to the losses from hurricane ivan 
excluding the effects of ceded reinstatement premiums on both and  the ratios of ceded written premium to gross written premium were and  respectively 
the percentage decrease in is principally due to three factors the march  cancellation of a quota share reinsurance agreement for the specialty business  navigators insurance company s increased participation in the marine pool to in compared to in and  and a gross and ceded reduced ritc transaction amount in compared to the ceded written premium percentage was for marine business  which includes percentage points of ceded reinstatement premiums  compared to for principally due to the company s increased participation in the marine pool 
the increase to for marine business ceded premium  compared to in reflects increased purchases of quota share reinsurance for certain marine classes of business  net reinstatement premium costs of million for hurricane ivan losses which added percentage points to the ceded written premium percentage and an overall increase in excess of loss reinsurance premium since a n n u a l r e p o r t the decrease in ceded premium to in compared to in for our navigators specialty operations resulted from cancellation of the specialty quota share agreement as of march  while the increase to for specialty business ceded premium  compared to in  is principally due to the purchase of the quota share treaty in coupled with rate increases for an excess of loss reinsurance treaty 
the cancellation of the quota share agreement on the specialty business resulted in a reduction of approximately million in ceded written and unearned premium and an increase in net written premium in the first quarter 
this amount was retained by the company and is being earned over a to month period 
the net written premium is net of approximately million of ceded written premium related to this quota share agreement 
the percentage of ceded premium for professional liability business has declined each year since the company is retaining more of its risks on a net basis as the business grows and becomes more seasoned 
the percentage of ceded premium in our lloyd s operations decreased to  or when excluding the million of reinstatement premium related to the losses from hurricanes katrina and rita 
the ceded premium amount for the lloyd s operations includes million or of syndicate gross written premium in connection with the ritc transaction of which million was assumed by navigators insurance company through a retrocession of the syndicate s reinsurance

commission income 
commission income from unaffiliated business increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase principally resulted from higher profit commission in the lloyd s operations on the closing of the year of account 
commission income from the navigators agencies decreased as the result of less profit commission due to the losses generated by hurricanes katrina and rita and the increase in navigators insurance company s participation in the marine pool to in from in the marine pool has been eliminated beginning with the underwriting year 
net investment income

the ratios of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred to net earned premium loss ratios were  and in  and  respectively 
the loss ratio of includes loss ratio points related to hurricanes katrina and rita 
the loss ratio was favorably impacted by loss ratio points resulting from the million net redundancy of prior year loss reserves 
the loss ratio increased by loss ratio points as a result of million of net losses and million of net reinstatement premiums from hurricane ivan 
the loss ratio was favorably impacted by loss ratio points resulting from the million net redundancy of prior year loss reserves 
the loss ratio in was adversely impacted by the asbestos losses recorded in the fourth quarter of which accounted for loss ratio points of the loss ratio and  to a lesser extent  the adverse development in the california contractors liability portion of the specialty business which accounted for loss ratio points and by loss ratio points for loss activity related to run off lines of business 
the improvements in the premium rates since have benefited the loss ratios each year 
we do not discount any of our loss reserves 
the provision for loss adjustment expenses includes defense cost containment expenses for outside adjustors  attorneys fees and internal operating expenses consisting principally of claims department costs incurred in the processing and settlement of claims 
commencing in  the company allocated paid claims department costs in losses incurred while previously such payments were included in other operating expenses 
such payments included in incurred losses for the year were million compared to million and million for and  respectively included in other operating expenses 
such reclassifications have no impact on net income and the combined loss and expense ratios for all current and prior periods 
the following table sets forth our net loss reserves by segment and line of insurance business and the total case reserves and ibnr as of the date indicated as of december  in thousands insurance companies marine    specialty    professional liability    assumed from lloyd s operations    other primarily run off business    total insurance companies    lloyd s operations marine    other    total lloyd s operations    total net loss reserves    total net case loss reserves    total net ibnr loss reserves    total net loss reserves    a n n u a l r e p o r t at december   the ibnr loss reserve was million or of our total loss reserves compared to in and in the increase in net loss reserves in all active lines of business is generally a reflection of the growth in premium volume over the last three years 
the marine net loss reserve increase for both the insurance companies and lloyd s operations also increased due to loss reserves established for hurricanes katrina and rita 
the increase in marine net loss reserves for the lloyd s operations also contains loss reserves assumed from reinsurers and the insurance companies in connection with the ritc transaction 
the company s overall gross loss reserves increased million to  million in and reinsurance receivables on paid and unpaid losses increased million to  million in in  the overall gross loss reserves increased million to million and reinsurance receivables on paid and unpaid losses increased million to million 
the increase in gross incurred losses on the company s and balance sheets primarily relates to incurred losses for events occurring in and approximately of the increase in the gross loss reserves and of the increase in reinsurance recoverables relate to hurricanes katrina and rita 
with the recording of gross losses  the company assesses its reinsurance coverage  potential receivables  and the recoverability of the receivables 
losses incurred on business recently written are primarily covered by reinsurance agreements written by companies with whom the company is currently doing reinsurance business and whose credit the company continues to assess in the normal course of business 
our reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect management s judgment concerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claims made against us 
no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
as discussed below and under the caption business loss reserves  there are a number of factors that could cause actual losses and loss adjustment expenses to differ materially from the amount that we have reserved for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into account many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
ibnr loss reserves are calculated by the company s actuaries using several standard actuarial methodologies  including the paid and incurred loss development and the paid and incurred bornheutter ferguson loss methods 
additional analyses  such as frequency severity analyses  are performed for certain books of business 
while an annual loss reserve study is conducted for each line of business  the timing of such studies varies throughout the year 
additionally  a review of the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations for each line of business is conducted each quarter 
a separate analysis is also performed annually and updated quarterly of our asbestos and environmental liability exposures 
any adjustments that result from this review are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
the actuarial methods generally utilize analysis of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses for each line of business by underwriting year 
this process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
this basic assumption is particularly relevant for our marine and energy business written by our insurance companies and lloyd s operations where we generally rely on the substantial loss development data accumulated over many years to establish ibnr loss reserves for immature underwriting years 
a n n u a l r e p o r t for certain long tail classes of business where anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns  estimates are based on both expected losses and actual reported losses 
these classes include our california contractors liability business and directors and officers liability business  among others 
for these classes  we set ultimate losses for each underwriting year reflecting several factors  including our evaluation of loss trends and the current risk environment 
the expected ultimate losses are adjusted as the underwriting year matures 
while we have a significant amount of loss development data that is utilized by our actuaries to establish the ibnr loss reserves for our california contractors liability business  there have been significant changes relating to this product and its market that could affect the applicability of our data 
for example  one factor that may affect reserves and claim frequency is legislation implemented in california  which generally provides consumers who experience construction defects a method other than litigation to obtain defect repairs 
the legislation and its potential impact is discussed in the business loss reserves section included herein 
accordingly  our ultimate liability may exceed or be less than current estimates due to this variable  among others 
the professional liability business generates third party claims which also are longer tail in nature 
the professional liability policies mostly provide coverage on a claims made basis  whereby coverage is generally provided only for those claims that are made during the policy period 
these claims often involve a lengthy litigation period after being reported 
our professional liability business is relatively immature  as we first began writing the business in late accordingly  it will take some time to better understand the reserve trends on this business 
given the limited history of this business  the actuaries generally utilize industry data to initially establish ibnr loss reserves  which are subsequently adjusted based on actual and expected claim emergence as each underwriting year matures 
at the start of each underwriting year  our actuaries and management determine an initial selected ultimate loss ratio for each line of business 
management participation generally includes the underwriter for the particular line of business  executive management  and claims and finance personnel 
generally  such determinations are based on prior year history modified where deemed appropriate for observed changes in premium rates  terms  conditions  exposures  and loss trends 
industry data is generally utilized for new lines of business 
as underwriting years age  for each subsequent quarter and following years  our actuaries  with management  continue to update and refine their estimates of selected ultimate loss ratios for each line of business  by underwriting year  using the actuarial methods referred to above and incorporating relevant factors that generally include actual loss development  recent claims activity  number and dollar amount of open claims  risk characteristics of the particular line of business  the potential effects of changes in underwriting and claims procedures  historic performance relative to expectations and the relationship of the ibnr reserve levels across underwriting years and between similar lines of business 
the output of this process results in refinements to the ultimate loss ratios 
such refinements to the ultimate loss ratios for the prior underwriting years generate prior year redundancies or deficiencies recorded in the year such refinements are made  as discussed below 
prior year reserve deficiencies redundancies of million  million and million were recorded in  and  respectively as discussed below 
the relevant factors that may have a significant impact on the establishment and adjustment of loss and lae reserves can vary by line of business and from period to period 
following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves 
the company has historically reserved for the professional liability business using ultimate loss ratios based on industry experience for this new line of business written since during  the insurance companies further reduced the reserves for such claims made policies compared to year end  by approximately million mostly all related to the and underwriting years 
the reductions were to recognize the low level of claim counts and continued favorable development compared to expectations at the time the reserves were initially established 
a n n u a l r e p o r t the insurance companies recorded million of prior year savings from business assumed from the lloyd s operations principally related to the underwriting year where loss reserves reductions were related to the reductions in premium estimates 
the company recorded  of prior year savings for run off business principally due to favorable loss experience on aviation business discontinued in the company recorded a prior year reserve deficiency of million for marine business principally due to an increase of approximately million for unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves offset by net favorable loss experience of million mostly related to the and prior underwriting years 
the company recorded a net prior year reserve deficiency of  for specialty business due to a limited amount of adverse development for a line of business discontinued in and california construction business offset by favorable development in specialty business written in the mid west 
the lloyd s operations recorded million of prior year savings mostly due to the favorable settlement of one large marine claim 
following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves 
during the insurance companies increased loss reserves for marine business for underwriting years and principally to recognize the increase in marine liability business written for those years which have a longer loss development pattern compared to the mix of marine business written in previous years 
commencing in  loss reserves for marine business were evaluated by product line 
prior to  such loss reserves were established in the aggregate for all marine products 
this refinement was the principal factor for the million prior year deficiency recorded in for marine business 
included in the incurred losses for specialty business was a series of claims aggregating to approximately million  from a single underwriting year policy that were all below the  attachment point of our year reinsurance program 
such unusual loss activity was the primary reason for the million of prior year loss deficiency recorded in for specialty business 
as discussed above  the company has historically reserved for the professional liability business using ultimate loss ratios based on industry experience for this relatively new line of business 
during the fourth quarter  the loss reserves for such claims made policies for underwriting years and were reduced by approximately million to recognize the low level of claim counts and favorable claims development compared to expectations at the time these reserves were initially established which were based on industry data 
during  ultimate loss ratios for our lloyd s operations were reduced for the and underwriting years for cargo  hull and the assumed marine excess of loss business mostly as a result of lower than expected claims activity coupled with the recognition of underwriting improvements for the business written for the underwriting year 
such factors were the principal reasons for the ultimate loss ratio reductions which occurred throughout the calendar year contributing to the million prior year savings recorded by our lloyd s operations and the million prior year savings recorded by our insurance companies for the business assumed from lloyd s 
following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves 
during  the insurance companies recorded for marine business adverse loss development approximating million for underwriting years to principally related to underestimates of loss reserves established for such periods 
offsetting such loss development were prior year savings of approximately million for underwriting years and due to the combination of favorable loss development and the reduction of tail factors and an additional net redundancy of million for all other underwriting years 
the tail factors were reduced in recognition that salvage and subrogation recoveries tend to a n n u a l r e p o r t mitigate loss development as underwriting years for marine business age and mature and losses become fully developed 
the combined effects of such items were the principal factors for the million of prior year loss reserve deficiencies recorded in for marine business 
incurred losses for specialty business included million of prior year reserve deficiencies due to adverse loss development and the lengthening of tail factors for underwriting years to substantially all of the reserve deficiencies related to the california contractors liability business  which has a long tail for the reporting and settlement of construction defect claims 
the company recorded million of prior year reserve deficiencies for run off business  mostly in the first half of such loss development was principally related to assumed reinsurance business discontinued in as discussed under business loss reserves gross and net loss reserves were increased in the fourth quarter by million and million  respectively  as a result of a review of asbestos exposures conducted by the company 
the million of net asbestos losses includes million of uncollectible reinsurance 
for the full year  the prior year loss reserve deficiency for asbestos and environmental exposures was million 
partially offsetting such prior year reserve deficiencies in was million of prior year savings from our lloyd s operations principally from the and underwriting years reflecting favorable loss development 
the company also employs outside actuaries to perform annual loss reserve studies of the insurance companies and lloyd s operations 
the results of such studies are used by the company to judge the reasonableness of the loss reserves recorded by the company 
there can be no assurance however that such outside actuarial studies provide greater reliability as to the adequacy of the company s loss reserves than the company s estimates given the inherent uncertainty of the loss reserve process coupled with the fact that such studies generally employ similar actuarial methods and the same company loss data 
we do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates 
we believe that ranges may not be a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves include interpreting loss development activity  emerging economic and social trends  inflation  changes in the regulatory and judicial environment and changes in our operations  including changes in underwriting standards and claims handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of industry wide emerging or potential claims and coverage issues 
these issues could have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of emerging or potential industry wide claims and coverage issues include increases in the number and size of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance and increases in the number and size of water damage claims related to remediation of mold conditions 
as a result of issues such as these  it has become increasingly difficult to estimate ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
the future impact of the various factors described above that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process and of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is extremely hard to predict and generally cannot be reliably quantified 
the company records as gross reserves the amount of losses to which it reasonably expects to have exposure and as net reserves that amount less what it reasonably expects to recover in reinsurance 
we review the loss reserves for each line of business we write as part of our overall analysis of loss reserves  taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular line of business 
the following sensitivity analysis with respect to possible a n n u a l r e p o r t significant variances from the company s expectations for net loss reserves  identifies and discusses the impact of changes in significant assumptions utilized to establish the company s loss reserves marine reserves for the insurance companies are established by product using the company s own historical experience adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends 
estimates of the ultimate liability could be redundant or deficient if the company s own experience is not appropriate for predicting future outcomes 
for example  this could occur if claims take longer to report than expected 
gross and net losses would increase by approximately million and million  respectively  if  on average  losses take longer to report than assumed for the marine business for reserves established at december  specialty reserves are established using the company s own experience and an industry based tail factor 
estimates of ultimate liability could be redundant or deficient if the company s own experience is not sufficiently predictive or if the industry tail factor is not representative of our future loss development 
a key assumption is the choice of tail factor for the construction liability book of business 
this is dominated by construction defect exposure  which has undergone significant recent changes in the underwriting  claims handling  legislation and liability environment 
if the construction tail after years is double our current expectations  then the gross and net losses would increase by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to construction liability reserves established at december  given the lack of sufficient historical experience  professional liability reserves are established using industry loss ratios and development patterns 
the ultimate loss ratio for an underwriting year is initially set to an industry average level 
expected loss emergence is then calculated using industry average development patterns  and expected emergence is replaced by actual experience as it emerges 
estimates of ultimate liability could be redundant or deficient if the industry selected ultimate loss ratios are inappropriate or if the industry development pattern is not representative of our book of business 
if the ultimate loss ratios for the professional liability business develop higher than the industry ultimate loss ratios used by our actuaries  then gross and net loss reserves would increase by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to the professional liability loss reserves established at december  commission expense 
commission expense paid to brokers and agents is generally based on a percentage of the gross written premium and is reduced by ceding commissions the company may receive on the ceded written premium 
commissions are generally deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs to the extent that they relate to unearned premium 
commission expense as a percentage of net earned premium was in  in and in other operating expenses 
the and increases in other operating expenses when comparing to and comparing to  respectively  are attributable primarily to employee related expenses resulting from expansion of the business coupled with the and costs incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of included in  and were   and  respectively  recorded for employee stock option expense 
the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as of january  interest expense 
the loan balance was paid in october from a portion of the proceeds from the company s common stock offering  therefore no interest expense was recorded in or income taxes 
the income tax expense benefit was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate is less than due to permanent differences between book and tax return income  the most significant item is tax exempt interest 
as of december  and  the net deferred federal  foreign  state and local tax assets were million and million  respectively 
a n n u a l r e p o r t we are subject to the tax regulations of the united states and foreign countries in which we operate 
the company files a consolidated federal tax return  which includes all domestic subsidiaries and the uk branch 
the income from the foreign operations is designated as either u 
s connected income and non us connected income 
lloyd s is required to pay non us income tax on us connected income us source income written by lloyd s syndicates 
lloyd s and the irs have entered into an agreement whereby the amount of tax due on us connected income is calculated by lloyd s and remitted directly to the irs 
these amounts are then charged to the corporate members in proportion to their participation in the relevant syndicates 
the company s corporate members are subject to this agreement and will receive uk tax credits for any uk income tax incurred up to the uk income tax charge on the uk income 
the uk connected insurance income would generally constitute taxable income under the subpart f income section of the internal revenue code since less than of the company s premium is derived within the uk and would therefore be subject to uk taxation when the lloyd s year of account closes 
taxes are accrued at a rate on our foreign source insurance income and foreign tax credits  where available  are utilized to offset us tax as permitted 
us taxes are not accrued on the earnings of the company s foreign agencies as these earnings are not subject to the subpart f tax regulations 
these earnings are subject to taxes under uk tax regulations at a rate 
we have not provided for us deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately million of our non us subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary 
however  in the future  if such earnings were distributed to the company  taxes of approximately million would be payable on such undistributed earnings and would be reflected in the tax provision for the year in which these earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary assuming all foreign tax credits are realized

our underwriting performance is evaluated separately from the performance of our investment portfolios 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations results are measured by taking into account net premiums earned  incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses  commission expense and other underwriting expenses 
the navigators agencies results include commission income less other operating expenses 
results of the parent and other operations include inter segment income and expense in the form of affiliated commissions  income and expense from corporate operations and consolidating adjustments 
each segment also maintains its own investments  on which it earns income and realizes capital gains or losses 
a n n u a l r e p o r t insurance companies our two insurance companies are navigators insurance company  which includes a united kingdom branch  and nic insurance company 
navigators insurance company is our largest insurance subsidiary and has been active since it specializes principally in underwriting marine insurance and related lines of business  specialty liability insurance and professional liability insurance 
nic insurance company  a wholly owned subsidiary of navigators insurance company  began operations in it underwrites similar types of business but on a non admitted or surplus lines basis and is fully reinsured by navigators insurance company

overall  the net earned premium increased  and in  and  respectively 
this growth is particularly pronounced in our specialty unit  where net earned premium grew when compared to  due to higher gross premiums and the increase in retained premium resulting from the cancellation of the specialty quota share treaty at march  the assumed premium from the lloyd s operations net earned premium includes million as a result of the ritc transaction recorded for the close of the year of account at syndicate the marine earned premium included approximately million as a result of a commutation agreement with a former pool member 
approximately nil  and of the net earned premium recorded in  and  respectively  is a result of the insurance companies participating on reinsurance treaties supporting the lloyd s operations marine and energy business 
a n n u a l r e p o r t the pre tax net loss to the insurance companies as the result of losses caused by hurricanes katrina and rita of approximately million  including million of reinstatement costs  increased the insurance companies combined ratio by ratio points as follows hurricane katrina hurricane rita total in thousands reduction in net earned premiums for reinstatement costs   gross losses incurred reinsurance recoverable    net losses incurred    underwriting loss    after tax net loss    reduction in earnings per share effect on combined ratio loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio the underwriting results were favorably impacted by approximately million or loss ratio points for net prior year savings of which million was for professional liability business  million for business assumed from our lloyd s operations and million for run off business  partially offset by deficiencies of million for marine business and million for specialty business 
the underwriting results benefited from improved market conditions since across all lines of business as reflected in the combined ratio 
the underwriting results were negatively impacted by approximately million or loss ratio points for net prior year loss development of which million was for marine business  million for specialty business and million for run off business  offset by million of prior year savings for professional liability business and million from business assumed from our lloyd s operations 
the net loss to the insurance companies from hurricane ivan of approximately million increased the marine combined ratio by ratio points and the insurance companies combined ratio by ratio points 
the underwriting results were adversely impacted by approximately million for incurred losses related to years prior to approximately million of such adverse development was for incurred losses recorded for asbestos and environmental exposures consisting of million in marine business and million in run off business 
as a result of recording such losses  intersegment profit commissions of million due to navigators agencies were reduced 
the company also recorded adverse development in of approximately million for specialty business mostly for california contractors liability business  and approximately million for other marine business and million for other run off business 
the company strengthened its reserves for the california contractors liability business as a result of an internal actuarial analysis of the specialty business conducted during the fourth quarter 
the pre tax yield on the insurance companies investment portfolio approximated  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in the yield was primarily due to the investment of new funds  including the million a n n u a l r e p o r t statutory surplus contribution from the net proceeds from our october equity offering  in an environment of gradually increasing interest rates as monetary policy tightened throughout the year 
average yields in the company s investments declined during and primarily as the result of market yields decreasing through the first half of and then gradually increasing as monetary policy began to tighten 
during this period  the strong cash flow and the million statutory surplus contribution from the net proceeds from the company s october stock offering were being invested 
due to the lag between receiving funds and investing long term  short term balances increased each year 
secondarily  the company s investment strategy began to lean towards tax exempt securities as the company was exiting an amt carry forward position 
generally  short term investments and tax exempt securities have lower pre tax yields than the remainder of the company s portfolio 
these factors along with the reinvestment of maturities  calls and redemptions at the then prevailing interest rates  which were generally lower than the yields of such investments maturing  called or redeemed  resulted in decreases to the overall portfolio yield  but in line with prevailing interest rates based on our portfolio mix 
net investment income increased in compared to despite declines in the average investment yield on the portfolio due to strong cash flows throughout and coupled with the receipt of million of statutory surplus contributions in the fourth quarter 
lloyd s operations the lloyd s operations consist of nual  a lloyd s of london underwriting agency which manages lloyd s syndicate  millennium underwriting ltd

the lloyd s marine business had been subject to deteriorating pricing beginning in the mid s 
the pricing competition showed some signs of stabilizing in and prices increased in  and the pricing stayed relatively stable and increased by approximately 
lloyd s presents its results on an underwriting year basis  generally closing each underwriting year after three years 
we make estimates for each underwriting year and timely accrue the expected results 
our lloyd s operations included in the consolidated financial statements represent our participation in syndicate in september  the company purchased the remaining outstanding minority interest and will own of syndicate s capacity for the underwriting year 
a n n u a l r e p o r t lloyd s syndicates report the amounts of premiums  claims  and expenses recorded in an underwriting account for a particular year to the companies or individuals that participate in the syndicates 
the syndicates generally keep accounts open for three years 
traditionally  three years have been necessary to report substantially all premiums associated with an underwriting year and to report most related claims  although claims may remain unsettled after the underwriting year is closed 
a lloyd s syndicate typically closes an underwriting year by reinsuring outstanding claims on that underwriting year with the participants for the next underwriting year 
the ceding participants pay the assuming participants an amount based on the unearned premiums and outstanding claims in the underwriting year at the date of the assumption 
our participation in lloyd s syndicate is represented by and recorded as our proportionate share of the underlying assets and liabilities and results of operations of the syndicate  since i we hold an undivided interest in each asset  ii we are proportionately liable for each liability and iii syndicate is not a separate legal entity 
at lloyd s  the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close the ritc 
the ritc amounts represent the transfer of the assets and liabilities from the participants of a closing underwriting year to the participants of the next underwriting year 
to the extent our participation in the syndicate changes  the ritc amounts vary accordingly 
the ritc transaction is recorded in the fourth quarter as additional written and earned premium  losses incurred  loss reserves and receivables  all in the same amount 
there were no gains or losses recorded on the ritc transaction 
we provide letters of credit to lloyd s to support our participation in syndicate s stamp capacity as discussed below under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
wherever a member of lloyd s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders  such debts may be payable by the lloyd s central fund 
if lloyd s determines that the central fund needs to be increased  it has the power to assess premium levies on current lloyd s members up to of a member s underwriting capacity in any one year 
the company does not believe that any assessment is likely in the foreseeable future and has not provided any allowance for such an assessment 
however  based on the company s capacity at lloyd s of million  the december  exchange rate of equals and in the event of a maximum assessment  the company would be assessed approximately million

liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the increases in the  and operating cash flows were primarily due to the increases in net written premium 
operating cash flow was used primarily to acquire additional investments 
investments and cash increased to  million at december  from million at december  and million at december  the increases were primarily due to the positive cash flow  million of net proceeds received from the equity offering in october and the million of net proceeds received from the equity offering in october net investment income was million for  million for and million for at december   the weighted average rating of our fixed maturity investments was aa by standard poor s and aa by moody s 
we believe that we have no significant exposure to credit risk since the fixed maturity investment portfolio consists of investment grade bonds 
at december   our portfolio had an average maturity of years and a duration of years 
management continually monitors the composition and cash flow of the investment portfolio in order to maintain the appropriate levels of liquidity to ensure our ability to satisfy claims 
no impairment losses were incurred in  or as of december  and  all fixed maturity securities and equity securities held by us were classified as available for sale 
we have a million credit facility with a consortium of banks consisting of million for letters of credit and a million credit line 
the credit facility  which is denominated in us dollars  is utilized primarily by navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
and millennium underwriting ltd 
to fund our participation in lloyd s syndicate which is denominated in british pounds 
at december   letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million were issued under the credit facility 
the credit line is unused at december  the credit facility is collateralized by all of the common stock of navigators insurance company 
the credit agreement contains covenants common to transactions of this type  including restrictions on indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers and the sale of assets  maintaining certain consolidated tangible net worth  statutory surplus and other financial ratios 
cash dividends to shareholders are limited to million per year 
no dividends have been declared or paid and we were in compliance with all covenants through december  the credit facility expires on june  if at that time the banks do not renew the credit facility  we will need to find other sources to provide the letters of credit or other collateral in order to continue our participation in syndicate a n n u a l r e p o r t at december   our consolidated stockholders equity was million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the million of net proceeds from the october equity offering and  to a lesser extent  the year net income of million offset by million of after tax unrealized loss for the year ended december  our reinsurance has been placed with various us and foreign insurance companies and with selected syndicates at lloyd s 
pursuant to the implementation of lloyd s plan of reconstruction and renewal  a portion of our recoverables are now reinsured by equitas a separate united kingdom authorized reinsurance company established to reinsure outstanding liabilities of all lloyd s members for all risks written in the or prior years of account 
time lags do occur in the normal course of business between the time gross losses are paid by the company and the time such gross losses are billed and collected from reinsurers 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively of gross incurred losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  were ceded to reinsurers under pro rata and quota share treaties 
such recoverable amounts are anticipated to be billed and collected over the next several years as gross losses are paid by the company 
generally  for pro rata or quota share reinsurers  including pool participants  the company issues quarterly settlement statements for premiums less commissions and paid loss activity  which are expected to be settled within days after the quarter end 
the company has the ability to issue cash calls requiring such reinsurers to pay losses whenever paid loss activity ceded to a particular reinsurance treaty exceeds a predetermined amount generally not more than million as set forth in the pro rata treaty 
for the insurance companies  cash calls must generally be paid within business days 
there is no specific settlement period for the lloyd s operations cash call provisions but such billings are generally paid within days 
generally  for excess of loss reinsurers the company pays monthly or quarterly deposit premiums based on the estimated subject premiums over the contract period usually one year which are subsequently adjusted based on actual premiums determined after the expiration of the applicable reinsurance treaty 
paid losses subject to excess of loss recoveries are generally billed as they occur and are usually settled by reinsurers within business days for the insurance companies and business days for the lloyd s operations 
the company sometimes withholds funds from reinsurers and may apply ceded loss billings against such funds in accordance with the applicable reinsurance agreements 
at december   approximately million was due from reinsurers under pro rata and excess of loss reinsurance treaties in connection with our asbestos exposures of which million is due from equitas 
approximately of such amounts will be due and payable to the company over the next two years as the gross asbestos losses are billed and paid by the company 
the company generally experiences significant collection delays for a large portion of such balances given that certain reinsurers are in run off or otherwise no longer active in the reinsurance business 
such circumstances are considered in the company s ongoing assessment of such reinsurance recoverables 
the company believes that it has adequately managed its cash flow requirements related to reinsurance recoveries from its positive cash flows and the use of available short term funds when applicable 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to continue to adequately manage such recoveries in the future or that collection disputes or reinsurer insolvencies will not arise that could materially increase the collection time lags or result in recoverable write offs causing additional incurred losses and liquidity constraints to the company 
the payment of gross claims and related collections from reinsurers with respect to hurricanes katrina and rita could significantly impact the company s liquidity needs 
however  we expect to pay the hurricane losses over a period of years from cash flow and  if needed  short term investments and expect to collect our paid reinsurance recoverables generally under the terms described above 
a n n u a l r e p o r t we primarily rely upon dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our holding company obligations 
the dividends have historically come primarily from navigators insurance company 
at december   the maximum amount available for the payment of dividends by navigators insurance company during without prior regulatory approval was  during  and  navigators insurance company paid dividends to us of million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
economic conditions we are a specialty insurance company and periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct effect on our underwriting operations 
they do  however  impact our investment portfolio 
a decrease in interest rates will tend to decrease our yield and have a positive effect on the fair value of our invested assets 
an increase in interest rates will tend to increase our yield and have a negative effect on the fair value of our invested assets 
we also consider the potential impact of economic trends in estimating loss reserves 
our management believes that the underwriting controls it maintains  and the fact that a significant amount of our business is in lines of insurance which have relatively short loss payout patterns  assist in estimating ultimate claim costs more reasonably and lessen the potential adverse impact of the economy on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures have been managed through december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december  was  million of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
our exposure to equity price risk and foreign exchange risk is not significant 
we have no commodity risk 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
there were no significant changes regarding the investment portfolio in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed between the year ended december  and the year ended december  we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
a n n u a l r e p o r t sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to our market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the sensitivity analysis model used by us produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss amount only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of our fixed maturities and short term investments  which constitute approximately of total assets as of december  the loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments  as a result of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   is not material
