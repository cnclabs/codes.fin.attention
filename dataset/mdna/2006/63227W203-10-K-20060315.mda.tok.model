item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we restructured our organization effective as of january  in order to improve our execution and customer focus 
our business segments are oil water technologies  gas technologies and automation controls 
the oil water technologies group is our largest segment and consists of two product lines 
the first is our standard and traditional product line consisting of oil and gas separation and dehydration equipment sales and related services and an extensive north american branch distribution network 
the second product line includes built to order process systems  which are focused primarily on oil and water production and processing systems designed and built to meet customer specifications 
the gas technologies group includes our co membrane business  the assets and operating relationship related to a gas processing facilities in west texas  hs removal technologies including shell paques  and other gas related technologies that focus on removing contaminants from the gas stream 
the automation controls group focuses on sales of new control panels and systems that monitor and control oil and gas production  as well as field service activities  including repair  maintenance  testing and inspection services for existing systems 
for financial reporting purposes  beginning in  we allocate corporate and other expenses to each of the segments  rather than segregating these costs on a standalone basis 
furthermore  certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal and fiscal amounts in order to present these results on a comparable basis with amounts for fiscal forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended each a forward looking statement

we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the results reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on our future expectations we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenues and related costs when products are shipped and services are rendered for time and materials and service contracts  manufactured goods produced in standard manufacturing operations and sold in the ordinary course of business through regular marketing channels and certain customized manufactured goods that are smaller jobs with less customization  making them similar to such standard manufactured goods that is  contracts valued at  or less having contract durations of four months or less 
we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method on contracts greater than  and having contract durations in excess of four months that represent customized  engineered orders of our products and qualify for such treatment in accordance with the requirements of aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of certain production type contracts sop 
in addition  we use the percentage of completion method on all automation controls segment equipment fabrication and sales projects that qualify for such treatment in accordance with the requirements of sop the automation controls segment sells customized products fabricated to order pursuant to a large number of smaller contracts with durations of two to three months  with occasional large systems projects of longer duration 
the segment does not produce standard units or maintain an inventory of products for sale 
due to the nature of the segment s equipment fabrication and sales operations  and the potential for wide variations in our results of operations that could occur from applying the as shipped methodology to smaller contracts for these customized  fabricated goods  this segment recognizes revenues  regardless of contract value or duration  applying the percentage of completion method 
in  approximately of total company revenues were recorded on an as shipped or as performed basis  and approximately were recorded using the percentage of completion method 
with respect to contract revenues recorded utilizing the percentage of completion method  earned revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date relate to total estimated costs of the project  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
total estimated contract cost is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect revenue and net income and it requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
total costs expected to be incurred  and therefore recognition of revenue  could be affected by various internal or external factors including  but not limited to changes in project scope change orders  changes in productivity  scheduling  the cost and availability of labor  the cost and availability of raw materials  the weather  client delays in providing approvals at benchmark stages of the project and the timing of deliveries from third party providers of key components 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known 
earned revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for agreed claims and change order revenues  if applicable 
losses expected to be incurred on the jobs in progress  after consideration of estimated probable minimum recoveries from claims and change orders  are charged to income as soon as such losses are known 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we generally recognize revenue and earnings to which the percentage of completion method applies over a period of two to six quarters 
in the event a project is terminated by our customer before completion  our customer is liable for costs incurred under the contract 
we believe our operating results should be evaluated over a term of one to three years to evaluate our performance under long term contracts  after all change orders  scope changes and cost recoveries have been negotiated and realized 
estimates are subjective in nature and it is possible that we could have used different estimates of total contract costs in our calculation of revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method 
as of december   the company had million in revenues attributable to open percentage completion projects having an aggregate gross margin of 
if we had used a different estimate of total contract costs for each contract in progress at december   a increase or decrease in the estimated margin earned on each contract would have increased or decreased total revenue and pre tax income for the year ended december   by approximately million 
at december   the company had three contracts in a loss position  with an estimated aggregate loss of  impairment testing goodwill 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of operating assets to the carrying value of those assets  including any related goodwill 
as required by sfas no 
 we identified separate reporting units for purposes of this evaluation 
we used our segments as the reporting units  and tested the segments as of year end in determining carrying value  we segregated assets and liabilities that  to the extent possible  are clearly identifiable by specific reporting unit 
certain corporate and other assets and liabilities  that are not clearly identifiable by specific reporting unit  are allocated as permitted by the standard 
fair value is determined by discounting projected future cash flows at our cost of capital rate  as calculated 
in determining projected future cash flows for each segment  we make assumptions regarding the following key indicators future market and sales growth rates domestic and international  cost inflation  margin expectations  working capital  capital expenditure levels and tax levels 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine whether or not impairment has occurred at the reporting unit level 
in the event an impairment is indicated  an additional test is performed whereby an implied fair value of goodwill is determined through an allocation of the fair value to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  whether recognized or unrecognized  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
any residual fair value after this purchase price allocation would be assumed to relate to goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the residual fair value  we would record an impairment charge for that amount 
net goodwill was million at december  we tested goodwill for impairment as required by sfas no 
at december   and we did not record an impairment charge as a result of this testing 
if the estimated fair values discounted cash flow for the three segments  oil water technologies  gas technologies and automation controls  were reduced by  and respectively  we would have been required to perform the second step of goodwill impairment as prescribed by sfas no 
deferred income tax assets valuation allowance 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires us to provide a valuation allowance for any deferred income tax assets we believe may not be utilized through future operations 
gross deferred tax assets  not requiring tax allowances  were million as of december  gross deferred tax assets  requiring a valuation allowance  were million as of december  we have a  valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain us tax attributes related to our uk subsidiary group  a valuation allowance of million related to our uk operations  and another  related to other foreign operations 
at year end  deferred tax assets  requiring a valuation allowance  were million which included a valuation allowance of million related to our uk operations 
the valuation allowance related to our uk operations was due to a severance and restructuring accrual of approximately million and continuing losses on contracts during the year  which resulted in cumulative pre tax losses for the prior three years 
during  the valuation allowance related to our uk operations was reduced to million predominately as a result of improved business that has allowed the utilization of loss carryforwards 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the balance of the deferred tax assets largely relates to us postretirement obligations  accrued liabilities and reserves that have not been deducted for tax purposes  and the carryforward of foreign tax credits 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projected future taxable income over the periods to which our deferred tax assets are deductible in the us and canadian tax jurisdictions  we believe it is more likely than not we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences and carryforwards  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  in the us and canadian tax jurisdictions 
however  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  and thus the amount of these valuation allowances  could change if future taxable income differs from our projections in the us and canadian tax jurisdictions 
in all other foreign tax jurisdictions we are currently not considering projections of future taxable income to determine the realizability of our deductible differences and carryforwards 
industry and business environment as one of the leading providers of wellhead process equipment  systems and services used in the production of oil and gas  our revenue and results of operations are closely tied to demand for oil and gas products and spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
these companies generally invest more in exploration and development efforts during periods of favorable oil and gas commodity prices  and invest less during periods of unfavorable oil and gas prices 
as supply and demand change  commodity prices fluctuate  producing cyclical trends in the industry 
during periods of lower demand  revenue for service providers such as natco generally decline  as existing projects are completed  new projects are postponed and pricing decreases due to competitive pressures 
during periods of recovery  revenue for process equipment providers can lag behind the industry due to the timing of new project awards 
changes in commodity prices have impacted our business over the past several years 
the following table summarizes the price of domestic crude oil per barrel and the wellhead price of natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf  as published by the us department of energy  and the number of rotary drilling rigs in operation  as published by baker hughes incorporated  for the most recent five years year ended december  average price of crude oil per barrel in the us average price of brent crude oil per barrel average wellhead price of natural gas per mcf in the us average us rig count average international rig count excludes north america historically  we have viewed operating rig counts as a benchmark of spending in the us oil and gas industry for exploration and development efforts 
our standard and traditional equipment sales  parts and services business generally correlates to changes in rig activity  but tends to lag behind the north american rig count trend 
from a longer term perspective  the us department of energy projects that us demand for and consumption of petroleum and natural gas products will increase through  with higher consumption rates expected worldwide  driven by demand for refined products and the use of natural gas to power plants that generate electricity 
as demand grows and reserves in the united states decline  producers and service providers in the oil and gas industry may continue to rely more heavily on global sources of energy and expansion into new markets 
the industry continues to seek more innovative and technologically efficient means to extract hydrocarbons from existing fields  as production profiles change 
as a result  additional and more complex equipment may be required to produce oil and gas from these fields 
also  many new oil and gas fields produce lower quality or contaminated hydrocarbon streams  requiring more complex production equipment 
in general  these trends should increase the demand for our products and services

index to financial statements results of operations revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  during  the continued strong rig activity in north america and escalating activity in built to order projects both domestically and internationally contributed to demand within our oil water technologies segment  resulting in record revenue and profits for this segment 
in our gas technologies segment  increased throughput at our west texas co processing facilities and higher levels of membrane replacement sales during contributed favorably to our results and offset a reduction in built to order projects due to the timing of awards and associated revenue 
results in our automation controls segment improved due to increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico  in spite of the impact of hurricanes kartrina and rita  and continued growth from our west africa operations 
all of our built to order business is impacted by the timing of awards related to large  complex oil and gas projects  primarily in international offshore locations 
these projects typically have a longer bidding  evaluation  and construction period than our standard and traditional equipment sales cycle business and are heavily influenced by the oil and gas supply and demand outlook  expected commodity prices as well as political or governmental risks

preferred shares on march   we issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred shares  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  to lime rock partners ii  lp  a private investment fund  for an aggregate price of million 
approximately  of the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the warrants 
proceeds from the issuance of these securities  net of related issuance costs of  were used to reduce our outstanding revolving debt balances and for other general corporate purposes 
each of the series b preferred shares has a face value of  and pays a cumulative dividend of per annum of face value  which is payable semi annually on june and december of each year  except the initial dividend payment which was payable on july  each of the series b preferred shares is convertible  at the option of the holder  into a number of shares of common stock equal to the face value of such series b preferred share divided by the conversion price  which was or an aggregate of  shares at december   and a cash payment equal to the amount of dividends on such share that have accrued since the prior semi annual dividend payment date

if the holder of the series b preferred shares converts upon a change in control occurring on or before march   the holder would also be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the dividends that would have accrued through march  less the sum of the aggregate amount of dividends paid in cash through the date of conversion  and the aggregate amount of dividends accrued in prior periods but not yet paid 
we have the right to call for redemption  the series b preferred shares for cash on or after march   at a redemption price per share equal to the face value of the series b preferred shares plus the amount of dividends that have been accrued but not paid since the most recent semi annual dividend payment date 
due to the cash redemption features upon a change in control as described above  the series b preferred shares do not qualify for permanent equity treatment in accordance with the emerging issues task force topic d classification and measurement of redeemable securities  which specifically requires that permanent equity treatment be precluded for any security with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer 
therefore  we have accounted for the series b preferred shares as temporary equity in the accompanying balance sheet  and have not assigned any value to our right to redeem the series b preferred shares on or after march  if the series b preferred shares are redeemed under contingent redemption features  any redemption amount greater than carrying value would be recorded as a reduction of income allocable to common shareholders when the event becomes probable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are conducted around the world in a number of different countries 
accordingly  our earnings and cash flow are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions relate to operations in canada and the uk 
in canada  most contracts are denominated in canadian dollars  and most of the costs incurred are in canadian dollars  which mitigates risks associated with currency fluctuations 
in the uk  many of our sales contracts and material purchases are denominated in a currency other than british pounds sterling  primarily us dollars and euros  whereas our engineering and overhead costs are principally denominated in british pounds sterling 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk by requiring settlement in our functional currencies  when possible 
we do not currently enter into forward contracts or other currency related derivative hedge arrangements 
our financial instruments are subject to changes in interest rates  including our revolving credit and term loan facilities  and our working capital facility for export sales

as of december   the weighted average interest rate of our borrowings under the revolving credit facilities was 
we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities or the working capital facility for export sales at december  based on past market movements and possible near term market movements  we do not believe that potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values or cash flows from changes in interest rates are likely to be material 
assuming our current level of borrowings  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates under our variable interest rate facilities would decrease net income and cash flow from operations by  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we could take action to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of actions that could be taken and the possible effects  this calculation assumes no such actions 
furthermore  this calculation does not consider the effects of a possible change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
