item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the st 
joe company is one of florida s largest real estate operating companies 
we believe we have one of the largest inventories of private land suitable for development in the state of florida  with a very low cost basis 
the majority of our land is located in northwest florida 
in order to optimize the value of these core real estate assets  our business plan calls for us to reposition our substantial timberland holdings for higher and better uses 
we increase the value of our raw land assets  most of which are currently managed as timberland  through the entitlement  development and subsequent sale of residential and commercial parcels  home sites and homes  or through the direct sale of unimproved land 
in addition  we reinvest the proceeds of qualifying asset sales into like kind properties under our tax deferral strategy  which has enabled us to create a significant portfolio of commercial rental properties 
we have four operating segments towns resorts  commercial real estate  land sales and forestry 
our towns resorts segment generates revenues from the sale of developed home sites to retail customers and builders  the sale of parcels of entitled  undeveloped land  the sale of housing units built by us  rental income  club operations  investments in limited partnerships and joint ventures  brokerage  title issuance and mortgage origination fees on certain transactions within our towns resorts developments  and management fees 
our commercial real estate segment generates revenues from the rental and or sale of commercial buildings owned and or developed by us  and the sale of developed and undeveloped land for retail  multi family  office and industrial uses 

table of contents our land sales segment generates revenues from the sale of parcels of undeveloped land  and the sale of developed home sites primarily within rural settings 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of pulpwood and timber  and the sale of cypress lumber and mulch 
our ability to obtain land use entitlements for our properties is a key requirement in repositioning our land to higher and better uses and for the generation of revenues 
we continue to plan and obtain entitlements for an increasingly diverse set of land uses including retail  office  industrial  multi family  marina and hotel uses 
at the end of  we had land use entitlements in hand or in process for approximately  residential units and million square feet of commercial space  with an additional acres zoned for commercial uses 
our ability to generate revenues  cash flows and profitability is directly related to the real estate market  primarily in florida  and the economy in general 
economic  political and weather related conditions could have adverse effects on consumer buying behavior  construction costs  availability of labor and materials  the cost and availability of insurance  the availability of and changes in prices of fuel and energy  and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general and coastal real estate in particular 
additionally  increases in interest rates could reduce the demand for homes we build and home sites we develop  particularly primary housing and home sites  and commercial properties we develop or sell 
sales activity in our resort residential projects in northwest florida slowed in the third and fourth quarters of as a result of an active hurricane season as well as macroeconomic and real estate supply and demand factors 
while sales activity in our primary residential communities remained robust through most of  there are some signs of slowing in the most recent months compared to strong sales for the same period last year  potentially as a result of these same macroeconomic and real estate supply and demand factors 
the hurricane season was particularly active  with four named storms impacting the coast of the gulf of mexico during these quarters 
we were fortunate that there was only minimal physical damage to our properties  allowing us to quickly resume normal operations after each storm 
however  the hurricanes in disrupted and depressed normal visitor traffic flows and consequently demand for resort residential properties 
resort sales have remained slow thus far in the first quarter of  traditionally the off season for northwest florida 
the possible residual effects of s hurricane season and subsequent increases in resale supply have added some uncertainty to the timing of the rebound of resort residential sales 
we do not expect a return to the fevered market of the past few years  but a return to something closer to the historical norm 
we continue to view these factors as temporary but meaningful influences on near term earnings 
also during  we noticed an increase in labor and construction material costs  which we attribute in part to the hurricane season 
although historically we have been able to offset increases in labor and construction material costs by increasing sales prices  as a result of the real estate supply and demand factors noted above  we may not be able to offset such costs with increased prices in the near future 
consequently  we believe our margins may be adversely affected by any additional increases in labor and construction material costs 
it will remain unclear for some time what direct and indirect impacts the hurricane season and these other factors will have on the company 
we remain disciplined in this slowing market 
we are continuing to diversify our customer base  to include individual homeowners and national homebuilders  local florida buyers and transitioning baby boomers  local commercial developers and regional and national developers 
additionally  we have increased our marketing efforts to promote sales growth 

table of contents forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including statements about our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  estimates and intentions  as well as trends and uncertainties that could affect our results 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for additional information concerning these factors and related matters  see risk factors in item a of the report and forward looking statements in item of this report 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that the project is economically probable 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest based on the amount of underlying expenditures up to total interest expense  and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period such determination is made 
real estate inventory costs include land and common development costs  such as roads  sewers and amenities  home construction costs  property taxes  capitalized interest and certain indirect costs 
a portion of real estate inventory and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 
the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and related real estate expenditures 
management s assumptions about future housing and home site sales prices  sales volume and sales velocity require significant judgment because the real estate market is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
in addition  actual results could differ from management s estimates due to changes in anticipated development  construction and overhead costs 
although we have not made significant adjustments affecting real estate gross profit margins in the past  there can be no assurances that estimates used to generate future real estate gross profit margins will not differ from our current estimates 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized using the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured  and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 

table of contents revenue for our multi family residences which were under construction at watersound beach in was recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
since the project was substantially completed as of december   we recorded substantially all of the activity related to this property during the year ended december  during the period ended march   we incurred million in construction cost adjustments for this project 
had these costs been quantified in  they would have been included in our budgets and thus have had an impact on our results for the year ended december  if these costs had been included in the total project budget  gross profit would have been reduced by million pre tax  million after tax  since a lower percentage of revenue would also have been recognized 
the results for the year ended december  would have been increased by million pre tax  million after tax 
management has evaluated the impact of this item  which represented of net income per diluted share for both years ended december  and  and concluded that it is not significant to our or results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
this review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used in determining whether impairment exists  including estimation of undiscounted cash flows 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i discounting expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of our markets and demand for real estate 
if we determine that impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
if such assets were held for sale  the provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value and is tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted  by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of each reporting unit with goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and estimates including estimating discounted future cash flows  net operating income  future economic conditions  fair value of assets held and discount rates 
if this comparison indicates that the goodwill of a particular reporting unit is impaired  the aggregate of the fair value of each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
intangible assets 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values  using customary estimates of fair value  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis and other methods 
these fair values can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors and estimates  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate  lease terms  amortization periods and fair market values assigned to leases as well as fair value assigned to customer relationships 
pension plan 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
currently  our pension plan is over funded and contributes income to the company 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the income contributed by the pension plan 
we engage the services of an independent actuary and investment consultant to assist us in determining these assumptions and in the calculation of pension income 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an 
table of contents equivalent decrease in pre tax income 
a increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in less than a million increase in pre tax income 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  we will include the adjustments in the tax provision in our financial statements 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions fas 
fas clarifies the accounting for sales and other transactions involving real estate time sharing transactions and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  upon adoption  we do not expect fas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
also in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets fas 
fas eliminates a previous exception from fair value reporting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and introduces an exception from fair value reporting for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary change is considered to have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
fas is applicable to nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
the impact of adopting fas did not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb published fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp  which stipulates that a lessee s rental costs associated with operating leases during a construction period must be recognized as rental expense  included in income from continuing operations and allocated over the lease term according to current guidance on accounting for leases 
we plan to adopt fsp beginning january   as required by the fsp 
upon adoption  we do not expect fsp to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force s eitf consensus on issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
in addition  the fasb has issued fsp sop  interaction of aicpa statement of position sop and eitf issue to amend sop  accounting for investments in real estate ventures  so that its guidance is consistent with the consensus reached by the eitf in eitf no 
eitf establishes that determining control of a limited partnership requires judgment  but that generally a sole general partner is deemed to control a limited partnership unless the limited partners have a the ability to substantially liquidate the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause and or b substantive participating rights 
the consensus is currently applicable to the company for new or modified partnerships  and will otherwise be applicable to existing partnerships in this consensus applies to limited partnerships or similar entities  such as limited liability companies that have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership 
we will not be required to consolidate any of our current unconsolidated investments nor will this eitf have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas 
fas requires companies making voluntary changes to their accounting policies to apply the changes retrospectively  meaning that past earnings will be revised to reflect the impact in each period  rather than the current practice of taking a single charge against current earnings 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting policies and to new rules issued by the fasb that require companies to change their accounting  unless otherwise stated in the new rules 
fas is effective for the company beginning january   with earlier application allowed 
we plan to adopt fas as of january   and do not expect fas to have a material effect on our current financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
the interpretation requires recognition of an asset and liability with regards to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset  such as the abatement of asbestos 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
did not have any effect on our financial statements 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a final rule regarding the compliance date for fasb no 
r  share based payment fas r  for public companies 
the new rule changes the required date of implementation to the beginning of the first full fiscal year beginning after june  as a result  we plan to adopt fas r as of january  fas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions  eliminating the alternative previously allowed to use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of the instruments using methods similar to those required previously and currently used by us to calculate pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures 
the cost will be recognized ratably over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
upon implementation of fas r  we will recognize compensation cost over the vesting period in our financial statements for the unvested portion of existing options granted prior to the compliance date and the cost of stock options granted to employees after the compliance date based on the fair value of the stock options at grant date 
we will continue to expense restricted stock compensation over the stock s vesting period  which is deemed to be the period for which services are performed 
additionally  the discount at which employees may purchase the company s common stock through payroll deductions will be recognized as compensation expense

segment results towns resorts our towns resorts segment develops large scale  mixed use resort  primary and secondary residential communities primarily on land with very low cost basis 
we own large tracts of land in northwest florida  including significant gulf of mexico beach frontage and waterfront properties  and land near jacksonville  in deland and near tallahassee  the state capital 
our residential homebuilding in north and south carolina is conducted through saussy burbank  inc saussy burbank  a wholly owned subsidiary 
sales activity in our resort residential projects in northwest florida slowed in the third and fourth quarters of as a result of an active hurricane season as well as macroeconomic and real estate supply and demand factors 
while sales activity in our primary residential communities remained robust through most of  there are some signs of slowing in the most recent months compared to strong sales for the same period last year  potentially as a result of these same macroeconomic and real estate supply and demand factors 
the hurricane season was particularly active  with four named storms impacting the coast of the gulf of mexico during these quarters 
we were fortunate that there was only minimal physical damage to our properties  allowing us to quickly resume normal operations after each storm 
however  the hurricanes in disrupted and depressed normal visitor traffic flows and consequently demand for resort residential properties 
resort sales have remained slow thus far in the first quarter of  traditionally the off season for northwest florida 
the possible residual effects of s hurricane season and subsequent increases in resale supply have added some uncertainty to the timing of the rebound of resort residential sales 
we do not expect a return to the fevered market of the past few years  but a return to something closer to the historical norm 
we continue to view these factors as temporary but meaningful influences on near term earnings 
also during  we noticed an increase in labor and construction material costs  which we attribute in part to the hurricane season 
although historically we have been able to offset increases in labor 
table of contents and construction material costs by increasing sales prices  as a result of the real estate supply and demand factors noted above  we may not be able to offset such costs with increased prices in the near future 
consequently  we believe our margins may be adversely affected by any additional increases in labor and construction material costs 
it will remain unclear for some time what direct and indirect impacts the hurricane season and the potential impact of these other factors will have on the company 
revenues and costs of sales associated with multi family units and private residence club prc units under construction are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
if a deposit is received for less than for a multi family unit or a prc unit  percentage of completion accounting is not utilized 
instead  full accrual accounting criteria are used  which recognize revenue when sales contracts are closed 
all deposits are non refundable subject to a day waiting period as required by law  except for non delivery of the unit 
in the event a contract does not close for reasons other than non delivery  we are entitled to retain the deposit 
however  the revenue and margin related to the previously recorded contract is reversed 
revenues and cost of sales associated with multi family units where construction has been completed before contracts are signed and deposits made are recognized on the full accrual method of accounting as contracts are closed 
our townhomes are attached building units sold individually along with a parcel of land 
revenues and cost of sales for our townhomes are accounted for using the full accrual method 
these units differ from multi family and prc units  in which buyers hold title to a unit or fractional share of a unit  respectively  within a building and an interest in the underlying land held in common with other building association members 
percentage of completion accounting is also used for home site sales when required development is not complete at the time of the sale 
currently  we are using percentage of completion accounting for home site sales at watersound west beach and summercamp 
cash is collected at the time of the sale  while gross profit on home site sales at those communities is recognized based on construction completed in relation to total development costs

the increase in revenues under the fiber agreement was primarily due to increasing prices under the terms of the agreement

revenues from the cypress mill operation were million in  million in and million in revenues from the cypress mill were lower in due to lower prices as a result of the increased supply of fallen timber caused by hurricanes 
in  revenues from the cypress mill decreased as we intentionally reduced production to help improve margins and profitability in response to challenges in finding wood supplies at acceptable prices 

table of contents cost of timber sales decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was in  in and in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to increased logging costs caused by fuel shortages from hurricane katrina  road maintenance and timber inventory costs 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was due to increased efficiencies in our cypress mill operation and slightly lower cost of sales for timber in compared to cost of sales for the cypress mill operation were million  or of revenues  in  million  or of revenues  in  and million  or of revenues  in cost of sales for timber was million  or of revenues in  million  or of revenues  in  and million  or of revenues  in liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations  sales of land holdings  other assets and subsidiaries  borrowings from financial institutions and other debt  and issuances of equity  primarily from the exercise of employee stock options 
we use cash for operations  real estate development  construction and homebuilding  repurchases of our common stock  payments of dividends  repayments of debt  payments of taxes  and investments in joint ventures and acquisitions 
management believes that our financial condition is strong and that our cash  real estate and other assets  operating cash flows  and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses  including the continued investment in real estate developments 
if our liquidity were not adequate to fund operating requirements  capital development  stock repurchases and dividends  we have various alternatives to change our cash flow  including reducing or eliminating our stock repurchase program  reducing or eliminating dividends  altering the timing of our development projects and or selling existing assets 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows related to assets ultimately planned to be sold  including towns resorts developments and related amenities  sales of undeveloped and developed land by our land sales and commercial segments  and our timberland operations are included in operating activities 
distributions of income from unconsolidated affiliates are included in cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
during such periods  expenditures relating to our towns resorts segment were million  million  and million  respectively 
expenditures for operating properties in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively  and were made up of commercial land development and residential club and resort property development 

table of contents the expenditures for operating activities relating to our towns resorts and commercial real estate segments are primarily for site infrastructure development  general amenity construction and construction of homes and commercial space 
approximately of these expenditures are for home construction that generally takes place after the signing of a binding contract with a buyer to purchase the home following construction 
as a consequence  if contract activity slows  home construction will also slow 
we expect this general expenditure level and relationship between expenditures and housing contracts to continue in the future 
over the next several years  our need for cash for operations will increase as development activity increases 
during  we will have four new residential communities under development which will require significant up front capital investment 
in addition to cash needed for increased development costs  we will most likely be required to make significant cash payments of income taxes for and future years 
cash flows from investing activities our assets purchased with tax deferred proceeds are intended to be held for investment purposes and related cash flows from acquisitions and dispositions of those assets are included in investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities also include commercial rental property and assets not held for sale 
distributions of capital from unconsolidated affiliates are included in cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in was million and included million in proceeds from sales of discontinued operations  net of cash included in assets sold

net cash used in investing activities in was million and included million for the purchase of four commercial buildings and related intangible assets and million for the development of commercial buildings and purchases of other real estate investments 
the purchase of commercial buildings and land  comprising the majority of the cash used in investing activities  generally follow the sale of real estate  principally land sales on a tax deferred basis 
the tax deferral requires the reinvestment of proceeds from qualifying sales within a required time frame 
we make these investments in buildings and land only when we can acquire these assets at attractive prices 
it is becoming increasingly difficult to acquire assets that meet our pricing and other criteria for reinvestment  and as a result we may not purchase commercial buildings and vacant land to the extent we have in the past 
additionally  if our sales activity slows  the related purchase activity may also slow 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in as a result of the significant new development and investing activities anticipated over the next several years  we expect debt to increase compared to december   levels 
we have approximately million of debt maturing in for  we expect to spend million to million for the repurchase of shares and dividend payments 
prior to july   we had a senior revolving credit facility the senior credit facility which was to mature on march   that was available for general corporate purposes 
on july   we entered into a new four year million senior revolving credit facility the new credit facility and repaid the balance of our senior credit facility 
the new credit facility  which expires on july   bears interest based on leverage levels at libor plus an applicable margin in the range of to 
table of contents the new credit facility contains financial covenants including maximum debt ratios and minimum fixed charge coverage and net worth requirements 
there was no outstanding balance on the new credit facility at december   and no outstanding balance on the senior credit facility at december  management believes that we were in compliance with the covenants of the new credit facility at december  at december   we had senior notes outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of million

the proceeds will be used to finance development and construction projects  to reduce revolving debt and for general corporate purposes 
interest is payable semiannually 
these notes contain financial covenants similar to those in the new credit facility 
during  we assumed an existing mortgage of million on a commercial building we purchased 
we have used community development district cdd bonds to finance the construction of infrastructure improvements at four of our projects 
the principal and interest payments on the bonds are paid by assessments on  or from sales proceeds of  the properties benefited by the improvements financed by the bonds 
we record a liability for future assessments which are fixed or determinable and will be levied against our properties 
in  we paid million in principal to one of the community development districts to pay off a portion of the cdd bonds 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  accounting for special assessments and tax increment financing  we have recorded as debt million  million and million related to cdd bonds as of december   and  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk related to our long term debt 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding under our million new credit facility  which matures on july  this debt accrues interest at different rates based on timing of the loan and our preferences  but generally will be either the one  two  three or six month london interbank offered rate libor plus a libor margin in effect at the time of the loan 
this loan potentially subjects us to interest rate risk relating to the change in the libor rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
if libor had been basis points higher or lower  the effect on net income with respect to interest expense on the million credit facility would have been a respective decrease or increase in the amount of million pre tax million net of tax
