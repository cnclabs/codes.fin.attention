item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation related party transactions 
we do not have any long term contracts with spt  pct or silicon professional alliance corporation  or spac  a subsidiary of pct 
spt  pct or spac may cease providing services to us at any time 
if spt  pct or spac were to terminate their relationship with us we would experience a delay in reestablishing warehousing  logistics and distribution functions  and it could impair our ability to collect accounts receivable from spt and may harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of foreign foundries to manufacture our products  and these foundries may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we outsource substantially all of our manufacturing and testing activities 
we currently buy all of our wafers and sorted die from a limited number of suppliers 
the majority of our products are manufactured by five foundries  tsmc in taiwan  seiko epson and yasu in japan and grace and shanghai hua hong nec electronic company limited  or hhnec  in china 
we have invested million in gsmc  a cayman islands company  which owns a wafer foundry subsidiary  grace  in shanghai  china 
we anticipate that these foundries  together with sanyo in japan  samsung in korea and vanguard and powerchip semiconductor corporation  or psc  in taiwan will manufacture substantially all of our products in if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of revenues or higher than anticipated costs of revenues  any of which could harm our operating results 
our revenues may be impacted by our ability to obtain adequate wafer supplies from our foundries 
the foundries with which we currently have arrangements  together with any additional foundry at which capacity might be obtained  may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices 
in addition  we have encountered delays in qualifying new products and in ramping up new product production and we could experience these delays in the future 
we are also subject to the risks of service disruptions  raw material shortages and price increases by our foundries 
such disruptions  shortages and price increases could harm our operating results 
manufacturing capacity has in the past been difficult to secure and if capacity constraints arise in the future our revenues may decline 
in order to grow  we need to increase our present manufacturing capacity 
we currently believe that the existing capacity plus additional future capacity from grace  hhnec and vanguard available to us will be sufficient through however  events that we have not foreseen could arise which would limit our capacity 
similar to our million investment in gsmc  we may determine that it is necessary to invest substantial capital in order to secure appropriate production capacity commitments 
if we cannot secure additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired and our operating results will be harmed 
our cost of revenues may increase if we are required to purchase manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing if we need substantial capital in order to secure this capacity and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers have  from time to time  experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from marginal design or manufacturing process drift 
yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process  which often makes them difficult  time consuming and costly to correct 
furthermore  we rely on independent foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability  which could harm our operating results 
if our foundries discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays and lower revenues 
our wafer and product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production on an older or lower volume manufacturing process that it uses to produce our parts 
additionally  we cannot be certain our foundries will continue to devote resources to advance the process technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
either one of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher costs of materials 
we depend on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
these risks may lead to increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
because our flash memory products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
due to the flash memory product cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could harm sales of our products 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor memory components and have recently added significant capacity for such production 
as noted under the section entitled competition see above  our low density memory products  medium density memory products  and high density memory products if we are successful in developing these products face substantial competition 
in addition  we may in the future experience direct competition from our foundry partners 
we have licensed to our foundry partners the right to fabricate products based on our technology and circuit design  and to sell such products worldwide  subject to our receipt of royalty payments 
competition may also come from alternative technologies such as ferroelectric random access memory devices  or fram  or other developing technologies 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products and ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we believe that products for these applications will encounter intense competition and be highly price sensitive 
while we are currently developing and introducing new products for these applications  we cannot assure you that these products will reach the market on time  will satisfactorily address customer needs  will be sold in high volume  or will be sold at profitable margins 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional personnel 
we are highly dependent on bing yeh  our president and chief executive officer  as well as the other principal members of our management team and engineering staff 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular the highly skilled design  applications and test engineers involved in the development of flash memory technology 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our corporate headquarters is located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secrets  copyrights  mask work rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
we hold patents in the united states relating to certain aspects of our products and processes  with expiration dates ranging from to and have filed for several more 
in addition  we hold several patents in europe  japan  korea  taiwan  and china 
we cannot assure you that any pending patent application will be granted 
our operating results could be harmed by the failure to protect our intellectual property 
we are engaged in securities class action suits and derivative suits  which may become time consuming  costly and divert management resources and could impact our stock price 
securities class action law suits are often brought against companies  particularly technology companies  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs and management resources in defending against such claims

public announcements may hurt our stock price 
during the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
our litigation may be expensive  may be protracted and confidential information may be compromised 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters  and at any time  additional claims may be filed against us  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigation 
further  because of the amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
for more information with respect to our litigation  please also see part i  item legal proceedings 
if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties may assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages that could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
in the past  we were sued by atmel corporation and intel corporation  among others  regarding patent infringement 
significant management time and financial resources were devoted to defending these lawsuits 
we settled with intel in may and with atmel in june in addition to the atmel and intel actions  we receive from time to time  letters or communications from other companies stating that such companies have patent rights that involve our products 
since the design of all of our products is based on superflash technology  any legal finding that the use of our superflash technology infringes the patent of another company would have a significantly negative effect on our entire product line and operating results 
furthermore  if such a finding were made  there can be no assurance that we could license the other company s technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we could successfully operate without such technology 
moreover  if we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages to the owner of the protected technology and could be prohibited from making  using  selling  or importing into the united states any products that infringe the protected technology 
in addition  the management attention consumed by and legal cost associated with any litigation could harm our operating results 
during the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
if an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility or those of our suppliers  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenues 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster such as typhoon near one or more of our major suppliers  like the earthquakes in september and march or the typhoons in september and july that occurred in taiwan  could potentially disrupt the operations of those suppliers  which could then limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
a virus or viral outbreak in asia could harm our business 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from asia and our logistics center is located in taiwan 
a virus or viral outbreak in asia  such as the sars outbreak in early or the current threat of the avian flu  could harm the operations of our suppliers  distributors  logistics center and those of our end customers  which could harm our business 
prolonged electrical power outages  energy shortages  or increased costs of energy could harm our business 
our design and process research and development facilities and our corporate offices are located in california  which is susceptible to power outages and shortages as well as increased energy costs 
to limit this exposure  all corporate computer systems at our main california facilities are on battery back up 
in addition  all of our engineering and back up servers and selected corporate servers are on generator back up 
while the majority of our production facilities are not located in california  more extensive power shortages in the state could delay our design and process research and development as well as increase our operating costs 
our growth has in the past placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market or sell our products or develop new products may be harmed 
our business has in the past experienced rapid growth which strained our internal systems and future growth will require us to continuously develop sophisticated information management systems in order to manage our business effectively 
we have implemented a supply chain management system and a vendor electronic data interface system 
there is no guarantee that these measures  in themselves  will be adequate to address any growth  or that we will be able to foresee in a timely manner other infrastructure needs before they arise 
our success depends on the ability of our executive officers to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations will be harmed 
if we fail to successfully implement new management information systems  our business may suffer severe inefficiencies that may harm the results of our operations 
future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  has issued changes to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states that  when implemented in the first quarter of  will require us to record charges to earnings for the stock options we grant and purchases of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules are creating uncertainty for public companies 
we continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we have invested resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment has resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and we may be harmed 
we  and our independent registered public accounting firm  determined that we had a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting in in the future  such events could cause our current and potential stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended december  and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements and the receipt of a positive attestation  or any attestation at all  by our independent regional accounting firm 
additionally  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors 
as of december   we did not maintain effective control over accounting for and review of the valuation of inventory  the income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts and licensing revenue because we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements 
because of this material weakness  our management concluded that  as of december   we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on those criteria 
as a result  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  issued an adverse opinion with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting and their report is included in our form k for the year ended december  as of december   these material weaknesses had been remediated 
for further information  see item a controls and procedures on page should we  or our independent registered public accounting firm  determine in future fiscal periods that we have additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted  and our results of operations or financial condition may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties  dilution and other harmful consequences 
over the past two years we have acquired emosyn  g plus and actrans 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets  including interests in our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions 
any of such transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  and in some cases  the need to transition operations onto our platforms and in some cases  the need to transition operations onto our technology platforms 
international acquisitions involve additional risks  including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risks  and the particular economic  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions 
as a result of future acquisitions or mergers  we might need to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 
risks related to our industry our success is dependent on the growth and strength of the flash memory market 
substantially all of our products  as well as all new products currently under design  are stand alone flash memory devices or devices embedded with flash memory 
a memory technology other than superflash may be adopted as an industry standard 
our competitors are generally in a better financial and marketing position than we are from which to influence industry acceptance of a particular memory technology 
in particular  a primary source of competition may come from alternative technologies such as fram devices if such technology is commercialized for higher density applications 
to the extent our competitors are able to promote a technology other than superflash as an industry standard  our business will be seriously harmed 
the selling prices for our products are extremely volatile and have historically declined during periods of over capacity or industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by periodic changes in business conditions caused by product supply and demand imbalance 
when the industry experiences downturns  they often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated declines of average selling prices 
in some cases  downturns  such as the one we experienced from late through  have lasted for more than a year 
our business could be further harmed by industry wide prolonged downturns in the future 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated decline of selling prices 
we experienced a decrease in the average selling prices of our products as a result of the industry wide oversupply and excessive inventory in the market in the second half of and the first half of although we have seen strengthening of market demand in the second half of  our business could be further harmed by industry wide prolonged downturns in the future 
there is seasonality in our business and if we fail to continue to introduce new products this seasonality may become more pronounced 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics applications market are subject to seasonality 
as a result  sales of these products are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of each year 
in the past we have been able to mitigate such seasonality with the introduction of new products throughout the year 
if we fail to continue to introduce new products  our business may suffer and the seasonality of a portion of our sales may become more pronounced

overview we are a leading supplier of flash memory semiconductor devices addressing the needs of high volume applications 
we believe our proprietary flash memory technology  superflash  offers superior performance to other flash memory solutions 
in addition  we believe superflash has benefits that include high reliability  fast  fixed erase time  the ability to be scaled to a smaller size and a low cost manufacturing process 
our products are produced to meet the needs of a wide range of digital consumer  networking  wireless communications and internet computing markets 
our product offerings include standard flash products  application specific memory products  embedded controllers and mass data storage products 
our memory devices have densities ranging from kbit to mbit and are generally used for the storage of program code 
our flash embedded microcontrollers support concurrent flash read while write operations using in application programming  or iap 
our mass data storage products are used for storing images  music and other data in devices such as digital cameras and mp players 
one of our key initiatives is the active development of our non memory business 
our objective is to transform sst from a pure play in flash to a multi product line company 
we continue to execute on our plan to achieve  by mid  revenue contribution from non memory products  which includes embedded controllers  nand controller based products  smart card ics and radio frequency ics and modules 
during  we achieved product revenue contribution from non memory products 
we believe that non memory products represent an area in which we have significant competitive advantages and can yield profitable revenue with higher and more stable gross margins than our memory products in the long run 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by periodic changes in business conditions caused by product supply and demand imbalance 
when the industry experiences downturns  they often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated decline of selling prices 
we experienced a decrease in the average selling prices of our products as a result of the industry wide oversupply and excessive inventory in the market in the second half of and the first half of although we have seen strengthening of market demand in the second half of  our business could be further harmed by industry wide prolonged downturns in the future 
our product sales are made primarily using short term cancelable purchase orders 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as shipment schedules  are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs and in our supply of products 
accordingly  our backlog of open purchase orders at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales

during the we experienced market softness during the first two quarters of the year with upwards trends in the second half 
units shipped in the second half of grew more than over the first half and during the fourth quarter of  unit shipments set a new record of more than million units per calendar day  including an increase from our previous record achieved in the third quarter of we also experienced shipment records in many high volume applications  including dvd recorders  dvd rewritable drives  mp players  digital tvs  desktop and notebook pcs  hard disk drives  printers and lcd monitors 
we are continuing to drive manufacturing cost reductions through the transition to smaller geometries 
substantially all new wafer starts are now in micron and micron geometries and we are in the process of intensively developing micron and micron process technologies for high density serial flash and a low cost megabit product that are targeted for production in the second half of while our near term cost structure for megabits and above densities is mainly determined by our micron inventory  we believe that with our cost reduction efforts using more advanced micron technology  we will begin to realize benefits during the later part of gross profit was million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in gross profit in when compared to is primarily due to improved manufacturing costs achieved by transitioning manufacturing technology to smaller geometries  the sale of previously reserved inventory  increases in average selling prices and unit shipments by and  respectively  as well as increased revenues from technology licensing  offset by a net increase of million in our provision for inventory and adverse purchase commitments over the provision

research and development percent of revenue research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  quality assurance activities and occupancy costs 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits and the cost of materials such as wafers and masks 
research and development expenses increased from to mainly due to a million increase in salaries and wages related to an increase in headcount from the acquisitions  partially offset by a million decrease in profit sharing 
research and development expenses increased by from to primarily due to increases in wafer  mask and evaluation part expenses of million due to the completion of certain technology projects during  and increased headcount related expenses of million due to profit sharing payments and increased headcount

impairment of equity investments during and we recorded impairment charges on our equity investments of million and thousand  respectively 
there were no impairments during during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down one of our investments  advanced chip engineering technology  or acet  since acet issued a secondary round of equity funding at a lower per share price than our carrying value 
consequently  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our existing investment 
as of december   the recorded value of our investment in acet was million 
during  one of our investments  insyde  saw a significant decline in the market value of their stock 
we recognized a thousand loss from the impairment of our investment in insyde because its stock price had declined below the acquisition cost for more than six months 
the impairment was considered to be other than temporary in nature  thus the investment value was permanently written down to reflect the fair value 
provision for benefit from income taxes we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred by us in the us in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
our tax provision for was million on a pre tax loss of million consisting primarily of foreign withholding taxes and foreign income taxes 
in  our income tax expense was million on net income before tax of million 
during  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
in  we implemented an international tax structure  which in conjunction with the full valuation allowance  will mean that going forward we will record a tax expense as a result of foreign tax withholding and alternative minimum tax until such time that the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is no longer required

critical accounting estimates our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market  warranty accrual  litigation costs  valuation of equity investments  provision for adverse purchase commitments  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
sales to direct customers and foreign stocking representatives are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns 
when product is shipped to direct customers or stocking representatives  or by our distributors or spt to end users  prior to recognizing revenue  we also require that evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
legal title generally passes to our customers at the time our products are shipped 
payment terms typically range from to days 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  we defer recognition of such revenues  related costs of revenues and related gross profit until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as our inventory held at our logistics center  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
most of our technology licenses provide for the payment of up front license fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
for license and other arrangements for technology that we are continuing to enhance and refine  and under which we are obligated to provide unspecified enhancements  revenue is recognized over the lesser of the estimated period that we have historically enhanced and developed refinements to the technology  approximately two to three years the upgrade period  or the remaining portion of the upgrade period from the date of delivery  provided all specified technology and documentation has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
from time to time  we reexamine the estimated upgrade period relating to licensed technology to determine if a change in the estimated upgrade period is needed 
revenue from license or other technology arrangements where we are not continuing to enhance and refine technology or are not obligated to provide unspecified enhancements is recognized upon delivery  if the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
royalties received under these arrangements during the upgrade period are recognized as revenue based on the ratio of the elapsed portion of the upgrade period to the estimated upgrade period 
the remaining portions of the royalties are recognized ratably over the remaining portion of the upgrade period 
royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed are recognized when reported to us 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates in relation to the estimated period of technology enhancement and development  the amount and timing of our license and royalty revenues could be materially different 
allowance for sales returns 
we maintain allowances for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other estimates 
the allowance for sales returns was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other estimates 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and thousand as of december   and  respectively 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future average selling prices  and  if our projected average selling prices are over estimated  we may be required to reduce our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we maintain allowance for inventory for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and those inventories carried at costs that are higher than their market values 
we review on hand inventory including inventory held at the logistic center for potential excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market exposure and adjust the level of inventory reserve accordingly 
some of our customers have requested that we ship them product that has a finished goods date of manufacture that is less than one year old 
in the event that this becomes a common requirement  it may be necessary for us to provide for an additional allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old  which could result in additional inventory write downs 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories includes an allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than two years old and for certain products with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old 
for the obsolete inventory analysis  we review inventory items in detail and consider date code  customer base requirements  known product defects  planned or recent product revisions  end of life plans and diminished market demand 
if we determine that market conditions are less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
warranty accrual 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we will replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the recorded value of our warranty accrual was thousand  million and thousand as of december   and  respectively 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are also involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters 
there can be no assurance that shareholder class action complaints  shareholder derivative complaints or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
as of december   no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies 
if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations in the semiconductor industry 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
provision for adverse purchase commitments 
we maintain a provision for adverse purchase commitments for in process orders at our vendors when there is a lower of cost or market valuation against our on hand inventory 
once production has begun against our purchase orders  we are committed to purchasing the inventory or  if we cancel the order  we are liable for all costs incurred up to the time of cancellation 
if we have written down our on hand inventory of the ordered product for lower of cost or market valuations  we must consider the impact to in process inventory at our vendor 
we evaluate our in process orders to determine the impact of canceling the order and the impact of purchasing the inventory at a cost higher than the estimated current market value 
if we determine that market conditions become less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required when the inventory is purchased 
the recorded provision for adverse purchase commitments was thousand  million and million as of december   and  respectively

operating capital requirements 
we believe that our cash balances  together with funds we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional borrowings or capital and  if so required  that such borrowing or capital will be available on acceptable terms 
factors that could affect our short term and long term cash used or generated from operations and as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include the average selling prices of our products  customer demand for our products  the need to secure future wafer production capacity from our suppliers  the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue  merger  acquisition or joint venture projects  investments in strategic business partners  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and the outcome of ongoing litigation

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised  or sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb and supersedes apb no 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for good or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments must be estimated using option pricing models adjusted fo r the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
in addition  sfas r requires that a public entity measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value and that the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
sfas r allows for either modified prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition 
we plan to apply the modified prospective recognition method 
in april  the sec adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates of sfas r 
the effective date of sfas r for us is the first interim period of we have determined the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated operating expenses 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab sab includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas r 
we expect to apply the principles of sab in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas sfas replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  or eitf eitf discusses whether inventory purchase and sales transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined and treated as a nonmonetary exchange and addresses a under what circumstances should two or more transactions with the same counterparty counterparties be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction within the scope of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  or apb  and financial accounting standard no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb  or sfas  and b if nonmonetary transactions within the scope of apb and fas involve inventory  are there any circumstances under which the transactions should be recognized at fair value 
the pronouncement is effective for new inventory arrangements entered into  or modifications or renewals of existing inventory arrangements occurring in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after march  we do not expect that this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
currently  we do not hedge these foreign exchange rate exposures 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce revenues and or result in operating losses 
in addition  a downturn in the economies of china  japan or taiwan could impair the value of our equity investments in companies with operations in these countries 
if we consider the value of these companies to be impaired  we will write off  or expense  some or all of our investments 
in  we wrote down our investment in kye by million to million due to an other than temporary decline in its market value 
as of december   the market value of our kye investment was million based on the quoted market price 
in the third quarter of  we wrote down our investment in apacer  a privately held memory module manufacturer located in taiwan  by million due to a other than temporary decline in its value 
as of december   the recorded value of our apacer investment was million 
during  we wrote down our investment in insyde by thousand because insyde s stock price had declined below our cost basis on a other than temporary basis 
during  we wrote down our investment in acet by million since acet issued a secondary round of equity funding at a lower per share price than our carrying value 
as of december   the recorded value of our investment in acet was million 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of december  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
as of december   the carrying value of our available for sale investments approximated fair value 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our unrestricted and restricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments as of december  in thousands carrying interest value rate short term available for sale investments fixed rate cash and cash equivalents variable rate
