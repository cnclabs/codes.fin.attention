item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements reflect  under the heading discontinued operations  our estimate of the net losses we expected from these operations through the date we estimated they would be disposed  and all losses expected to be realized upon the disposal of these operations 
even after the disposition of these businesses  we may continue to be exposed to some liabilities arising from their prior operations 
additionally  when we sell one of our subsidiaries  the operative contractual agreement may contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities that arose prior to the sale date but that are discovered afterwards 
even though these liabilities are often capped  until the indemnification period expires  we may continue to be exposed to such liabilities 

table of contents if we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations  we could be liable for various penalties or sanctions 
we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government contracts 
in complying with these laws and regulations  we may incur additional costs  and non compliance may also allow for the assignment of additional fines and penalties  including contractual damages 
among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are the following the federal acquisition regulations along with agency regulations supplemental to the federal acquisition regulations  comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts the truth in negotiations act requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations the cost accounting standards and cost principles imposes accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based federal government contracts laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data 
we engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of us export control laws 
failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties  both civil and criminal  and can include debarment from contracting with the us government 
our contracting agency customers periodically review our performance under and compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts 
we also routinely perform internal reviews 
as a result of these reviews  we may learn that we are not in compliance with all of the terms of our contracts 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits cost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses suspension of payments fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may also suffer harm to our reputation  which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts 
if we are subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation  our current business  future prospects  financial condition  or operating results could be materially harmed 
in addition  we are subject to industrial security regulations of the department of defense and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against unauthorized release or access to classified information by foreign nationals 
the government may also reform our procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  including cost accounting standards  that could be costly to satisfy or that could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
unfavorable federal government audit results could subject us to penalties or sanctions  and could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers and impair our ability to win new contracts 
the defense contract audit agency dcaa and other government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contracts 
these agencies review a contractor s performance on its contract  cost structure and 
table of contents compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
the dcaa also reviews the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
therefore  a dcaa audit could materially affect our competitive position and result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
we derive significant revenues from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process 
we expect that a significant portion of our future business will be awarded through competitive bidding 
competitive bidding presents a number of risks  including bidding on programs in advance of the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns  spending substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us  which may result in reduced profitability  failing to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we are awarded  incurring expense and delay due to a competitor s protest or challenge of contract awards made to us  including the risk that any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications  or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract  which may result in reduced profitability  changes to client bidding practices or government reform of its procurement practices  which may alter the prescribed contract relating to gsa contracts or other government wide contracts  and changes in policy and goals by the government providing set aside funds to small businesses  disadvantaged businesses  and other socio economic requirements in the allocation of contracts 
we may not be provided the opportunity in the near term to bid on contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the government extends the existing contract 
if we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process  we may be unable to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for a number of years 
if we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period  our business and prospects will be adversely affected 
the government may terminate our federal government contracts at any time 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that may span one or more base years and one or more option years 
the option periods typically cover more than one half of the contract s duration 
federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods 
additionally  federal government contracts typically contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contracts for its convenience 
a decision not to exercise option periods or a decision to terminate contracts could result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues and reduce the profitability of these contracts to us 

table of contents we may not accurately estimate the expenses  time and resources necessary to satisfy our contractual obligations 
we enter into three types of federal government contracts for our services cost plus  time and materials and fixed price 
for our last two fiscal years  we derived revenue from such contracts as follows contract type cost plus time and materials fixed price under cost plus contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
to the extent that the actual costs incurred in performing a cost plus contract are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract and applicable regulations  we are entitled to reimbursement of our costs  plus a profit 
however  if our costs exceed the ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations  we may not be able to recover those costs 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses 
we assume financial risk on time and material contracts because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at negotiated hourly rates 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost plus contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities  but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns and bear the risk of underestimating the level of effort required to perform the contractual obligations  which could result in increased costs and expenses 
our profits could be adversely affected if our costs under any of these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract 
if we acquire other businesses  our contract mix may change 
we may not receive the full amount authorized under our contracts and we may not accurately estimate our backlog 
as of december   our estimated contract backlog totaled approximately billion  of which approximately million was funded 
backlog is our estimate of the remaining future revenues from existing signed contracts  and assume the exercise of all options relating to such contracts 
backlog also includes estimates of revenues for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of executed multiple award contracts  and estimates of revenues from indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
our estimates of future revenues are necessarily inexact  and the receipt and timing of any of these revenues is subject to various contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
the actual accrual of revenues on programs included in backlog and funded backlog may never occur  or may change as a result of a program schedule change  a program cancellation  a contract modification  an option that we had assumed would be exercised not being exercised  or an inaccurate estimate regarding the level of solutions that we are asked to provide 
there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period  or at all  or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable 
there is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog 
in recent years we have derived a significant percentage of our revenues under gsa schedule contracts and task orders  which are procurement vehicles under which government agencies may  but are not required to  purchase professional services or products 
our estimates are based on our experience using such vehicles and similar contracts 
however  there are no assurances that all  or any  of such estimated contract value will be recognized as revenue 

table of contents many of our federal government customers execute their procurement budgets through multiple award contracts under which we are required to compete for post award orders  or for which we may not be eligible to compete  potentially limiting our ability to win new contracts and increase revenue 
budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many us federal government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through multiple award idiq contracts  general services administration gsa schedule contracts and other multiple award and or government wide acquisition contracts gwac vehicles 
these contract vehicles have resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure requiring that we make sustained post award efforts to realize revenues under the relevant contract 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to increase revenues or otherwise sell successfully under these contract vehicles 
our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment could harm our operating results 
failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenues 
in and  we derived and of our revenues  respectively  from contracts in which we acted as a subcontractor to other contractors or to joint ventures that we and other contractors formed to bid on and execute particular contracts or programs 
we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results could be harmed if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or joint venture relationships with us  either because they choose to establish relationships with our competitors or because they choose to directly offer services that compete with our business  or if the government terminates or reduces these other contractors programs or does not award them new contracts 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business could be adversely affected 
sustaining our growth has placed significant demands on our management  as well as on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
to continue to manage our growth  we must continue to improve our operational  financial and management information systems and expand  motivate and manage our workforce 
if we are unable to manage our growth while maintaining our quality of service and profit margins  or if new systems that we implement to assist in managing our growth do not produce the expected benefits  our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates  and we may undertake acquisitions that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 
one of our key operating strategies is to selectively pursue acquisitions 
we have made a number of acquisitions in the past  are currently evaluating a number of potential acquisition opportunities  and will consider other acquisitions in the future 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider appropriate  or finance acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us 
if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition  finance the acquisition or  if the acquisition occurs  integrate the acquired business into our existing business 
negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by diverting management away from day to day operations 
acquisitions of large businesses or other material operations may require additional debt or equity financing  resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership 
if we are unable to successfully integrate companies that we acquire  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
the integration of such businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties including incompatible accounting and information management systems  may absorb significant management attention and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our business 
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
in certain acquisitions  federal acquisition regulations 
table of contents may require us to enter into government novation agreements  a potentially time consuming process 
we also may not realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates 
we may experience attrition  including  but not limited to  key employees of the acquired companies  during and following the integration of the acquired businesses that could reduce our future revenue 
in addition  we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets  which could reduce our future reported earnings 
at times  acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition 
in particular  to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations  or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other clients  we  as the successor owner  may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer harm to our reputation or otherwise be adversely affected 
the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could cause us to incur additional expenses and cause a reduction in our operating profits 
if we fail to recruit and retain skilled employees or employees with the necessary security clearances  we might not be able to perform under our contracts or win new business 
to be competitive  we must have employees who have advanced information technology and technical services skills and who work well with our customers in a government or defense related environment 
these employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees  our ability to maintain and grow our business could be negatively impacted 
in addition  some of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to commit to staff a program with certain personnel the customer considers key to our successful performance under the contract 
in the event we are unable to provide these key personnel or acceptable substitutions  the customer may terminate the contract  and we may not be able to recover certain incurred costs 
we face competition from other firms  many of which have substantially greater resources 
we operate in highly competitive markets and generally encounter intense competition to win contracts 
we compete with many other firms  ranging from small  specialized firms to large  diversified firms  many of which have substantially greater financial  management and marketing resources than we do 
our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications  past contract performance  geographic presence  price and the availability of qualified professional personnel 
our failure to compete effectively with respect to any of these or other factors could cause our revenue and operating profits to decline 
in addition  our competitors also have established or may establish relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address our customers needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge 
mr 
pedersen  our chairman and chief executive officer  effectively controls our company  and his interests may not be aligned with those of other stockholders 
as of december   mr 
pedersen owned approximately of our outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock  and owned or controlled approximately of the combined voting power of our stock 
accordingly  mr 
pedersen controls the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
as long as mr 
pedersen beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock  he will have the ability  without the consent of our public stockholders  to elect all members of our board of directors and to control our management and affairs 
mr 
pedersen s voting control may have the effect of preventing or discouraging transactions involving an actual or a potential change of control of the company  regardless of whether a premium is offered over then current market prices 
mr 
pedersen will be able to cause a change of control of the company 
mr 
pedersen could also cause a registration statement to be filed and to become effective under the securities act of  thereby permitting him to freely sell or transfer the shares of common stock that he owns 
in addition  the interests of mr 
pedersen may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock 

table of contents the loss of any member of our senior management could impair our customer relationships and disrupt the management of our business 
we believe that our success depends in part on the continued contributions of our co founder  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer  george j 
pedersen  our president and chief operating officer  robert a 
coleman  our chief financial officer  kevin m 
phillips  our senior executive vice president  eugene c 
renzi  and other members of our senior management 
we rely on our executive officers and senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully 
furthermore  the relationships and reputation that members of our management team have established and maintain with government and military personnel contribute to our ability to maintain good customer relations and to identify new business opportunities 
the loss of mr 
pedersen  mr 
coleman  mr 
phillips  mr 
renzi or any other senior management personnel could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts  to maintain good customer relationships and otherwise to manage our business 
we may be liable for systems and service failures 
we create  implement and maintain information technology and technical services solutions that are often critical to our customers operations  including those of federal  state and local governments 
we have experienced and may in the future experience some systems and service failures  schedule or delivery delays and other problems in connection with our work 
if our solutions  services  products or other applications have significant defects or errors  are subject to delivery delays or fail to meet our customers expectations  we may lose revenues due to adverse customer reaction  be required to provide additional services to a customer at no charge  receive negative publicity  which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers  and suffer claims for substantial damages against us 
in addition to any costs resulting from product warranties  contract performance or required corrective action  these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenues if they result in customers postponing subsequently scheduled work or canceling or failing to renew contracts 
while many of our contracts with the federal government limit our liability for damages that may arise from negligence in rendering services to our customers  we cannot be sure that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages if we are sued 
furthermore  our errors and omissions and product liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims 
the successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business 
even if not successful  these claims could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to our management and may harm our reputation 
covenants in our credit facility may restrict our financial and operating flexibility 
we maintain a credit facility with citizens bank of pennsylvania  keybank national association  branch banking and trust company of virginia  chevy chase bank  fsb  and riggs bank  fsb our agreement initially provides for a million revolving credit facility that can be increased to million 
the maturity date of the agreement is february  our credit facility contains covenants that limit or restrict our ability to borrow additional money  merge or consolidate  sell or dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business  make acquisitions  enter into related party transactions  pay dividends  and make certain capital expenditures 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial covenants relating to asset coverage  fixed charge coverage  and debt coverage ratios 
our ability to satisfy these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios 
default under our credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we 
table of contents have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the lenders declare amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be due  the lenders could proceed against those assets 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business if the creditors determine to exercise their rights 
we also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility  restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or subject us to other events of default 
from time to time we may require consents or waivers from our lenders to permit actions that are prohibited by our credit facility 
if our lenders refuse to provide waivers of our credit facility s restrictive covenants and or financial ratios  then we may be in default under our credit facility  and we may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain and expand our business 
security breaches in classified government systems could adversely affect our business 
many of the programs we support and systems we develop  install and maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in intelligence  national security and other classified government functions 
while we have programs designed to comply with relevant security laws  regulations and restrictions  a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  damage our reputation and prevent us from being eligible for further work on critical classified systems for federal government customers 
losses that we could incur from such a security breach could exceed the policy limits that we have for errors and omissions or product liability insurance 
damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of the systems we develop  install and maintain could materially reduce our revenue 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future 
a number of factors cause our revenues  cash flow and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter  including fluctuations in revenues earned on fixed price contracts and contracts with a performance based fee structure  commencement  completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter  timing of award or performance incentive fee notices  timing of significant bid and proposal costs  variable purchasing patterns under government gsa schedule contracts  blanket purchase agreements and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs and joint ventures  seasonal fluctuations in our staff utilization rates  changes in presidential administrations and senior federal government officials that affect the timing of technology procurement  changes in federal government policy or budgetary measures that adversely affect government contracts in general  and increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials in connection with the federal government s fiscal year end  which may affect our quarter operating results 
because a relatively large amount of our expenses are fixed  cash flows from our operations may vary significantly as a result of changes in the volume of services provided under existing contracts and the number of contracts that are commenced  completed or terminated during any quarter 
we incur significant operating 
table of contents expenses during the start up and early stages of large contracts  and typically we do not receive corresponding payments in that same quarter 
we may also incur significant or unanticipated expenses when a contract expires  terminates or is not renewed 
payments due to us from federal government agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures of governmental budgets to gain congressional and administration approval in a timely manner 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a federal budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year  our clients may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
any such suspensions may reduce our revenue in the fourth quarter of that year or the first quarter of the subsequent year 
the federal government s fiscal year end can also trigger increased purchase requests from clients for equipment and materials 
any increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the federal government s fiscal year end would serve to increase our third or fourth quarter revenue  but may decrease profit margins for that quarter  as these activities generally may not be as profitable as our typical offerings 
our business depends upon obtaining and maintaining required security clearances 
many of our federal government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances  and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances complying with department of defense requirements 
obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process  and it is difficult to identify  recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances 
if our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances or if our employees who hold security clearances terminate employment with us  the customer whose work requires cleared employees could terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration 
in addition  we expect that many of the contracts on which we will bid will require us to demonstrate our ability to obtain facility security clearances and perform work with employees who hold specified types of security clearances 
to the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract  we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts  or effectively rebid on expiring contracts 
our employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  which could cause us to lose contracts 
while we have ethics and compliance programs in place  we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
additionally  from time to time we enter into arrangements with subcontractors and joint venture partners to bid on and execute particular contracts or programs  as a result  we are exposed to the risk that fraud or other misconduct or improper activities by such persons may occur 
misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could include intentional failures to comply with federal laws  federal government procurement regulations or the terms of contracts that we receive  falsifying time records or failures to disclose unauthorized or unsuccessful activities to us 
these actions could lead to civil  criminal  and or administrative penalties including fines  imprisonment  suspension and or debarment from performing federal government contracts and harm our reputation 
misconduct by our employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could also involve the improper collection  handling or use of our customers sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation 
we have from time to time experienced occurrences of misconduct and improper activities by our employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
it is not always possible to deter misconduct by our employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
under certain circumstances  conduct of our employees can be imputed to the mantech subsidiary for which they work and the conduct of mantech subsidiaries can be imputed to mantech international corporation with the consequence that mantech international corporation could be subject to sanctions and penalties for actions taken by our subsidiaries and or the employees of our subsidiaries 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  and such misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could result in serious civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or harm to our reputation  which could cause us to lose contracts or cause a reduction in revenue 

table of contents we may be harmed by intellectual property infringement claims 
we may be subject to claims from our employees or third parties who assert that software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that we used in delivering services and solutions to our customers infringe upon intellectual property rights of such employees or third parties 
if our vendors  our employees or third parties assert claims that we or our customers are infringing on their intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of these infringement claims are ultimately successful  we could be required to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  obtain a license or additional licenses  or redesign our products and services that rely on the challenged software or technology

the lease on this facility expires in march as of december   we leased additional operating facilities throughout the metropolitan washington  dc area and facilities in other parts of the united states 
we also have employees working at customer sites throughout the united states and in other countries 
during  we acquired two office buildings total of  square feet and another smaller building on approximately acres of land in king george  va for million

lease expiration dates range from years through 
table of contents item legal proceedings we are subject to certain legal proceedings  government audits  investigations  claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
like most large government defense contractors  our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by an in house staff of auditors from the defense contract auditing agency 
in addition to these routine audits  we are subject from time to time to audits and investigations by other agencies of the federal government 
these audits and investigations are conducted to determine if our performance and administration of our government contracts are compliant with contractual requirements and applicable federal statutes and regulations 
an audit or investigation may result in a finding that our performance  systems and administration is compliant or  alternatively  may result in the government initiating proceedings against us or our employees  including administrative proceedings seeking repayment of monies  suspension and or debarment from doing business with the federal government or a particular agency  or civil or criminal proceedings seeking penalties and or fines 
audits and investigations conducted by the federal government frequently span several years 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these and other legal proceedings  investigations  claims and disputes  based on the information now available to us  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results

as of march   there were twenty seven holders of record of our class a common stock and four holders of record of our class b common stock 
the number of holders of record of our class a common stock is not representative of the number of beneficial holders because many of the shares are held by depositories  brokers or nominees 
dividend policy currently  we intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and growth of our business 
in addition  our credit facility restricts us from paying cash dividends to holders of our common stock 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
no dividends have been declared on any class of our common stock since our initial public offering in any future dividends declared would be at the discretion of our board of directors and would depend  among other factors  upon our results of operations  financial condition and cash requirements  and the terms of our credit facility and other financing agreements at the time such payment is considered

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
this discussion addresses only our continuing operations  except in the discussion under the heading  discontinued operations 
for more information on our discontinued operations  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community  the departments of defense  state  homeland security  and justice  and other us federal government agencies 
our expertise includes engineering  systems integration  software services  enterprise architecture  information assurance and security architecture  intelligence operations and analysis support  network and critical infrastructure protection  information operations and computer forensics  information technology  communications integration and engineering support 
with approximately  highly qualified employees  we operate in the united states and over countries worldwide 
we derive revenue primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security and as a result  funding for our programs is generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence and homeland security 
leading up to and following the terrorist events of september   the us government substantially increased its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
in  our revenue increased mainly as a result of the expansion of our work with intelligence agencies in us  efforts involving telecommunications  infrastructure  maintenance  repair and sustainment support provided in military deployed environments with us and allied forces in support of peace keeping efforts worldwide  support to the state department  and the acquisitions that occurred in the past two years  including gray hawk systems  inc in may  and two operations from acs in for the three years ended december   over of our revenues were derived from our customers in the intelligence community and the department of defense 
these customers include the office of the secretary of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  various intelligence agencies  joint intelligence task forces  the us army  navy  air force and marine corps and joint military commands 
we also provide solutions to federal government civilian agencies  including the department of justice  nasa  and epa  as well as to state and local governments and commercial customers 
the following table shows our revenue from each type of customer as a percentage of our total revenue for the period shown 
years ended december  department of defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state agencies and commercial entities total revenue our services and solutions are provided under three types of contracts time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price 
our contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors including our business strategies and federal government procurement objectives 
the following table shows our revenue from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods shown 
years ended december  cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price total revenue 
table of contents time and materials contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may be either greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract  and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
these contracts are generally less than six months in duration 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues are recognized as those products are delivered and accepted 
we have derived a substantial majority of our revenues from governmental contracts under which we act as a prime contractor 
we also provide services indirectly as a subcontractor 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods years ended december  prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government  primarily by our employees and  to a lesser extent  our subcontractors 
in some cases  our revenue includes third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions 
the level of hardware and software purchases we make for clients may vary from period to period depending on specific contract and client requirements 
since we earn higher profits from labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for clients  we seek to optimize our labor services on all of our engagements 

table of contents operating expenses cost of services cost of services primarily includes direct costs incurred to provide our services and solutions to customers 
the most significant portion of these costs are direct labor costs  including salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees directly serving customers  in addition to the related management  facilities and infrastructure costs 
cost of services also includes other direct costs such as the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants  and third party materials  such as hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of an integrated solution 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party material 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to increase 
changes in the mix of services and equipment provided under our contracts can result in variability in our contract margins 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits including stock based compensation  of our employees not performing work directly for clients 
among the functions covered by these costs are facilities  corporate business development  bid and proposal  contracts administration  finance and accounting  legal  corporate governance  and executive and senior management 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of computers  furniture and other equipment  the amortization of third party software we use internally  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
non compete agreements are generally amortized straight line over the term of the agreement  while contracts and related client relationships are amortized proportionately against the acquired backlog 
interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest expense incurred or accrued under our outstanding borrowings and notes payable and  to a lesser extent  our interest rate swap agreement  deferred financing charges and interest on capital leases 
provision for income taxes we estimate our effective income tax rate to be approximately  and for the years ended  and  respectively

gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the decrease in gross profit margin is due to a less profitable mix of direct labor and other direct costs including subcontractors and material purchases partially offset by a reduction  as a percentage of revenue  in direct labor and overhead costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  which is less then the growth of revenue for the same period 
the increased expenses reflect additional management personnel and infrastructure  increased bid and proposal efforts  and expenses related to our acquisitions to support the continued growth of our business

loss from discontinued operations in february  we reached the determination to sell our msm subsidiary after we concluded that the msm business no longer furthered our long term strategic objectives 
currently  we intend to sell msm as a going concern and are in discussions with potential buyers 
we expect to complete the sale or other disposition of the msm operations by the end of the second quarter of at december   we recorded a loss accrual of million on the valuation of these assets based on offers received from potential buyers in early the loss accrual reflects the write off of intangible assets including goodwill  net of taxes 
the loss also reflects a valuation allowance of million for deferred state income tax assets related to net operating losses carried forward  which are not expected to be realized 
net losses from msm were million and million for and  respectively 
in  msm had net income of million

our effective tax rate for years ended december  and was and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase is largely attributable to several factors  including million in revenue from the acquisition of operations from acs in the first and second quarters of  a full year versus ten months of

backlog for the years ended  and our backlog was billion  billion  and billion respectively  of which million  million  and million  respectively  was funded backlog 
backlog and funded backlog represent estimates that we calculate on a consistent basis 
the acquisition of gray hawk systems inc contributed approximately million to backlog for the year ended several significant contract wins  including a competitive award to support the us army in iraq and afghanistan and several significant classified awards occurring in bolstered our backlog at december we estimate that approximately to of our total backlog will be recognized as revenues prior to december  effects of inflation we generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner to accommodate the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
under our time and materials contracts  labor rates are usually adjusted annually by predetermined escalation factors 
our cost reimbursable contracts automatically adjust for changes in cost 
under our fixed price contracts  we include a predetermined escalation factor  but generally  we have not been adversely affected by inflation

the maximum available borrowing under our credit facility at december  was million 
generally  cash provided by operating activities is adequate to fund our operations 
due to fluctuations in our cash flows and the growth in our operations  it is necessary from time to time to increase borrowings under our credit facility to meet cash demands

the increase in over the previous year is primarily related to final dividends from our investment in our vosper mantech joint venture of million and a net cash inflow from discontinued operations of million 
in  discontinued operations used cash of million 
the positive cash flow in discontinued operations for is due to the collection of all outstanding receivables on our defense security services contract

table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies listed below  are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition and cost estimation we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
our revenues consist primarily of services provided by our employees  and to a lesser extent  the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation  and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
we derive the majority of our revenue from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price  or time and materials contracts 
revenues for cost reimbursement contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  that are subject to the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered  or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts which are specifically described in the scope section of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or other appropriate accounting literature we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired companies 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 and no longer amortize goodwill  rather  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have elected to perform this review annually during the second quarter of each calendar year and no adjustments were necessary 
for acquisitions completed prior to the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from two to twenty years 
as noted above in our discussion of discontinued operations above  we recorded at december  a loss accrual for the impairment of goodwill related to msm 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which will require the compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective january  for the company 
we will adopt the modified prospective method for reporting utilizing the black scholes model for valuing our stock based compensation on date of grant 
information about the fair value of stock options under the black scholes model and its pro forma impact on the company s net earnings and earnings per share for the historical periods is illustrated in note of our financial statements under stock based compensation disclosure 
we expect the impact of implementing the new standard will be a reduction in diluted earnings per share of approximately to for the fiscal year ending december  the new pronouncement will also require excess tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options be reported in the statement of cash flows as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities 
as of december   all of our grants under the plan had a year contractual life 
for future grants  we intend to shorten the contractual life to years 
at december   we had approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense for awards outstanding to be amortized ratably over the remaining service period less an estimate for forfeitures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
these borrowings bear interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense for the year ended december  by less than million
