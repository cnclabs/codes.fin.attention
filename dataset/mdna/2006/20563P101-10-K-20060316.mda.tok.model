item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company reported operating income of million in compared to operating income of million in and million in as more fully described below  the company s operating income increased from to as the favorable effect of higher sales in and the company s ongoing focus on reducing costs more than offset the negative impact of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s operating income increased from to due primarily to the higher sales in and improved margins in through cost reduction efforts 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales in as compared to by million  but negatively impacted operating income by million 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales in as compared to by million  but negatively impacted operating income by 
million 
the impact on net sales is primarily due to the strengthening canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
the impact on operating income is primarily from the company s canadian operations  where the majority of net sales are denominated in us dollars while the majority of expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in primarily due to changes in tax liabilities as a result of the improvement in taxable income in and critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical financial statement judgment risks of its business are attributable to four primary areas o will customer accounts receivable on the books be collected at full book value o will inventory on hand be sold with a sufficient mark up to cover the cost to produce and ship the product o will future cash flows of the company be sufficient to recover the net book value of long lived assets o will future taxable income be sufficient to utilize recorded deferred income tax assets the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates  as noted above  used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of the company s operating segments o allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of the customers  the age of outstanding balances and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowances 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  increased allowances may be required 
o inventory reserves 
the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company also considers the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  increased inventory reserves may be required 
o net book value of long lived assets 
the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of the long lived asset is not probable 
the determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of the company s annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each such reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values of these three reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that such operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
in december  the company s thomas regout operations met the criteria under gaap to be classified as held for sale and thus was required to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
at such time  the company recognized a million impairment of the goodwill related to such operations  as the carrying amount of the net assets exceeded the estimated fair value less cost to sell of the operations 
the disposal of such operations was completed in january  and therefore the company no longer reports goodwill attributable to such operations at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no impairment indicators were present with respect to the company s property and equipment 
o deferred income tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized 
this would result in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate is made 
in addition  the company makes an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while the company may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of its foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  the company would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us in this regard  during compx determined that certain of the undistributed earnings of its non us operations could no longer be considered permanently reinvested  and in accordance with gaap compx recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on such undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the company s operating segments are defined as components of its operations about which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the company currently has three operating segments security products  precision slides and ergonomics 
the security products segment  with manufacturing facilities in south carolina and illinois  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sale to the office furniture  banking  vending  computer and other various industries 
in august  compx completed the acquisition of a component products business 
the results of the component products business acquired  which are not material  are included with the security products segment in the tables that follow 
the precision slides segment  with facilities in canada  michigan and taiwan  manufactures and distributes a complete line of precision ball bearing slides for use in office furniture  computer related equipment  tool storage cabinets and other applications 
the ergonomics segment manufactures and distributes ergonomic computer support systems for office furniture from a facility in canada that it shares with the precision slides segment 
prior to  the company had aggregated the precision slides and ergonomics operating segments into a single reportable segment  compx waterloo  because of the integrated facility used by the two businesses and the similar economic characteristics  customer types  production processes  and distribution methods 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to measure the ergonomics business as a separate operating unit and develop appropriate allocations relating to certain shared expenses in order to disaggregate the operating results 
disaggregated information is not available for the year ended december  due to the impracticality of allocating certain historical expenses that are shared between the two segments 
therefore  aggregated segment amounts are reported for precision slides ergonomics for all periods presented as well as the disaggregated information for and net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales precision slides security products ergonomics total net sales operating income precision slides security products ergonomics total operating income operating income margin precision slides security products ergonomics total operating income margin years ended december  change in millions net sales precision slides ergonomics security products total net sales operating income loss precision slides ergonomics nm security products total operating income operating income loss margin precision slides ergonomics security products total operating income margin nm not meaningful year ended december  compared to year ended december  currency 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the precision slides and ergonomics segments  and do not materially affect the security products segment 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted the company s sales comparisons with  and negatively impacted the company s operating income comparisons for the same periods 
the positive impact on sales relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translating into higher non us dollar sales due to a strengthening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the negative impact on operating income results from the us dollar denominated sales of non us operations converting into lower local currency amounts due to the weakening of the us dollar 
this negatively impacts margin as it results in less local currency generated from sales to cover the costs of non us operations which are denominated in local currency 
net sales were positively impacted while operating income was negatively impacted by currency exchange rates in the following amounts by segment as compared to the currency exchange rates in effect during precision security slides products ergonomics total impact on net sales   impact on operating income   net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to principally due to increases in selling prices for certain products across all segments to recover volatile raw material prices  sales volume associated with the business acquired in  and the net effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates as discussed above  partially offset by sales volume decreases for certain products resulting from asian competition 
net sales of slide products in decreased as compared to  while net sales of security products increased and net sales of ergonomic products decreased as compared to the same period 
the percentage changes in slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
costs of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold was flat in compared to  although net sales increased during the same period 
the resulting improvement in gross margin is primarily due to the ongoing favorable impact of a continuous focus on reducing costs partially offset by the negative impact of currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense was in each of and  respectively 
operating income 
operating income for increased million  or compared to and operating margins increased to in compared to for continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs were partially offset by the effects of the changes in currency exchange rates and higher raw material costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  currency 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar positively impacted the company s sales comparisons with principally with respect to slide products  and negatively impacted the company s operating income comparisons for the same period 
net sales were positively impacted while operating income was negatively impacted by currency exchange rates in the following amounts as compared to precision security slides products ergonomics total impact on net sales   impact on operating income net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to principally due to increases in product prices for precision slides and ergonomic products  which were primarily a pass through of steel cost increases to customers 
additionally  currency exchange rates favorably impacted sales within the precision slides and ergonomic product segments 
net sales of slide products in increased as compared to  while net sales of security products decreased less than and net sales of ergonomic products increased as compared to the same period 
the percentage changes in slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
costs of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold was flat in compared to  although net sales increased during the same period 
the resulting improvement in gross margin was due to the full year impact of cost improvement initiatives completed during partially offset by the negative impact of the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates and increases in the cost of steel  the primary raw material for the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expense 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense increased slightly from of net sales in to in a significant portion of the increase was due to costs relating to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of operating income 
operating income for increased million  or compared to and operating margins increased to in compared to for continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs were partially offset by the effects of the changes in currency exchange rates and increases in certain raw material costs primarily steel 
general the company s profitability primarily depends on its ability to utilize its production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for its products and its ability to control its manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel and plastic resins 
raw material costs represent approximately of the company s total cost of sales 
during  and  worldwide steel prices increased significantly 
the company occasionally enters into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not commit the company to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows the company to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
the company enters into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins 
the company anticipates further significant changes in the cost of these materials  primarily coiled steel  from their current levels for the next year 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by the company s products  it is often difficult to recover such increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by such raw material cost pressures 
other general corporate income expense  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other general corporate income expense  net primarily includes interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and includes interest income on long term intercompany notes receivable from the european thomas regout operations of million and million  respectively 
upon the sale of the thomas regout european operations in january  the intercompany notes receivable were extinguished and therefore no such interest income was recorded during interest expense interest expense declined 
million in compared to and declined 
million in compared to due primarily to lower average levels of borrowing on compx s revolving bank credit facility  partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense in is expected to be comparable to provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between compx s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
compx became a member of contran s consolidated us federal income tax group the contran tax group in october as a member of the contran tax group  compx computes its provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
one such election is whether to claim a deduction or a tax credit against us taxable income with respect to foreign income taxes paid 
during the first nine months of  and prior to compx becoming a member of the contran tax group  compx was able to claim a tax credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid 
consistent with elections of the contran tax group  in compx is not claiming a credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid but instead is claiming a tax deduction 
this has resulted in an increase in the company s effective income tax rate for compared to under gaap  a company is required to recognize a deferred income tax liability with respect to the incremental us income taxes federal and state and foreign withholding taxes that would be incurred when undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary are subsequently repatriated  unless management has determined that those undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 
prior to the third quarter of  compx had not recognized a deferred tax liability related to such incremental income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign operations  as those earnings were deemed to be permanently reinvested 
gaap requires a company to reassess the permanent reinvestment conclusion on an ongoing basis to determine if management s intentions have changed 
as of september   and based primarily upon changes in management s strategic plans for certain of compx s non us operations  management determined that the undistributed earnings of such subsidiaries could no longer be considered to be permanently reinvested except for the pre earnings in taiwan 
accordingly  and in accordance with gaap  in the company recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the aggregate undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries 
the company generated a million tax benefit in associated with the us capital loss realized in the first quarter of upon the completion of the sale of the thomas regout operations 
however  the company has determined that realization of such benefit does not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria and therefore  the deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at december  and december  the deferred income tax benefit and the offsetting valuation allowance are both reflected as a component of discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions compx is a party to certain transactions with related parties 
it is the policy of the company to engage in transactions with related parties on terms  in the opinion of the company  no less favorable to the company than could be obtained from unrelated parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting principles not yet adopted see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook while demand has stabilized across most product segments  certain customers continue to seek lower cost asian sources as alternatives to the company s products 
compx believes the impact of this will be mitigated through ongoing initiatives to expand both new products and new market opportunities 
asian sourced competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge as asian manufacturers  particularly those located in china  gain market share 
the company s strategy in responding to the competitive pricing pressure has included reducing production cost through product reengineering  improvement in manufacturing processes or moving production to lower cost facilities  including its own asian based manufacturing facilities 
the company also has emphasized and focused on opportunities where it can provide value added customer support services that asian based manufacturers are generally unable to provide 
the combination of the company s cost control initiatives together with its value added approach to development and marketing of products are believed to help mitigate the impact of competitive pricing pressures 
the company will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales  particularly to the office furniture industry  and to develop value added customer relationships with an additional focus on sales of the company s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems and security products to improve operating results 
in addition  the company continues to develop sources for lower cost components for certain product lines to strengthen its ability to meet competitive pricing when practical 
these actions  along with other activities to eliminate excess capacity  are designed to position the company to expand more effectively on both new product and new market opportunities to improve company profitability 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital or capital expenditure purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  the company will incur indebtedness  primarily for short term working capital needs  or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
in addition  from time to time  the company may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for  and have generally been similar to the trends in the company s earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to due to timing that capital expenditures were placed into service during versus as well as the effect of the january disposal of the thomas regout operations in europe 
depreciation and amortization expense also decreased in compared to due to lower capital expenditures during as the company reduced its production capacity 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily the result of changes in tax liabilities due to the improvement in taxable income in and the company s average days sales outstanding related to its continuing operations increased from days at december  to days at december  due to the timing of collection over the slightly higher accounts receivable balance at the end of the company s average number of days in inventory related to its continuing operations was days at december  and days at december  the increase in days in inventory is primarily due to higher raw material prices  primarily steel 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures in the past three years emphasized manufacturing equipment which utilize new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
in august  compx completed an acquisition of a company for million  net of cash acquired 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   compx completed the disposition of all of the net assets of its thomas regout precision slide and window furnishing operations  conducted at its facility in the netherlands  to members of thomas regout management for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds consisted of cash net of costs to sell of approximately million and a subordinated note for approximately million 
the subordinated note requires annual payments over a period of four years 
historically  the thomas regout european operations have not contributed significantly to net cash flows from operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the company received approximately million from the sale of its surplus trillium facility in ontario  canada  which approximated the net carrying value of such facility 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million  the majority of which relates to projects that emphasize improved production efficiency including replacement of equipment that is being retired 
firm purchase commitments for capital projects in process at december  approximated million 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
total cash dividends paid in each of and were million 
per share and million was paid in 
per share 
the company suspended its regular quarterly dividend in the second quarter of and reinstated the regular quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of the company repaid a net million  million and nil under its revolving bank credit facility during  and  respectively 
the company closed on an extension of its credit facility in december the million secured revolving bank credit facility is collateralized by of the ownership interests in the company s first tier non united states subsidiaries 
provisions contained in the revolving bank credit agreement could result in the acceleration of outstanding indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  the company s credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither compx nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared 
to the extent that the company s actual operating results or other developments differ from the company s expectations  compx s liquidity could be adversely affected 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  its capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  the company may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands long term debt  operating leases purchase obligations   income taxes   fixed asset acquisitions   total contractual cash obligations   the timing and amount shown for the company s commitments related to long term debt  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates or interest rates at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  the company had no amounts outstanding under its secured revolving bank credit agreement  and the company s remaining indebtedness outstanding is not material 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as already mentioned certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx held a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn 
per us dollar 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding currency forward contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such contracts is not material at december  and other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
