table of contents critical accounting policies and procedures general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to client programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and commitments and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is generated primarily through software and system sales  support and maintenance  and other services 
the company recognizes revenue using the guidance from aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts arb  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
under these guidelines  the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and remaining obligations under the agreement are insignificant 
under multiple element arrangements  where each element is separately stated  sold and priced  the company allocates revenues to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
the company s vsoe of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  the company recognizes revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  a delivered element without vsoe of fair value is recognized as revenue if all undelivered elements have vsoe of fair value 
the company generally sells its products  which include both software licenses and hardware  directly to end users and resellers 
revenue from software licenses and system sales is generally recognized as products are shipped  provided that no significant vendor obligations remain and that the collection of the related receivable is probable 
for those agreements that provide for significant services or custom development that are essential to the software s functionality  the software license and contracted services are recognized under the percentage of completion method as prescribed by the provisions of arb and sop the company offers its clients post contract support in the form of maintenance  telephone support and unspecified software enhancements 
revenue from support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
the company s services revenue consists of professional fees generated from consulting  custom development  installation and training 
revenue related to professional services performed by the company is generally recognized on a time and materials basis as the services are performed 
under contracts where revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method under the provisions of sop  the company measures its progress to completion by using input measures  primarily labor hours 
the company continually updates and revises estimates of its input measures 
if those estimates indicate a loss will be incurred  the entire loss is recognized in that period 
in addition  the company offers its customers subscription pricing and hosting services for some of its products 
under these subscription based contracts  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period commencing  generally  when the product has been installed and training has been completed 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific client accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  client inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
capitalized software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company s policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of license fees 
capitalization of such costs begins when a detail program or a working model has been produced as evidenced by the completion of design  planning  coding and testing  such that the product meets its design specifications and has thereby established technological feasibility 
capitalization of such costs ends when the resulting product is available for general release to the public 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which the company has determined is not more than five years 
management is required to use its judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
additionally  management is required to use its judgment in the valuation of the unamortized capitalized software costs in determining whether the recorded value is recoverable based on future product sales 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets and finite lived identifiable intangibles not held for sale whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition  or an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset 
the company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is measured based on quoted market prices  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles as well as capitalized software costs 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
for intangible assets  this evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives  the company will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit which houses goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
the fair value of the reporting units is based upon the net present value of future cash flows  including a terminal value calculation 
if the reporting units estimated fair value exceeds the reporting units carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value  then further analysis would be required to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
if the company determines that there is an impairment in either an intangible asset  or goodwill  the company may be required to record an impairment charge in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined  which may have a negative impact on earnings
