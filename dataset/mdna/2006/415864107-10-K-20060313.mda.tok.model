executive overview the company s revenues were a record billion 
this is an increase of billion or over income from continuing operations was a record million for compared with million in  an increase of 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record for  a increase from all four of the company s operating groups showed improved full year results over the prior year 
the results were led by the access services segment and the engineered products and services all other category as a result of strong end markets  margin improvements and share gains 
the mill services segment delivered increased sales and operating income despite essentially flat global steel production excluding china  higher fuel costs and the timing of new contract signings 
the gas technologies segment experienced some moderating raw material cost inflation  in several product lines  that benefited operating income compared with additionally  in the fourth quarter of  the company completed two strategic bolt on acquisitions  one in the access services segment on november h nnebeck group gmbh  and one in the mill services segment on december the northern hemisphere mill services operations of brambles industrial services bisnh 
during  the company had record net cash provided by operating activities of million  a increase over the million achieved in for  the company has set a target of million for net cash provided by operating activities  a increase over the record level 
the company s cash flows are further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
the record revenue  income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for demonstrate the balance and geographic diversity of the company s operations 
the company s mill services  access services and gas technologies segments  as well as the engineered products and services all other category all delivered improved results 
this operating balance and geographic diversity provides a broad foundation for future growth opportunities and a hedge against normal changes in economic and industrial cycles 
segment overview revenues for for the mill services segment were billion compared with billion in  a increase 
operating income increased by to million  from million in operating margins for this segment decreased by basis points to from in due to higher energy costs and production cutbacks in the last half of by certain steel mill customers 
a benefit from the gain on the sale of certain assets related to exiting an underperforming contract was mostly offset by the impact of higher severance costs 
this segment accounted for of the company s revenues and of the operating income for the access services segment s revenues in were million compared with million in  a increase 
operating income increased by to million  from million in operating margins for the segment improved by basis points to from in these improvements were due to increased rental equipment utilization  better non residential construction market conditions  market share gains  improved pricing  particularly in the united states  and million of pre tax gains from the disposal of assets related to the closing of a branch location and the sale of the youngman light access manufacturing business 
this segment accounted for of the company s revenues and of the operating income for improved performance was achieved by both the international and domestic access services operations 
the gas technologies segment s revenues in were million compared with million in  a increase 
operating income increased by to million  from million in the increased revenues in were led by the industrial cylinder and cryogenics equipment businesses 
as expected  operating income and margins were positively affected in by moderating commodity cost increases  particularly steel  compared with this segment accounted for of the company s revenues and of the operating income for four of the five businesses in the engineered products and services all other category contributed higher revenues  operating income and operating margins in compared with the railway track maintenance services and equipment business delivered record revenues in through increased contracting services activity and strong equipment and repair parts sales 
the air cooled heat exchangers business also experienced improved market conditions that have resulted in increased volumes and backlogs 
the industrial grating products business had improved revenues and operating income due to increased demand partially due to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita and  to a lesser extent  higher prices and an improved product mix 
the roofing granules and abrasives business and the boiler and process equipment business delivered solid performances in  consistent with the prior year 
the positive effect of foreign currency translation increased consolidated revenues by million and pre tax income by million when compared with outlook overview the company s operations span several industries and products as more fully discussed in part i  item  business 
on a macro basis  the company is affected by worldwide steel mill production and capacity utilization  non residential construction and industrial maintenance activities  industrial production volume  and the general business trend towards the outsourcing of services 
the overall outlook for continues to be positive for these business drivers 
the company s mill services segment expects to benefit from gradually increasing steel production at mills served by the company  new contract signings and a full year of accretion from the december  acquisition of bisnh 
however  the company also expects to experience continued increased energy costs that may have a negative effect on operating margins  to the extent these costs cannot be passed to customers 
both domestic and international access services activity remains strong 
although the sale of the youngman light access manufacturing business in late will modestly affect revenues  improvements to operating performance in for the segment are expected to be led by a full year of accretion from the november  h nnebeck acquisition  increased non residential construction spending and industrial maintenance activity in the company s major markets  continued development of new markets  further market penetration from new products  product cross selling opportunities among the markets served by the three access services businesses  and cost reduction opportunities through consolidated procurement initiatives 
in the gas technologies segment for  demand for industrial cylinders and cryogenics equipment is expected to show continued improvement 
the propane business is expected to return to a more normal business cycle in comparison to the prior two years  and an overall improvement in the valves business is expected 
international operations are expected to continue to perform well 
however  the risk remains that certain commodity cost inflation and the availability of certain raw materials could adversely affect this segment s results 
the outlook for the engineered products and services all other category remains positive for the company s railway track maintenance services and equipment business income and margins are expected to continue to benefit from the shift toward contract services  with several major contracts scheduled to start in the air cooled heat exchangers business is expected to continue to benefit from strong end market demand due to increased natural gas drilling and transmission 
while not expecting a repeat of the same level of benefits from post katrina rebuilding experienced in the second half of  the industrial grating products business is expected to post another year of solid  stable results in  as are the roofing granules and abrasives and the boiler and process equipment businesses 
the stable or improved market conditions for most of the company s services and products and the significant investments made for acquisitions and growth related capital expenditures provide a solid base for achieving the company s stated objective of growth in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in revenues by region total revenues twelve months ended december percentage growth from to dollars in millions volume currency total north america europe middle east and africa latin america asia pacific total highlights the following significant items impacted the company overall during in comparison with company wide strong worldwide economic activity benefited the company in this included increased access equipment sales and rentals  especially in the us  middle east and europe  increased global demand for railway track maintenance services and equipment  and increased demand for air cooled heat exchangers  industrial cylinders  cryogenics equipment and industrial grating products 
during the first half of  the company s mill services segment benefited from strong steel production activity  however  during the second half of  steel production at certain mills served by this segment declined  negatively impacting results 
as expected  during  the company experienced an overall leveling off of commodity cost increases particularly steel  however  fuel and energy related costs and certain other commodity costs continued to increase 
to the extent that such costs cannot be passed to customers in the future  operating income may be adversely affected 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of inventory accounting for most of its manufacturing businesses 
lifo matches the most recently incurred costs with current revenues by charging cost of goods sold with the costs of goods most recently acquired or produced 
in periods of rising prices  reported costs under lifo are generally greater than under the first in  first out fifo method 
based on current economic forecasts  cost inflation for certain commodities used by the company is expected to increase slightly in  although fuel and energy related costs are expected to continue to increase at a higher rate 
however  there can be no assurance that will occur 
total pension expense for decreased million from defined benefit pension expense for decreased approximately million from due to plan structural changes implemented in recent years 
during  the defined benefit pension expense decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately million and million in defined contribution plan and multi employer plan expenses  respectively 
the company is currently taking additional actions to further reduce pension expense volatility 
this is more fully discussed in the outlook  trends and strategies section 
net other expenses for included million in net gains on the sale of non core assets  mostly offset by million in employee termination benefit costs 
this compares with million in net gains on the sale of assets and million in employee termination benefit costs in during  international sales and income were and  respectively  of total sales and income 
this compares with the levels of of sales and of income 
the international percentages are expected to increase in as a result of the late h nnebeck and bisnh acquisitions 
mill services segment dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent mill services segment significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues increased volume and new business benefit of positive foreign currency translation acquisition principally evulca sas in france a revenues a since bisnh was acquired on december   it did not have a significant effect on operations 
mill services segment significant impacts on operating income operating income for increased slightly as a result of increased pricing for certain contracts and new business  particularly in europe and brazil  mostly offset by increased operating costs as noted below and reduced volume in south africa and north america during the majority of compared with  the segment s operating income and margins in were negatively impacted by increased fuel and energy related costs of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative costs increased million for including approximately million related to foreign currency translation 
these increases related primarily to increased compensation costs 
the benefit of positive foreign currency translation in resulted in increased operating income of million compared with access services segment dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent access services segment significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues net increased volume mostly us  middle east and continental europe net effect of acquisitions and divestitures h nnebeck and sgb raffia in australia acquired in april offset by the youngman light access manufacturing unit divestiture impact of negative foreign currency translation other revenues access services segment significant impacts on operating income in  there was a continued strengthening in the us non residential construction markets that started in the latter half of during  the value of rental equipment on customer job sites was at an all time high 
this had a positive effect on volume particularly equipment rentals which caused overall margins in the us to improve 
equipment rentals  particularly in the construction sector  provide the highest margins for this segment 
the international access services business continued to increase outside the uk  predominantly in the middle east and europe  due to certain on going large projects as well as the h nnebeck acquisition 
during  the international operations outside of the uk had million in revenues and million in operating income 
this compares with million in revenues and million in operating income for during  the segment was favorably affected by pre tax income of million from the disposal of assets related to the closing of a branch location and the sale of the youngman light access manufacturing unit 
during  only million of similar benefits occurred 
lower pension expense in increased operating income by approximately million when compared with the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures had a positive effect on operating income and margins  with the h nnebeck business contributing income during it first full month of operation 
the benefit of positive foreign currency translation in for this segment resulted in increased operating income of million when compared with gas technologies segment dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent gas technologies segment significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues increased demand for cryogenics equipment and industrial cylinders increased demand for composite wrapped cylinders and certain valves decreased sales of propane tanks due to customers accelerating purchases in to avoid price increases other revenues gas technologies segment significant impacts on operating income operating income increased in compared with due mainly to moderating commodity cost increases  particularly steel 
since this segment accounts for the majority of its us inventory using the last in  first out lifo method  this moderation of commodity costs has resulted in improved operating income 
the international businesses  in europe and  to a lesser extent  asia  contributed significantly to the increased performance of the cryogenics business during compared with higher operating income in for composite wrapped cylinders was due to increased shipments of natural gas vehicle ngv cylinders  partially offset by an unfavorable product mix and higher raw material costs for carbon fiber and aluminum 
higher operating income for industrial cylinders was due to increased demand and selling price increases  partially offset by higher energy related and steel costs 
increased costs and an unfavorable product mix in the valves business negatively impacted operating income in compared with a strategic action plan has been implemented to improve the results of the valves business 
this plan is further discussed in the outlook  trends and strategies section 
as expected  the propane business had decreased revenues and operating income in when compared with as indicated last year  there was increased demand for propane tanks in driven by customers accelerating purchases in anticipation of future price increases due to higher steel prices 
foreign currency translation in did not have a material impact on operating income for this segment compared with engineered products and services all other category dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent engineered products and services all other category significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues railway track services and equipment air cooled heat exchangers industrial grating products boiler and process equipment roofing granules and abrasives benefit of positive foreign currency translation revenues engineered products and services all other category significant impacts on operating income higher operating income in including a record third quarter in comparison to for the railway track maintenance services and equipment business was due principally to increased rail equipment sales principally to international customers  international contract services and repair parts sales 
this was partially offset by increased engineering costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  and other expenses related to employee termination benefit costs 
operating income for the air cooled heat exchangers business improved in due to increased volume resulting from an improved natural gas market 
increased operating income for the industrial grating products business was due principally to reduced commodity costs  increased demand partially due to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita  and  to a lesser extent  increased prices and an improved product mix 
the boiler and process equipment business delivered improved results due to improved revenues from the new generation mach boilers 
strong demand for roofing granules and abrasives again resulted in sustained levels of profitable results for that business in  consistent with prior periods 
this is despite difficulty throughout the third and fourth quarters of in obtaining rail cars to deliver its products  and  to a lesser extent  higher energy costs 
the impact of positive foreign currency translation in resulted in decreased operating income of million for this category when compared with outlook  trends and strategies looking to and beyond  the following significant items  trends and strategies are expected to affect the company in comparison with company wide the company will continue its focus on expanding the higher margin industrial services businesses  with a particular emphasis on growing the mill services segment  access services segment and railway services through the provision of additional services to existing customers  new contracts in both mature and emerging markets and strategic acquisitions such as the h nnebeck and bisnh acquisitions in the access services and mill services segments  respectively 
a greater focus on corporate wide expansion into china is expected in and beyond 
the opening of a representative office in beijing in the fourth quarter of has provided a local presence to pursue new business opportunities for all operating units of the company 
the continued growth of the chinese steel industry could impact the company in several ways 
increased steel mill production in china may provide additional service opportunities for the mill services segment 
however  increased chinese steel exports could result in lower steel production in other parts of the world affecting the company s customer base 
additionally  although certain commodity cost increases eg  steel have stabilized in  continued increased chinese economic activity may result in increased commodity costs in the future  which may adversely affect the company s manufacturing businesses 
the potential impact of these risks is currently unknown 
fuel and energy costs increased approximately million in compared with should these costs continue to rise  the company s operating costs would further increase and profitability would decline to the extent that such costs cannot be passed to customers 
foreign currency translation had an overall favorable effect on the company s sales and income during although during the fourth quarter it was negative  but a negative impact on stockholders equity as a result of translation adjustments 
should the us dollar continue to strengthen  particularly in relationship to the euro or british pound sterling  the impact on the company would generally be negative in terms of reduced sales  income and stockholders equity 
the company will continue to focus on improving economic value added eva 
under this program  the company evaluates strategic investments based upon the investment s economic profit 
eva equals after tax operating profits less a charge for the use of the capital employed to create those profits only the service cost portion of defined benefit pension expense is included for eva purposes 
therefore  value is created when a project or initiative produces a return above the cost of capital 
a record million in net cash provided by operating activities has been targeted for controllable cost reductions and continuous process improvement initiatives across the company are targeted to further enhance margins for most businesses 
these initiatives include improved supply chain management  additional outsourcing in the manufacturing businesses  and an added emphasis on corporate wide procurement initiatives 
the company will use its increased size and leverage due to recent acquisitions to reduce vendor costs and focus on additional opportunities for cost reductions via procurement in low cost countries such as china 
total pension expense defined benefit  defined contribution and multi employer for is expected to approximate the level  or be slightly lower 
in the uk  pension expense is expected to decline in due to the significant level approximately million in the past months of voluntary cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plan and the improved performance of the plan s assets 
domestically  the majority of the twenty year amortization of the transition asset from the initial implementation of sfas no 
in will cease during the elimination of this benefit is projected to increase domestic defined benefit pension expense by approximately million when compared with the company s pension committee continues to evaluate alternative strategies to further mitigate overall pension expense including the on going evaluation of investment fund managers performance  the balancing of plan assets and liabilities  the risk assessment of all multi employer pension plans  the possible merger of certain plans  the consideration of incremental cash contributions to certain plans  and other changes that will mitigate future volatility and expense 
changes in worldwide interest rates could have a greater effect on the company s overall interest expense as currently approximately of the company s borrowings are at variable interest rates in comparison to approximately at december  
the company is considering refinancing certain variable interest rate borrowings at longer term fixed rates to reduce potential volatility 
however  this may increase short term interest expense as currently  longer term fixed interest rates are higher than variable shorter term interest rates 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of for certain international earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca  to the us the company completed its evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the ajca and repatriated qualified earnings of approximately million in the fourth quarter of this resulted in the company receiving a one time income tax benefit of approximately million during the fourth quarter of in  the effective income tax rate for continuing operations is expected to approximate 
this compares with an effective income tax rate of in the difference is primarily due to the one time tax benefit from the ajca as indicated above and  consistent with the company s strategic plan of investing for growth  the company designated certain international earnings as permanently reinvested which resulted in a one time income tax benefit of million 
mill services segment to maintain pricing levels  a more disciplined steel industry has been adjusting production levels to bring inventories in line with current demand 
based on current market conditions and industry reports  the company expects global steel production to increase in the increased energy related costs this segment experienced during are expected to persist through however  given the volatility of such costs  the effect cannot be quantified 
the company will be placing significant emphasis on improving operating margins of this segment 
specific plans for include global procurement initiatives  process improvement programs  maintenance best practices programs and executing its reorganization plan 
the bisnh acquisition will provide increased sales and income for this segment 
further consolidation in the global steel industry is also possible 
should transactions occur involving some of the steel industry s larger companies that are customers of the company  it would result in an increase in concentration of credit risk for the company 
if a large customer were to experience financial difficulty  or file for bankruptcy protection  it could adversely impact the company s income  cash flows and asset valuations 
as part of its credit risk management practices  the company is developing strategies to mitigate this increased concentration of credit risk 
access services segment both the international and domestic access services businesses are expected to show continued improvement during in  the youngman light access manufacturing unit was sold and certain large customer projects in the uk and middle east are close to completion  which will eliminate the associated revenue 
in  these decreases are expected to be offset by increased sales and income from the h nnebeck acquisition and through the further development of core activities 
additionally  the sale of the youngman unit will allow for greater focus on the more profitable rental business 
us non residential construction activity continued to improve in and the overall market outlook remains positive 
various industry sources are currently forecasting continued growth for us non residential construction during additionally  new product line additions should assist with growth in north america 
gas technologies segment although cost inflation for steel and certain commodities moderated in  worldwide supply and demand for steel  aluminum and the availability of carbon fiber used to manufacture filament wound composite cylinders could have adverse effects on future raw material costs and this segment s ability to obtain the necessary raw materials 
additionally  the price of brass  a raw material used for certain valves production  continued to increase during  despite expectations that it would moderate 
should brass prices continue to increase in  this could result in reduced operating income for certain products to the extent that such costs cannot be passed along to customers 
weak market conditions and increased costs impacted the valves business during a comprehensive strategic plan was developed and is currently being executed to mitigate these conditions 
the plan includes the following a new senior management team  development and marketing of new products  focus on an expanded international customer base  consolidating certain manufacturing process  process improvements within the manufacturing operations including outsourcing  and optimization of the organizational structure of the business 
if the conditions encountered during persist  despite execution of the strategic action plan  the valuation of this business could be negatively impacted 
despite a decline in  the propane business is expected to improve in  as it returns to its more normal business cycle 
the industrial cylinder and cryogenics equipment businesses are expected to show continued improved performance in engineered products and services all other category international demand for the railway track maintenance services and equipment business products and services has been strong and is expected to remain so in however  on a comparative basis  sales are expected to be less than due to the shipment of several large machine orders in despite this expected decrease in sales  operating income is expected to increase due to increased volume of higher margin industrial services and manufacturing process improvements and efficiencies that are expected to improve margins on a long term basis 
additionally  higher margin international equipment sales will continue to be pursued by this business 
the industrial grating business is expected to sustain its current levels of sales and operating income for it is expected that the incremental business received in  as a result of recent hurricanes  will be replaced with new market opportunities 
although cost inflation for steel and certain commodities started to moderate in  worldwide supply and demand for steel could have an adverse effect on raw material costs and the ability to obtain the necessary raw materials for most businesses in this category 
consistent  sustained profitable results are expected from the roofing granules and abrasives business  although increased energy costs could impact margins 
this business is pursuing the use of more energy efficient equipment to help mitigate the increased energy related costs 
due to an improving natural gas market and additional north american opportunities  demand for air cooled heat exchangers is expected to remain strong for results of operations for  and dollars are in millions  except per share information and percentages revenues from continuing operations cost of services and products sold selling  general and administrative expenses other expenses operating income from continuing operations interest expense income tax expense from continuing operations income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income diluted earnings per common continuing operations diluted earnings per common share effective income tax rate for continuing operations consolidated effective income tax rate comparative analysis of consolidated results revenues vs
