management overview logo general dynamics is a market leader in mission critical information systems and technologies  land and expeditionary combat systems  armaments and munitions  shipbuilding and marine systems  and business aviation 
the company is comprised of four primary business groups information systems and technology  combat systems  marine systems and aerospace and a smaller resources group 
general dynamics primary customers are the us military  other government organizations  the armed forces of allied nations  and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft 
the company operates in two primary markets defense and business aviation 
the majority of the company s revenues derive from contracts with the us military 
the current administration s desire to modernize us military forces coupled with the us military s engagement in the global war on terrorism has driven steady department of defense funding increases since for fiscal year  the congress appropriated billion for the department of defense  a percent increase in funding since this amount includes billion for procurement and research and development r d activities  an increase of percent since procurement and r d budgets  also known as investment accounts  provide the majority of the company s revenues and  over the past several years  these budget lines have enjoyed sustained increases that demonstrate continued administration and congressional support 
for fiscal year  the president has requested that the congress appropriate billion for the department of defense  a percent increase over the funding 
this includes billion for procurement and r d  an increase of percent over investment funds 
in addition  the president s future year defense program fydp anticipates investment funding growing at a nearly percent compound annual growth rate  led by percent compound annual procurement growth 
during this wartime era  defense budgets have evolved to include not only the president s initial budget submission  but also supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year 
for fiscal year  the congress has been asked to provide at least billion in supplemental funding  which  if approved  will bring total defense funding for fiscal year to over billion  an approximately percent increase since approximately percent  or billion  of the supplemental funding request is anticipated for additional investment funding 
looking ahead  the defense budget top line is expected to continue to grow  albeit at a somewhat more moderate rate 
supplemental funding to support ongoing conflicts  in part  is linked to levels of deployed troops and conflict intensity and will likely decrease with a reduction of hostilities 
while this introduces some variability into the overall level of future defense spending  based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets  the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in and the importance of many of the companies programs to the future of the us military was highlighted in the department of defense quadrennial defense review 
this strategic document emphasized some core departmental missions  including pursuing the global war on terrorism  enhancing homeland defense efforts and encouraging the spread of democratic institutions worldwide 
the review highlighted many strategic priorities that are supported by general dynamics products and services  including increasing special operations forces  improving intelligence gathering capabilities  accelerating the production of littoral combat ships and increasing submarine procurement

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition government contracts 
the company accounts for sales and earnings under long term government contracts and programs using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified 
anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts  including g a expenses 
the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg  costs incurred or output eg  units delivered measures  as appropriate to the circumstances 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
business aircraft 
the company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the faa in accordance with statement of position these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
the company records revenue at two points when green aircraft are delivered to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 
pre owned aircraft inventories 
in connection with orders for new aircraft  the company routinely offers customers trade in options 
under these options  if exercised  the company will accept trade in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value 
it is the company s policy to limit its investment in pre owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to  unless specifically authorized 
once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft  the company records pre owned aircraft at the lower of trade in value or estimated net realizable value 
the company treats any excess of the trade in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction 
the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate 
the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information 
these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors  including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
gross margins on sales of pre owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions 
commitments and contingencies 
the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company s exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of the company s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of the company s estimated workers compensation  other insurance related assessments  post retirement benefits and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid  at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government 
the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business  including both existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under the company s contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of the company s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
the company s defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to discount rates used to estimate future liabilities and long term rates of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
the company determines the long term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment  including consideration of both current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
if the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets increased or decreased by basis points  the company s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately in likewise  had the interest rate used to discount the company s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by basis points  the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately in a basis point increase or decrease in either the rate of return on assets or the interest rate used for benefit obligations for the company s post retirement benefit plans would have decreased or increased the post retirement benefit cost by approximately the company s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company s government plans 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
as such  the company s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 
management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations  variable rate commercial paper and short term investments 
as of december   the company had no material short term investments and no outstanding commercial paper 
fixed rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market 
therefore  the company does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk is material for its fixed rate debt 
the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at december   no interest rate swap agreements were in effect 
the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers  long term debt and certain inter company transactions in foreign currencies 
the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments  receipts and inter company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december  and  a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of and pretax  respectively  and an incremental unrealized loss of and pretax  respectively 
this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rates 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  these realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
