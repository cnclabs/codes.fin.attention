item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations performance in compared with performance overview our sales increased to billion in compared to billion in sales increased due to higher selling prices  primarily in our chemicals and coatings segments  and due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation 
the impact of increased volumes in our coatings and glass segments was offset by volume declines in the chemicals segment 
the volume decline in the chemicals segment was due in part to lost sales resulting from the impact of hurricane rita  as discussed below 
gross profit increased million due to higher sales 
the gross profit percentage decreased slightly to for compared to in inflation  including higher raw material costs  primarily in our coatings segment  and higher energy costs in our chemicals and glass segments decreased our gross profit 
the benefits realized from increased selling prices  along with improved manufacturing efficiencies  primarily in our coatings and glass segments  were all factors which increased our gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expense declined slightly as a percentage of sales to despite increasing by million in these costs increased primarily due to increased advertising in our optical products business and higher expenses due to store expansions in our architectural finishes business 
interest expense declined million in  reflecting the year over year reduction in the outstanding debt balance of million 
other charges increased million in primarily due to pretax charges of million related to the marvin legal settlement  net of million in insurance recoveries  million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement  million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes rita and katrina  million for an asset impairment charge in our fine chemicals business  million for debt refinancing costs and an increase of million for environmental remediation costs

results of business segments net sales operating income millions coatings glass chemicals coatings sales increased million or in sales increased due to higher selling prices across all businesses except automotive  due to improved volumes as increases in our aerospace  architectural and original equipment automotive businesses offset volume declines in automotive refinish and industrial coatings  and due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation 
operating income decreased million in the adverse impact of inflation totaled million  of which million was attributable to higher raw material costs 
higher year over year selling prices increased operating earnings by million 
coatings operating earnings were reduced by the million charge for the cost of the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries 
other factors increasing coatings operating income in were the increased sales volumes described above  manufacturing efficiencies  formula cost reductions and higher other income 
glass sales increased million or in sales increased due to improved volumes as increases in our automotive replacement glass  insurance and services and performance glazings flat glass businesses offset volume declines in our fiber glass and automotive original equipment glass businesses 
the positive effects of foreign currency translation were largely offset by lower selling prices primarily in our automotive replacement glass and automotive original equipment businesses 
operating income decreased million in the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement of million  the million impact of rising natural gas costs and the absence of the million gain in from the sale leaseback of precious metal combined to account for a reduction in operating earnings of million 
the remaining year over year increase in glass operating earnings of million resulted primarily from improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs exceeding the adverse impact of other inflation 
our continuing efforts in to position the fiber glass business for future growth in profitability were adversely impacted by the rise in fourth quarter natural gas prices  slightly lower year over year sales  lower equity earnings due to weaker pricing in the asian electronics market  and the absence of the million gain which occurred in stemming from the sale leaseback of precious metals 
despite high energy costs  we expect fiber glass earnings to improve in because of price strengthening in the asian electronics market  which began to occur in the fourth quarter of  increased cost reduction initiatives and the positive impact resulting from the start up of our new joint venture in china 
this joint venture will produce high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products and take advantage of lower labor costs  allowing us to refocus our us production capacity on higher margin direct process products 
the operating earnings of our north american automotive oem glass business declined by million compared with significant structural changes continue to occur in the north american automotive industry  including the loss of us market share by general motors and ford 
this has created a very challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to the domestic oems  including our business 
about half of the decline in earnings resulted from the impact of rising natural gas costs  particularly in the fourth quarter  combined with the traditional adverse impact of year over year sales price reductions producing a decline in earnings that exceeded our successful efforts to reduce manufacturing costs 
the other half of the decline was due to lower sales volumes and mix and higher new program launch costs 
the challenging competitive environment and high energy prices will continue in our business is working in to improve its performance through increased manufacturing efficiencies  structural cost reduction initiatives  focusing on profitable growth opportunities and improving our sales mix 
chemicals sales increased million or in sales increased due to higher selling prices  primarily for chlor alkali products  and due to the combination of an acquisition in our optical products business and the positive effects of foreign currency translation 
total volumes declined as volume increases in optical products were more than offset by volume declines in chlor alkali and fine chemicals 
volume in chlor alkali products and silicas were adversely impacted in the third and fourth quarters by the hurricanes 
operating income increased million in the primary factor increasing operating income was the record high selling prices in chlor alkali 
factors decreasing operating income were higher inflation  including million due to increased energy and ethylene costs  million of direct costs related to the impact of the hurricanes  million due to the asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business  lower sales volumes  higher manufacturing costs and increased environmental expenses 
the increase in chemicals operating earnings occurred primarily through the first eight months of the hurricanes hit in september impacting volumes and costs in september through november and contributing to the rise in natural gas prices which lowered fourth quarter chemicals earnings by million  almost of the full year impact of higher natural gas prices 
the damage caused by hurricane rita resulted in the shutdown of our lake charles  la chemical plant for a total of eight days in september and an additional five

on sept 
  following hurricane rita  ppg declared force majeure for products produced at the lake charles facility 
on oct 
  the facility resumed production at reduced operating rates  and returned to full production capability in mid november 
ppg has recorded a pretax charge in the amount of million in for direct costs primarily related to hurricane damage to the lake charles facility 
this charge is included in other charges in the statement of income under item of this form k 
the company also estimates that pretax earnings were reduced by approximately million in due to lower sales volumes resulting from hurricane rita 
the company is engaged in discussions with its insurance providers and is in the process of evaluating whether these losses will result in insurance recoveries 
market conditions  such as fewer new drug approvals  product withdrawals  excess production capacity and increasing share of generic drugs  have continued to put pressure on the pharmaceutical industry and have created a challenging environment for our fine chemicals business  which is included in our chemicals segment 
these conditions have produced an operating performance in our fine chemicals business in that has been disappointing 
as a result  in the fourth quarter  the company evaluated our fine chemicals business for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  and determined that indicators of impairment were present for certain long lived assets at our manufacturing plant in the united states 
in measuring the fair value of these assets  the company utilized an expected cash flow methodology to determine that the carrying value of these assets exceeded their fair value by million 
we have also decided to sell a small fine chemical facility in france and have written the related assets down to their estimated net realizable value 
due to these developments  the company has recorded an asset impairment charge related to these fine chemicals assets of million pretax  which is included in other charges in the statement of income 
other significant factors the company s pension and other postretirement benefit costs for were million lower than in this decrease represents the impact of market driven growth in pension plan assets that occurred in and an increased benefit provided by the subsidy offered pursuant to the medicare prescription drug  improvement act of the medicare act in  offset in part by a decrease in the discount rate 
the majority of the company s defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation abo basis at dec 
 the underfunded amount increased in  resulting in an increase in the minimum pension liability and a decrease in shareholders equity through a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  aftertax 
this increase in the underfunded amount reflects a reduction of basis points in the discount rate and the impact of a change in the mortality assumption for the us plans used to calculate the abo

in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
among its many provisions  the ajca provided a limited opportunity through to repatriate the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries at a non us tax cost that could be lower than the normal tax cost on such distributions 
during  we repatriated million of dividends under the provisions of ajca resulting in income tax expense of million 
in the absence of ajca  the company estimates the tax cost to repatriate these dividends would have been million higher 
the effective tax rate for was compared to for the the rate is comprised of a tax benefit of on the million charge for the marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries  the million settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case  the million asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business  the million charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the company s obligation related to asbestos litigation under the ppg settlement arrangement  as discussed in note  commitments and contingent liabilities under item of this form k

outlook in  growth in the us economy moderated throughout the year due  in part  to rising interest rates and higher energy  fuel and other raw material costs 
industrial production  which grew at a rate of about in the beginning of the year  slowed in the second half of the year resulting in a full year growth rate of approximately 
industrial production remains the economic metric that most positively correlates with our volume growth because it reflects activity in ppg s broad end use markets 
the commercial construction sector grew at a rate of for the entire year  but showed signs of further improvement during the second half of the year 
housing starts in the us were strong all year 
for the full year  north american production of light vehicles was flat with  while european automotive production was slightly down 
inflation remained at low levels overall and the us equity markets ended the year flat 
the european economy grew in at a rate of just under  but industrial production in europe grew only for the year 
western european light vehicle production was down slightly year over year

table of contents management s discussion and analysis growth in asia was stronger in than in other parts of the world with gdp  industrial production and light vehicle production posting gains in the range of 
entering  most economists predict continued north american growth  but at a slower pace 
once again  inflation is expected to remain relatively low despite historically high energy costs and raw material prices 
this anticipated low level of inflation is due to the impact of increased globalization and productivity 
interest rates are expected to peak this year  with some economists predicting a decline later in the year 
worldwide economic growth is expected to continue in  with all four of the major economies expanding 
the western european economy began to show some positive signs at the end of and that will likely carry forward into early  at low  but positive levels 
growth in eastern europe is expected to continue 
in japan  several economic indicators show that the economic environment has rebounded into positive territory for the first time in several years 
meanwhile  the emerging asian economies are expected to continue to post high growth rates  especially in both china and india 
china s infrastructure growth is expected to continue to impact the overall global economy via increased demand for basic goods and commodities 
additionally  china and other low production cost countries will continue to put downward pressure on worldwide pricing of consumer goods 
as has been our experience the past few years  we expect china s expansion to benefit demand for our coatings  fiber glass and optical businesses  while requiring our glass and commodity chemicals businesses to continue their ongoing focus on reducing costs 
in  we will continue our commitment to our heritage values of serving our customers  introducing new technologies and achieving operational excellence through our continuing focus on reducing costs 
the outlook for the global economic environment should support our efforts to deliver sales growth in throughout our businesses 
we also expect to face continued cost pressures in from pensions  healthcare  natural gas and raw materials 
the cost pressures that we face in mean that we will supplement our ongoing initiatives to lower our manufacturing and overhead costs through continuous improvement with additional actions to reduce our workforce and consolidate facilities 
we are in the process of finalizing our plans and expect to record pretax charges in the first quarter in the range of million to million 
our pension and post retirement benefit costs totaled million in reflecting a decline of million from  however  these costs remain well above their level as a result of subpar investment returns over this time period  particularly the negative investment returns in the equity market in and  a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets  a lower discount rate environment and rising retiree medical costs  particularly for prescription drugs 
based on our current estimates  our pension and other postretirement benefits costs are expected to rise in by million 
all time high natural gas costs in north america were detrimental to our earnings  and these costs rose abruptly following the severe hurricanes that impacted the us gulf coast in the third quarter 
changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments 
each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per million british thermal units mmbtu would have a direct impact of approximately million to million on our annual operating costs 
it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices  which continue to be high and volatile as we begin in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices  we use a number of techniques  which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes  switching to alternative fuels and hedging 
we currently estimate our average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of will be at about per mmbtu  or per mmbtu higher than the first quarter of this represents an increase of over year over year 
beginning in the second half of and continuing throughout  we have experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses  particularly in our coatings businesses 
these increases have resulted from the industrial expansion  supply demand imbalance and increases in supplier costs for oil and other inputs 
year over year coatings raw material costs rose by million in and  while the pace has slowed  we expect to see a further year over year increase in we plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials  reformulating our products  improving our production processes and raising our selling prices 
these same factors  along with high capacity utilization and industry related hurricane outages  resulted in tight supplies of chlor alkali products 
this led to record ecu pricing during all of  with increases recognized throughout the year 
ecu prices in the fourth quarter were up versus the fourth quarter of we expect these market conditions to continue as we enter  but they may moderate at some point during the year 
significant structural changes continue to occur in the north american automotive industry  including the loss of us market share by general motors and ford 
this has created a very challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to this industry 
these oems are also faced with funding substantial pension and post retirement medical liabilities that place stress on their financial condition 
our sales in the us and canada to general motors  ford and the automotive tiered suppliers whose standard poor s credit rating was bb or lower at dec 
 totaled approximately of our total global sales 
these sales were made under normal credit terms and we expect to collect substantially all of the amounts due from these customers at dec

we have been working for the past year on a major business process redesign project in our european coatings business with the objectives of improving our competitiveness  supporting our initiatives to grow the business and increasing our margins 
the project will standardize our business processes throughout the region on a common it application platform in a newly defined business model that includes establishing a new european headquarters in switzerland 
we will reach the first key milestone in this project as we move our european refinish business to the new business model over the first half of the net cost savings in will not be significant but will increase as project activities continue through a sharp focus on our capital spending and working capital has enabled us to continue along our track of strong cash generation  as evidenced by the billion in cash generated from operating activities over the time period 
we have continued to fund our portfolio of businesses and prudently manage capital spending while at the same time continuing our trend of increasing dividend payments to shareholders for consecutive years and reducing our debt by billion over the past five years

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and provides further guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
effective dec 
  ppg adopted the provisions of fin no 
our only conditional asset retirement obligation relates to the possible future abatement of asbestos contained in certain ppg production facilities 
the asbestos in our production facilities arises from the application of normal and customary building practices in the past when the facilities were constructed 
this asbestos is encapsulated in place and  as a result  there is no current legal requirement to abate it 
inasmuch as there is no requirement to abate  we do not have any current plans or an intention to abate and therefore the timing  method and cost of the future abatement  if any  are not known 
in accordance with the provisions of fin no 
 the company has not recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with asbestos abatement  given the uncertainty concerning the timing of future abatement  if any

management anticipates that the resolution of the company s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 
over the past years the pretax charges against income have ranged between million and million per year 
we currently expect that charges against income for environmental remediation in will be within that range  however  it is possible that technological  regulatory and enforcement developments  the results of environmental studies and other factors  particularly as the work at a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in jersey city  nj and at the calcasieu river estuary continues to progress  could alter this expectation and result in higher charges in see note  commitments and contingent liabilities  under item of this form k for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies

impact of inflation in  the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation  including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings segment and higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments  was more than offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our coatings and chemicals segments and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our glass and coatings segments 
in  the combined impact of lower overall selling prices and higher production costs  due to the negative effects of inflation  including the impact of higher raw material and labor costs across all our segments and higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments  was only partially offset through improved manufacturing efficiencies 
in  the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation  including the impact of higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments  was offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments 
we anticipate that the negative impact of inflation on our costs will be less severe in than in  particularly with respect to raw material costs in our coatings segment and energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments 
we expect the combination of continuing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and an overall increase in our selling prices in will enable us to fully recoup the negative impact of inflation  other than natural gas costs 
due to the high volatility of natural gas prices it is difficult to predict the related costs  but if the prices remain at year end levels  we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs

critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item of this form k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and to accounting for pensions  other postretirement benefits  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  environmental remediation  pending  impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for more information on these matters  see note  working capital detail  note  income taxes and note  commitments and contingent liabilities under item of this form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  under item of this form k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments  evaluating market interest rate indices 
ppg annual report and form k 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis and using an outside advisor to determine the yield on a diversified portfolio of available high quality fixed income securities that matches our projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for is for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would increase net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately million and million  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns 
for  the return on plan assets assumption for our us defined benefit pension plans was 
we expect to use the same assumption for a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for each of the three years ended dec 
 was calculated using the gam mortality table  a commonly used mortality table 
in  we will begin to use rp  a newer and more relevant mortality table to calculate net periodic benefit costs for these plans 
we estimate this change in the mortality assumption in will increase net periodic benefit costs by approximately million and million for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  under item of this form k  the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values 
fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows 
based on this testing  none of our goodwill was impaired as of dec 
  however the fair value of our fiber glass business declined during as a result  some or all of the related goodwill of million is at risk in for impairment should our projected recovery in the business not occur 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial  credit  environmental  legal  tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item of this form k related to these contingencies  pensions  other postretirement benefits  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management  although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates
