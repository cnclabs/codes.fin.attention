item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general frontier operates refineries in cheyenne  wyoming and el dorado  kansas as previously discussed in part i  item of this form k 
we focus our marketing efforts in the rocky mountain and plains states regions of the united states 
we purchase crude oil to be refined and market refined petroleum products including various grades of gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  asphalt and other by products 
results of operations to assist in understanding our operating results  please refer to the operating data at the end of this analysis which provides key operating information for our refineries 
refinery operating data is also included in our quarterly reports on form q and on our web site address http www 
frontieroil 
com 
overview our refineries have a total annual average permitted crude capacity of  bpd 
the four significant indicators of our profitability  reflected and defined in the operating data at the end of this analysis  are the gasoline crack spread  the diesel crack spread  the light heavy crude oil differential and the wti wts crude oil differential 
other significant factors that influence our results are refinery utilization  crude oil price trends  asphalt and by product margins and refinery operating expenses including natural gas prices and turnaround  or planned maintenance activity 
we typically do not use derivative instruments to offset price risk on our base level of operating inventories 
under our first in  first out fifo inventory accounting method  crude oil price trends can cause significant fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our crude oil  unfinished products and finished products  thereby resulting in fifo inventory gains when crude oil prices increase and fifo inventory losses when crude oil prices decrease during the reporting period 
see price risk management activities under item a for a discussion of our utilization of futures trading 
during  the price of crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange continued the upward trend  which began during the crude oil price began the year at per barrel  reached a high of per barrel in late august  and ended the year at per barrel 
the crude oil market fundamentals and geopolitical considerations continued to support prices higher than historic averages 
the increase in crude oil prices  along with additional crude oil production being significantly heavy and or sour crude oil  increased our crude oil differentials during the year ended december   when compared to the same period in our gasoline and diesel crack spreads were the highest in our history 
higher demand for gasoline and diesel along with product supply constraints are reasons for our improved gasoline and diesel crack spreads  especially after the damage to gulf coast refineries caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we effected a stock split on june  all prior period share related numbers have been revised to reflect the effect of the split 
compared with overview of results we had net income for the year ended december   of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the same period in our operating income of million for the year ended december   reflected an increase of million from the million operating income for the comparable period in the average diesel crack spread was significantly higher during per barrel than in per barrel 
the average gasoline crack spread was also higher during per barrel than in per barrel  and both the light heavy and wti wts crude oil differentials improved 
specific variances refined product revenues 
refined product revenues increased billion  or  from billion to billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in average product sales prices higher per sales barrel  and higher product sales volumes in  more bpd 
sales prices increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil prices and improvements in the gasoline and diesel crack spreads 
manufactured product yields 
manufactured product yields yields are the volumes of specific materials that are obtained through the distilling of crude oil and the operations of other refinery process units 
yields increased  bpd at the el dorado refinery and  bpd at the cheyenne refinery for the year ended december  as compared to other revenues 
other revenues increased million to a million gain for the year ended december   compared to a million loss for the same period in  the source of which was million in net gains from derivative contracts accounted for using mark to market accounting in the year ended december   compared to net derivative losses of million for the same period in see price risk management activities under item a for a discussion of our utilization of commodity derivative contracts 
raw material  freight and other costs 
raw material  freight and other costs include crude oil and other raw materials used in the refining process  purchased products and blendstocks  freight costs for fob destination sales  as well as the impact of changes in inventory under the fifo inventory accounting method 
raw material  freight and other costs increased by million during the year ended december   from billion in to billion in the increase in raw material  freight and other costs was due to higher average crude prices and higher crude oil charges  reduced by higher fifo inventory gains from rising prices in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we also benefited from improved crude oil differentials during the year ended december  when compared to the same period in for the year ended december   we realized a reduction in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of fifo inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million at the el dorado refinery and million at the cheyenne refinery due to increasing crude oil and refined product prices 
for the year ended december   we realized a reduction in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of fifo inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million for the el dorado refinery and million for the cheyenne refinery because of increasing crude oil and refined product prices 
the cheyenne refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher crude oil prices partially offset by higher fifo inventory gains and an improved light heavy crude oil differential 
the heavy crude oil utilization rate at the cheyenne refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge decreased to in the year ended december  from in as we increased our charges of lighter crude oil to take advantage of market opportunities 
the light heavy crude oil differential for the cheyenne refinery averaged per barrel in the year ended december  compared to per barrel in the same period in the el dorado refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher average crude oil prices partially offset by higher fifo inventory gains and an improved wti wts crude oil differential 
the wti wts crude oil differential increased from an average of per barrel in the year ended december  to per barrel in the same period in refinery operating expenses

the provision reflects an estimated benefit from the american jobs creation act of the act production activities deduction for manufacturers million  offset by the impact of permanent book tax differences from our current estimated statutory tax rate of 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on our deferred tax assets 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or reflecting the net benefit of releasing our deferred tax valuation allowance 
another provision of the act benefited our current income taxes payable for by allowing us an accelerated depreciation deduction of of qualified capital costs incurred to achieve low sulfur diesel fuel requirements 
the act also provides for a per gallon credit on compliant diesel fuel up to an amount equal to the remaining of these qualified capital costs for federal income tax purposes 
see environmental under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared with overview of results we had net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the same period in our operating income of million for the year ended december   represented an increase of million from the million operating income for the comparable period in the average diesel crack spread was significantly higher during per barrel than in per barrel

provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or reflecting the net benefit of releasing our deferred tax valuation allowance offset by the effect of the permanent book versus tax differences and prior year adjustments from our current estimated effective tax rate of the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or due to one time adjustments for permanent book versus tax differences and an increase of  in the income tax provision for the year ended december  resulting from an adjustment to the tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during the year ended december  improved results of operations increased cash flow significantly during  but were partially offset by uses of cash for working capital changes 
working capital changes provided a total of million of cash in the year ended december  while providing million of cash in the comparable period in the uses of cash for working capital during the year ended december   included an increase in inventories of million and an increase in trade and other receivables of million 
the increase in both receivables and inventories was due to the significant increases in crude oil and product prices during the average per barrel cost of inventories in the year ended december   increased by per barrel compared to only a per barrel increase in the comparable period in the most significant working capital item providing cash during the year ended december  was an increase in trade and crude payables of million

future capital expenditures 
compliance with the upcoming ultra low sulfur diesel requirements affecting our refineries will require additional capital expenditures through mid total capital  including capitalized interest  that we will spend to comply with these regulations is currently estimated to be approximately million at the el dorado refinery and million at the cheyenne refinery 
expenditures for the ultra low sulfur diesel projects through december  including and expenditures were million at the el dorado refinery and million at the cheyenne refinery 
the remaining costs for the ultra low sulfur diesel projects at both refineries will be incurred before mid the american jobs creation act of allows us  as a small business refiner  to deduct for federal income tax purposes of the qualified costs related to these low sulfur diesel expenditures in the years incurred and will provide income tax credits based on the resulting production of ultra low sulfur diesel for up to of the remaining qualified costs 
production of ultra low sulfur diesel is expected to begin by mid at our refineries 
capital expenditures aggregating approximately million are currently planned for  and include million at our el dorado refinery  million at our cheyenne refinery  and  for capital expenditures in our denver and houston offices  and for our share of crude oil pipeline projects 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our el dorado refinery includes approximately million for the ultra low sulfur diesel project discussed above  million on the crude unit and vacuum tower expansion  discussed below  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our cheyenne refinery includes approximately million for the ultra low sulfur diesel project discussed above  million on the coker expansion and million on the crude fractionation project  both discussed below  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
our capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by our operations and the utilization of a portion of our existing cash balance  if necessary 
our board of directors  in november  approved three capital improvement projects which are anticipated to be completed between and these projects include a million crude unit and vacuum tower expansion at our el dorado refinery  a million coker expansion and revamp at our cheyenne refinery and an million crude fractionation project at our cheyenne refinery 
the above amounts include estimated capitalized interest 
the crude unit and vacuum tower expansion at the el dorado refinery will allow for higher crude charge rates including a much greater percentage of heavy crude oil and higher gasoline and distillate yields 
this project will likely be implemented in the spring of during the next planned turnaround for the crude vacuum unit complex 
the coker expansion at the cheyenne refinery  which is anticipated to be completed in  will significantly decrease the amount of asphalt produced and increase the amount of higher margin light products such as gasoline and diesel 
the crude fractionation project at the cheyenne refinery will allow us to replace light crude purchases with less expensive heavier crude oil while maintaining gasoline and diesel yields 
we expect to fund these projects with existing cash and internally generated cash flow 
the energy tax incentives act of the act contains provisions that may affect certain of our financial or operational considerations in the coming years 
the act includes a provision that would allow a refiner to expense capital costs associated with expansion of refining capacity  as determined by the manufacture of liquid products other than asphalt and lube oil  in excess of above previously produced volumes 
the act also requires that refiners  importers and blenders ensure that renewable fuel eg  ethanol is blended into the nation s gasoline pool at escalating  prescribed rates beginning with a billion gallon requirement in and increasing to billion gallons in we are currently evaluating the potential consequence that these and other provisions of the act may have on our future operations 
contractual cash obligations the table on the following page lists the contractual cash obligations we have by period 
these items include our long term debt based on their maturity dates  our operating lease commitments  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
our operating leases include building  equipment  aircraft and vehicle leases  which expire from through  as well as an operating sublease for the use of the cogeneration facility at our el dorado refinery 
the non cancelable sublease  entered into in connection with the acquisition of our el dorado refinery in  expires in with an option that allows us to renew the sublease for an additional eight years 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
we have a five year crude oil supply agreement  which began in  with baytex marketing ltd 
baytex  a canadian crude oil producer 
we also have two contracts that obligate us for crude oil pipeline capacity into on the express pipeline from hardisty  alberta to guernsey  wyoming from which we then have pipeline access to take the crude oil to our cheyenne refinery 
we were allowed to assign a portion of our capacity in earlier years for additional capacity in later years with this first contract 
our crude oil supply agreement with baytex includes an assignment of a portion of our pipeline capacity obligation to it 
the amounts shown in the table on the following page for transportation  terminalling and storage contractual obligations are net of million  the approximate cost of the pipeline capacity assigned to other parties for the term of that agreement

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following summary provides information about our critical accounting policies  including identification of those involving critical accounting estimates  and should be read in conjunction with note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which summarizes our significant accounting policies 
turnarounds 
the costs for turnarounds scheduled and required shutdowns of refinery operating units for significant overhaul and refurbishment are ratably accrued over the period from the prior turnaround to the next scheduled turnaround 
since this policy relies on our estimated costs for the next turnaround  adjustments occur as the estimate changes or even when the turnaround is in progress should more or less extensive work be necessary than was anticipated 
these accruals are included in our consolidated balance sheets in the accrued turnaround cost and long term accrued turnaround cost 
the turnaround accrual  any turnaround costs in excess of accrual incurred at the time of turnaround  or reductions of expenses when the actual costs are less than the estimate are included in refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation in our consolidated statements of income 
turnaround costs include contract services  materials and rental equipment 
inventories 
inventories of crude oil  unfinished products and all finished products are recorded at the lower of cost on a fifo basis or market 
crude oil includes both domestic and foreign crude oil volumes at its cost and associated freight and other cost 
unfinished products work in process include any crude oil that has entered into the refining process  and other feedstocks that are not finished as far as refining operations are concerned 
these include unfinished gasoline and diesel  blendstocks and other feedstocks 
finished product inventory includes saleable gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  chemicals  asphalt and other finished products 
unfinished and finished products inventory values have components of raw material  the associated raw material freight and other costs  and direct refinery operating expense allocated when refining begins relative to their proportionate market values 
the fifo method of accounting for inventories sometimes results in our recognizing substantial gains in periods of rising prices or losses in periods of falling prices from our inventories of crude oil and products 
while we believe that this accounting method more accurately reflects the results of our operations  since many other refining companies instead utilize the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories  a comparison of our results to other refineries must take into account the impact of the inventory accounting differences 
asset retirement obligations 
we account for asset retirement obligations as required under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
 accounting for retirement asset obligations 
fas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement costs being capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset

refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
since the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional  fin provides that a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset obligation should be recognized if that fair value can be reasonably estimated  even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under fas no 
we adopted fin as of december  for which we recorded a net asset retirement obligation of million  recognized million in as the pretax cumulative effect of an accounting change million after tax and recorded a million increase in property  plant and equipment 
in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions  including  among other things  projected cash flows  a credit adjusted risk free interest rate  and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
these estimates and assumptions are very subjective  however  we believe that we have adequately accrued for our asset retirement obligations at this time and that changes in estimates in future periods would not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
environmental expenditures 
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized based upon their future economic benefit 
costs that improve a property s pre existing condition  and costs that prevent future environmental contamination  are capitalized 
remediation costs related to environmental damage resulting from operating activities subsequent to acquisition are expensed 
liabilities for these expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
such estimates are subject to change due to many factors  including the identification of new sites requiring remediation  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation  additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts  and potential improvements in remediation technologies 
pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
we have significant pension and post retirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control 
these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these plans and the current assumptions used 
new accounting pronouncements see new accounting pronouncements in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
no new pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
market risks see the item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements under price risk management activities for a discussion of our various price risk management activities 
when we make the decision to manage our price exposure  our objective is generally to avoid losses from negative price changes  realizing we will not obtain the benefit of positive price changes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk impact of changing prices 
our revenues and cash flows  as well as estimates of future cash flows  are sensitive to changes in energy prices 
major shifts in the cost of crude oil  the prices of refined products and the cost of natural gas can generate large changes in the operating margin from refining operations 
these prices also determine the carrying value of our refineries inventories 
price risk management activities 
at times  we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions  purchases of foreign crude oil and consumption of natural gas in the refining process or to fix margins on certain future production 
gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of income as raw material  freight and other costs or refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation when the associated transactions are consummated  while gains and losses on transactions accounted for using mark to market accounting are reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income at each period end
