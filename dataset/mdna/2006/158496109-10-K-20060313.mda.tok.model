 we performed a test for retail and manufacturing goodwill impairment using the income approach 
under this method  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
in applying this present value method  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 
in applying the income approach  we assumed a cash flow period of five years  a discount rate of and a terminal value of five times the present value of the fifth year s estimated future cash flows 
the results of this impairment test indicated that retail goodwill had no value  resulting in a non cash  pretax impairment charge equal to the remaining balance of retail goodwill of million  which was recorded in the quarter ended september  interest expense interest expense decreased by million in versus interest on senior notes decreased by million due to our purchase and retirement of million of senior notes in and million in interest on senior notes also decreased because fiscal consisted of weeks versus weeks for fiscal retail floor plan interest expense is included in discontinued operations in while a portion is included in interest expense for continuing operations in income taxes during and  we provided a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets

upon default by a retailer under a floor plan financing agreement subject to an associated repurchase agreement  the repurchase agreement generally requires the manufacturer to repurchase the loan or the home for the unpaid balance of the floor plan loan  subject to certain adjustments 
in the event of such repurchases  our loss is equal to the difference between the repurchase price and the net price we realize upon resale of the home  less any accrued volume rebates that will not be paid 
each quarter we review our contingent wholesale repurchase obligations to assess the adequacy of the reserve for repurchase losses 
this analysis is based on a review of current and historical experience  reports received from the primary national floor plan lenders that provide floor plan financing for approximately of our manufacturing sales  and information regarding the performance of our retailers obtained from our manufacturing facilities 
we do not have repurchase risk for cash sales and we do not always enter into repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders that provide financing for the balance of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers 
the estimated repurchase obligation is calculated as the total amount that would be paid upon the default of all of our independent retailers whose inventories are subject to repurchase agreements  without reduction for the resale value of the repurchased homes 
as of december   our largest independent retailer  a nationwide retailer  had approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase for up to months from date of invoice

strategies considered to improve our capital structure include without limitation  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging  or otherwise retiring our outstanding indebtedness  restructuring of obligations  new financings  and issuances of securities  whether in the open market or by other means and to the extent permitted by our existing financing arrangements 
we evaluate all potential transactions in light of existing and expected market conditions 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
on february   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire united kingdom based calsafe group holdings ltd 
and its operating subsidiary caledonian building systems  a leading modular manufacturer  for approximately million 
the transaction will be financed through a combination of debt  via an approximate million sterling denominated increase in our credit facility  and cash 
a portion of the purchase price will be earned upon the achievement of certain financial benchmarks over the next four years 
the transaction is expected to close in early april  we expect to spend less than million in on capital expenditures 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near term 
we may use a portion of our cash balances and or incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions of businesses 
contingent liabilities and obligations we had significant contingent liabilities and obligations at december   including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling million and guarantees by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries of million of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
additionally  we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
we estimate our contingent repurchase obligation as of december  was approximately million  without reduction for the resale value of the homes 
see contingent repurchase obligations discussed above in item of this report 
we have provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of our business  in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements 
we are also subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent liabilities and obligations will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
summary of liquidity and capital resources at december   our unrestricted cash balances totaled million and we had unused availability of million under our revolving credit facility 
therefore  total cash available from these sources was approximately million 
we expect that our cash flow from operations for the next two years will be adequate to fund capital expenditures during that period as well as the approximately million of scheduled debt payments due in and we expect to use cash of approximately million in early april  in connection with our acquisition of calsafe group holdings ltd 
therefore  the level of cash availability is projected to be substantially in excess of cash needed to operate our businesses for the next two years 
we may use a portion of our cash balances and or incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions of businesses 
in the event that our operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would revise our operating strategies accordingly 
contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of payments due by period for our contractual obligations for long term debt  capital leases  operating leases  and certain other long term liabilities as of december  payments due by period after december  within after total year to years to years years in thousands long term debt senior notes due senior secured term loan due obligations under industrial revenue bonds other capital leases and debt operating leases total the maturity date for each of the term loan  the revolving line of credit and the letter of credit facility is october   unless as of february   more than million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due are outstanding  then the maturity date will be february  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax assets  and property  plant and equipment 
historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves  including reserves for self insured risks  warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses 
following is a description of each accounting policy requiring significant judgments and estimates reserves for self insured risks we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  general and products liability  auto liability  health and property insurance 
under our current self insurance programs  we are generally responsible for up to  per claim for workers compensation  per claim in california and automobile liability claims  up to million  million or million per claim for product liability and general liability claims  depending on the policy year under which the claim is made  and up to million per claim for property insurance claims including business interruption losses 
we maintain excess liability and property insurance with independent insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
under our current self insurance program we are responsible for up to  of health insurance claims per contract per year 
estimated casualty and health insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors considered in estimating our insurance reserves are the nature of outstanding claims including the severity of the claims  estimated costs to settle existing claims  loss history and inflation  as well as estimates provided by our outside insurance broker and carrier  and third party actuaries 
significant changes in the factors described above could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
warranty reserves our manufacturing operations generally provide the retail homebuyer with a twelve month warranty 
estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale 
our warranty reserve is based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing operations as of the balance sheet date 
factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty  including homes in retailer inventories and homes purchased by consumers still within the twelve month warranty period  and the historical average costs incurred to service a home 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
property  plant and equipment the recoverability of property  plant and equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  primarily based on estimated selling prices  appraised values or projected undiscounted cash flows 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy and operating conditions 
additionally  we use estimates of fair market values to establish impairment reserves for permanently closed facilities that are held for sale 
past evaluations of property  plant and equipment have resulted in significant impairment charges primarily for closed manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers including charges in the fourth quarter of significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the requirements established in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recording of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we incurred significant pretax losses in through during through the manufactured housing industry and we were challenged by limited availability of consumer and floor plan financing  high industry consumer repossession levels and an uncertain economic outlook  resulting in a continued decline in manufacturing shipments and retail sales 
after consideration of these factors  we provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in deferred tax assets will continue to require a valuation allowance until we have demonstrated their realizability through sustained profitability and or from other factors 
the valuation allowance will be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized as a reduction of taxes otherwise payable on any future earnings or a portion or all of the valuation allowance is otherwise no longer required 
the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities pertaining to tax deductible goodwill are determined on an aggregate basis versus an acquisition by acquisition basis 
when future tax deductions result in a net deferred tax liability for tax deductible goodwill  in the absence of the reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  this deferred tax liability will be established through a deferred tax provision 
during and  we had us pretax income totaling approximately million for financial reporting purposes and expect to be profitable in depending on the level of our us pretax income in and expectation of future profitability  it is possible that all of the then remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be reversed to income during or goodwill remaining goodwill is related to our manufacturing operations 
we test for goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate the fair value of our manufacturing segment versus its carrying value as of each fiscal year end or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
when estimating fair value  we calculate the present value of future cash flows based on forecasted sales volumes  the number of homebuilding facilities in operation  current industry and economic conditions  historical results and inflation 
past evaluations of goodwill have resulted in significant impairment charges for retail segment goodwill including charges in significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or differences between estimates and actual results could result in impairment charges in the future 
wholesale repurchase reserves the majority of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with the providers of floor plan financing 
potential losses under repurchase obligations are determined by calculating the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes  less accrued rebates which will not be paid 
probable losses under repurchase agreements are accrued based on the historical number of homes repurchased  the cost of such repurchases and the historical losses incurred  as well as the current inventory levels held at our independent retailers 
in addition  we monitor the risks associated with our independent retailers and consider these risks in our evaluation of the wholesale repurchase reserves 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our operations during the last three years 
commodity prices  including lumber  fluctuate  however  during periods of rising commodity prices we have generally been able to pass the increased costs to our customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt obligations under the credit agreement are subject to variable rates of interest based on libor 
a basis point increase in the underlying interest rate would result in an additional annual interest cost of approximately million  assuming average related debt of million  which was the amount of outstanding borrowings at december  our obligations under industrial revenue bonds are subject to variable rates of interest based on short term tax exempt rate indices 
a basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  assuming average related debt of million  which was the amount of outstanding borrowings at december
