overview headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana inc is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health benefits companies  based on our revenues of billion 
we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internet based plans for employer groups  government sponsored programs  and individuals 
as of december   we had approximately million members in our medical insurance programs  as well as approximately million members in our specialty products programs 
we manage our business with two segments government and commercial 
the government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs  and includes three lines of business medicare advantage  tricare  and medicaid 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals  and includes three lines of business fully insured medical  aso  and specialty 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of sfas  which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business 
the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing  benefits and underwriting requirements 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other income  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks  enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
we believe our customer  membership  revenue and pretax income diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success 
our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium  aso fee  and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs 
medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new higher priced technologies 
table of contents and medical procedures  increasing capacity and supply of medical services  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking  the tort liability system  and government regulations 
government segment in our government segment  the passage of the mma in december demonstrated the federal government s commitment to providing health benefits and options to seniors by creating new product choices for medicare eligible individuals sold through the private sector 
these new products include pffs plans and local ppos  with coverage effective in  and regional ppos and pdps  with coverage effective in the pffs plans generally offer additional benefits compared to traditional medicare in exchange for a monthly premium paid by the member 
these plans typically include a prescription drug benefit with no provider network restrictions 
local and regional ppo plans typically offer an even higher level of benefits to members  including a prescription drug benefit and a lower level of member cost sharing on many benefits when the member uses medical services from in network providers 
as a long time participant in the medicare program  we believe that we possess business competencies and management experience with senior product design  a robust and scalable multi channel distribution system  an established and competitive network including a national retail pharmacy network  and an established brand awareness with seniors 
accordingly  we have developed a strategy to take full advantage of these expanded programs 
this resulted in significant expenditures and commitments of resources during  including  among other items increasing the number of markets where we sell our products  designing products that offer a compelling combination of price and benefits to capture market share  raising brand awareness with the launching of our let s talk education campaign  as well as substantial marketing and advertising increases  expanding the distribution network  including partnering with wal mart stores  inc and increasing our captive sales force  increasing the size and scope of our provider network  and adding employees to accommodate membership growth  including opening a dedicated medicare service center in tampa bay  florida 
our strategy and commitment to these expanded medicare advantage programs has led to substantial growth during medicare advantage membership increased to  members at december   up from  members at december   primarily due to sales of our new pffs products and the addition of  members from our acquisition of careplus health plans of florida in february likewise  medicare premium revenues have increased to billion for from billion in we expect the medicare line of business to continue to grow during from continued geographic expansions of our medicare advantage offerings and our new pdp plans 
as of february   medicare advantage membership totaled more than  members and pdp membership totaled approximately million members 
we expect medicare premium revenues to more than double from from sales of our medicare advantage and pdp plans and for selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in however  while our creation of the infrastructure related to our medicare expansion will be nearly completed by the end of the first quarter of  we do not believe the resulting expected revenues and membership will peak until medicare enrollment is completed on july  we believe this will result in lower earnings and margins in the first half of relative to the second half of  when we believe our consolidated revenues will reach the level contemplated by our selling  general  and administrative expenses 

table of contents in our tricare business  marked our first full fiscal year under the south region contract 
after being awarded the south region contract in  we transitioned our tricare business to one of three newly created regions under the government s revised tricare program during we started the second option year under the south region contract on april  commercial segment our strategy to drive commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of a variety of innovative and consumer choice product designs 
these products are supported by electronic informational capabilities  including education  tools  and technologies provided primarily through the internet 
to that end  we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as smart products 
we believe that these smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of quickly rising health care costs for their employees 
membership in our smart products and other consumer choice health plans increased to  members at december   a increase from december  we believe that growth in these products  which are offered both on a fully insured and aso basis and competitively priced to produce higher margins  is a key component  among other items  for further improvement in the results of our commercial segment 
additionally  we have increased the diversification of our commercial membership base  not only through our consumer choice products  but also by expanding our aso membership in the mid market group segment to take advantage of our network discounts and launching our humanaone individual product to address an increasing migration of insureds from small group 
while we expect our consumer choice products to become a driver of growth in the years ahead as health care inflation persists  we also are enhancing the traditional products which comprise the bulk of our commercial portfolio today by applying our consumer choice innovation 
other important factors which impact our commercial segment profitability are both the competitive pricing environment and market conditions 
with respect to pricing  there is a tradeoff between sustaining or increasing underwriting margins versus increasing or decreasing enrollment 
we have experienced a decline in our fully insured commercial membership as a result of pricing actions by some competitors who we perceive as desiring to gain market share in certain markets 
with respect to market conditions  we are impacted by economies of scale on administrative overhead 
as a result of a decline in preference for tightly managed hmo products  medical costs have become increasingly comparable among our larger competitors 
product design and consumer involvement have become more important drivers of medical services consumption  and administrative expense efficiency is becoming a more significant driver of commercial margin sustainability 
consequently  we continually evaluate our administrative expense structure and realize administrative expense savings through productivity gains 
additionally  because our commercial segment shares overhead costs with our government segment  an increase or decrease in the size of our government operations impacts our commercial segment profitability 
highlights in the government segment  cms approved all the medicare contracts we applied for  giving us a wide array of products to sell and increasing the number of states where we sell them 
our commercial segment reached an agreement to acquire cha service company and completed the acquisition of corphealth  inc our government segment completed the acquisition of careplus health plans of florida 
these transactions are more fully described on the following page and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in
