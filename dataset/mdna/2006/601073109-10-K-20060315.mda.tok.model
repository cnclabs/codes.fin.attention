item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of millipore corporation 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
basis of presentation throughout this item  references will be made to constant currencies 
constant currency is a non gaap measure whereby foreign currency balances are translated  for all periods presented  at millipore s predetermined budgeted exchange rates for  thus excluding the impact of fluctuations in the actual foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition to analyzing us gaap financial results  we also analyze our results in constant currencies as we believe these measures may allow for a better understanding of the underlying business trends 
general overview we are a leading provider of consumable and hardware products and services that improve productivity in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and in clinical  analytical and research laboratories 
we are organized into two operating divisions bioprocess  which represents approximately of our business  and bioscience  which represents approximately of our business 
our bioprocess division helps our customers to optimize their manufacturing productivity and to scale up the production of therapeutic drugs  including difficult to manufacture biologics 
we assist drug production during both pre clinical development and manufacturing scale up after drug approval 
our bioscience division helps to optimize laboratory productivity and workflows 
both divisions provide consumables  hardware and services 
in bioprocess  we offer solutions in the following categories process filtration and chromatography  process monitoring tools  systems and components  and services 
in bioscience  we offer sample preparation products  as well as laboratory water solutions and services 
in bioprocess  we derived the highest percentage of our revenues from process filtration and chromatography consumable products in these products enable companies to separate the desired components from the undesired components in a fluid stream or to isolate the molecules that are the basis of their drugs 
our process monitoring tools allow customers to measure the levels of microbial contamination in their drugs in order to verify their quality and purity 
we support commercial scale drug production for customers through processing systems and components 
these systems and components are needed to effectively purify and produce complex biologics and other drugs in large quantities 
our bioprocess services offerings include conducting biological testing  process validation testing and related consulting services for customers 
in bioscience  we provide our laboratory customers with systems for producing ultrapure water  which is essentially free of contaminants and is needed to conduct a variety of experiments in the laboratory 
these laboratory water systems save our customers time and money by making high purity water easily accessible by many scientists 
in addition to purifying water  laboratory scientists must work with sterile solutions and are increasingly involved in conducting dna and protein research  which begins with the ability to extract and concentrate specific molecules for analysis 
our laboratory sample preparation products aid in these efforts as well as in the accurate and consistent analysis of sample molecules 
our bioscience services are primarily focused on the maintenance of our laboratory water systems 
revenue growth during  revenue growth was both in us dollars and in constant currencies  of which acquisitions contributed 
this compares to revenue growth in of in us dollars and in constant currencies 
we expect our revenue growth in constant currencies to be to

table of contents business drivers the market drivers of our bioprocess division include increasing demand and production volumes of marketed therapeutics and an accelerating number of approvals for new biologics 
in particular  a higher number of approvals for monoclonal antibodies  recombinant vaccines and other recombinant protein based therapeutics are driving the market 
monoclonal antibodies  which are separation intensive  complex to produce  and require significant use of our bioprocess solutions  are being approved at faster rates and are being produced in larger volumes due to increasing demand and their ability to treat intractable diseases 
the growth in biologics is creating an increase in demand for our consumable products that enable the production of therapeutic drugs 
we provide a number of technologies that can be used in small scale production of a drug and reliably scale up to commercial size manufacturing volumes 
as a result  we expect our revenue related to a specific drug will increase over the various stages of the drug approval process  in particular  as the drug moves into later stage clinical trials and ultimately into commercial production 
the quarterly revenues in our bioprocess division can vary significantly  particularly due to fluctuations associated with our business related to biologics 
additionally  new initiatives by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to improve their manufacturing productivity have also increased the demand for millipore s products and services 
in the us  the food and drug administration s process analytical technologies initiative is affecting how our customers measure and characterize their production processes  which is creating demand for faster and more frequent testing utilizing our products 
the market drivers of our bioscience division include global expansion of laboratories and the corresponding products used by scientists in these laboratories to conduct drug development and protein research 
new pressures on global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to improve research and development productivity and identify new drug candidates has led to increasing demand for our products that increase laboratory productivity 
the market is also being driven by an increasing focus on virus research due to public health concerns and research precipitated by bioterrorism defense efforts 
the growth in clinical tests worldwide due to an aging population and improvements in clinical diagnostics technology is increasing the demand for consumable products used in these tests 
strategy in june  we announced a new strategy designed to capitalize on our strong brand and market position and to support our plans for growth over the next five years 
as part of this new strategy  we are seeking to expand our products and services  build new technological capabilities and leverage acquisitions and collaborations 
in order to meet these objectives  we have established the following strategic priorities continue to strengthen our leadership position with our biopharmaceutical manufacturing customers  become a strategic supplier to bioscience research markets  lead our industry in product quality and manufacturing effectiveness  and bring new talent into the organization 
during  we began to execute against this strategy  acquiring two companies  novaseptic ab novaseptic and microsafe bv microsafe  and forming a collaboration with gen probe incorporated gen probe for next generation process monitoring tools 
we also continued to execute a significant global supply chain initiative designed to improve our product quality and manufacturing effectiveness and have targeted a significant improvement in our gross margins by 
table of contents highlights in january  martin d 
madaus joined the company as president and chief executive officer 
dr 
madaus was appointed millipore s chairman in march we combined our former laboratory water and life science divisions into a new bioscience division  resulting in our two current operating divisions 
we restructured the executive management team  with of our top executives being new  or in new or expanded positions since january  in july  we expanded the scope of our global supply chain initiative in an effort to improve our profitability over the next four years 
this included announcing our efforts to significantly reduce the number of our worldwide manufacturing facilities by as part of this effort  we are consolidating our worldwide bioprocess systems hardware manufacturing operations in and closing our puerto rico facility in we are also implementing improvements to our procurement and manufacturing processes 
in july  we began the expansion of our bioprocess services offerings through the acquisition of microsafe 
microsafe develops assays and provides testing services from its netherlands laboratories to help biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers monitor quality and compliance in the drug manufacturing process 
microsafe enhances our bioprocess services offering to european customers and enables us to participate in the outsourcing trend of the biotechnology industry 
in august  we broadened our offering of innovative bioprocess solutions through the acquisition of novaseptic 
novaseptic provides products for aseptic processing applications in biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and expands our bioprocess division s process monitoring tools and systems and components businesses 
in august  we entered into an alliance with gen probe to develop  manufacture and commercialize innovative nucleic acid testing products for rapid microbiological and virus monitoring in biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes 
these products  the first of which we expect to market in  are intended to improve the speed and accuracy of current testing methods used in the industry 
in december  we strengthened our financial flexibility by establishing a new million revolving credit facility 
during  we launched new products from across both of our divisions and for a variety of applications  including our direct q water purification system  lynx disposable manufacturing connectors  millistak pod clarification filters  viresolve prefilter capsule filters  integritest integrity testing instrument  millipore express pes shr cartridges and capsules  several new ranges of filter housings for biopharmaceutical and beverage markets  acerta liquid filling system  immobilon fl membranes and immobilon western hrp and ap chemiluminescent substrates for western blotting applications 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our critical accounting policies had a significant impact on the preparation of these financial statements 
these policies include estimates and significant judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates require us to make the most difficult judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when evidence of an arrangement is in place  related prices are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred contractual obligations have been satisfied and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations remain  such as customer site acceptance testing after products are delivered  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided 
for laboratory water systems  installation and maintenance service revenues are recognized when the site service visit is completed 
for validation and sample testing services provided to customers  revenue is recognized when the contracted study is completed and accepted by the customer 
revenue for fixed price contracts associated with our large  custom process equipment business is recognized under the percentage of completion method poc 
over the past three years  approximately of our revenues have been derived from poc sales 
revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared with the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent completed is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that assumptions used in calculating poc during the construction of the process equipment are later revised  total revenue and expenses estimated for contracts upon completion could differ from the latter estimate 
if it is estimated that the project will result in a loss when completed  the entire loss is recognized at that point 
actual results related to poc estimates have been materially the same as the assumptions used at the beginning of each contract 
in addition  should a poc contract be cancelled while in progress  we would generally be able to recover expenses incurred with progress payments previously received during the design and construction period 
typically  such progress payments can range between and of the total contract sales value 
historically  we have experienced few cancellations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
allowances for doubtful accounts are provided when collection becomes unlikely 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  we reserve an amount believed to be uncollectible 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of gross receivables 
during the past three years  we have provided between million per year for allowances for doubtful accounts  which approximates bad debt write offs during those years 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation analysis 
our product life cycle is generally a minimum of years and may be in excess of years 
therefore  given the stable demand for our products  we generally rely upon recent historic usage and estimated future demand in estimating the realizable value of our inventory 
finished goods and components that are determined to be obsolete are written off when such determination is made 
in certain cases  for newly introduced products and overstocked products  estimated future demand is considered in establishing inventory write downs 
raw material and work in process inventories are also reviewed for obsolescence and alternative or future use based on reviewing manufacturing plans  estimated future demand and market conditions 
in situations where it is determined that work in process inventories cannot be converted into finished goods  the inventories are written down to net realizable value 
inventory at december  reflects cumulative net realizable value write downs of million 
should it be determined that write downs are insufficient  we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross margin 
once recorded  inventory valuation provisions are not subsequently reversed 
valuation of long lived assets 
valuation of certain long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  requires significant judgment 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill that require that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized 

table of contents we utilize third party valuation experts to assist us in this process 
changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 
for intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant changes or developments in strategy or operations which affect our intellectual or tangible properties 
should we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows  including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 
we perform annual reviews for impairment of goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill may be considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
during the second quarter of  we conducted an impairment review of our million of goodwill at that time and concluded that it was not impaired 
in the third quarter of  we completed two acquisitions in our bioprocess reporting unit which increased our goodwill balance to million as of december  if the fair value of our bioprocess reporting unit were substantially reduced  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
income tax provision 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our statement of income  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
our valuation allowance is provided to reserve against the expiration of state research credit carryforwards  state investment credit carryforwards  state net operating loss carryforwards and other state deferred tax assets 
at december   we had million of state research credit and net operating loss carryforwards and other state deferred tax assets  all of which are fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
at december   projections of future taxable income show that all remaining federal general business credits gbc will be utilized 
as a result  we released the remaining federal valuation allowance of million 
at december   we had gbc carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through we are a worldwide business 
due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our business operations  we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis 
significant judgment is required in 
table of contents determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
we periodically assess our exposures related to our provision for income taxes and appropriately accrue taxes for contingencies that may result in potential tax obligations 
we believe the reserves are necessary to adequately reflect tax obligations which may arise out of current and future audits 
any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us as we repatriated approximately million of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of in december  there were no cumulative earnings outside the us upon which us income taxes had not been provided as of december  despite the one time repatriation election  we expect future earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries will be considered indefinitely invested outside of the us employee pension and postretirement medical plans 
in the us  we sponsor a pension plan and a postretirement medical plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
for both plans  we determine several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
for the pension plan  these key assumptions include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and rate of future compensation increases 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we considered the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan 
this included considering the trusts asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
the assumed discount rate approximates the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled 
we used moody s aa corporate bonds rate index as the benchmark rate for estimating our discount rate for pension expense 
as of december   we adopted the citigroup pension liability index yield curve to determine our discount rate for calculating the projected benefit obligation because it has been developed specifically for pension plan liabilities and is increasingly accepted as the more appropriate index than other bond indices 
in addition  our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience  such as withdrawal and mortality assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by us in future years 
during  we recognized our pension expense using a discount rate of  an expected return on plan assets of and a rate of future compensation increases of related to our us pension plan 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our us pension plan are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
although they are the most sensitive assumptions  a basis point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations 
for the postretirement medical plan  key assumptions include the discount rate and the future medical cost escalation rate 
our actuarial consultants also employ other assumptions for future experience  such as withdrawal and mortality 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from future actual results due to changing conditions in the growth of medical expenses or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of postretirement medical expense recorded by us 
during  we used a discount rate of and an expected medical cost escalation rate that declines gradually from in to in although they are the most sensitive assumptions  a basis point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations 
in certain foreign subsidiaries  we also sponsor pension plans for our employees 
accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of country specific assumptions for discount rates  expected returns on assets and rates of compensation increases 
we apply a consistent methodology  year over year  in determining the key assumptions which  in addition to future experience assumptions such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates  are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and expenses for each of these plans 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our foreign pension plans are the discount rate and 
table of contents the expected rate of return on plan assets 
although they are the most sensitive assumptions  a basis point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations 
intent to refinance short term debt as long term debt 
our new credit agreement allows for revolving loan borrowings of up to million 
borrowings against our new credit agreement of million million were outstanding at december  and have been classified as long term because of our intent and ability to continuously refinance such borrowings 
if our intent changes  it could result in a significant amount of debt being recharacterized as short term debt in future financial statements

consumables sales increased in the division experienced strong demand for chromatography media and other consumable filtration devices by customers for use in the production of monoclonal antibody and recombinant protein therapeutics as well as for vaccines 
hardware sales increased primarily due to the acquisition of novaseptic during the third quarter 
services  which represent a small percentage of bioprocess division sales  grew due to our strategic microsafe acquisition in the third quarter of during  sales increased in constant currencies as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher demand for chromatography media and process scale filtration devices as well as increased manufacturing campaigns of marketed biotechnology drugs  and start up and validation of new customer production lines and their processes 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in hardware sales 
hardware sales are impacted by customer decisions to add or modify their production capacity and are  therefore  cyclical in nature which may result in significant variability in period to period sales growth comparisons 
bioscience division in the bioscience division  constant currency sales grew during as compared with strong demand for consumable products used in laboratory water purification  drug discovery and other general 
table of contents filtration applications was partially offset by declining sales of products used in oem devices and genomics applications by life science laboratories 
in addition  services provided to customers for water purification equipment grew as the installed base of equipment continued to grow 
during  sales increased in constant currencies as compared to throughout  we saw an increase in drug discovery and drug development spending by pharmaceutical companies especially in the united states and certain european countries 
modest sales improvements to customers in europe was due to a slowly improving european economy and increased laboratory activities by customers within environmental  public health  clinical and university sectors 
the asia pacific region also was favorably impacted due to improved economic conditions  partially offset by the impact from a change in japanese government policies which delayed the utilization of otherwise available research grants by government and university laboratories

further  our customers increased their spending for drug discovery projects  thereby supporting the demand for our consumables offerings 
in europe  the constant currency sales growth was primarily due to chromatography and filtration consumables 
our novaseptic and microsafe acquisitions positively impacted sales growth in both the americas and europe 
the growth in the asia pacific region was modest 
during as compared to  revenue growth was the same in both actual us dollars and constant currencies as a result of a mix of currency movements during the year 
a stronger us dollar negatively impacts 
table of contents us dollar sales growth because approximately of our sales are outside the us since we have a higher percentage of our sales in europe than in asia  the impact of translating sales denominated in european currencies will have a greater impact on our us dollar sales than the impact of translating sales denominated in asian currencies 
in  the americas achieved constant currency sales growth of driven by strong sales of process and laboratory scale consumables 
sales benefited from the improving economic environment  improved capital markets for life science and biotech start ups  and increased spending on drug discovery research 
the modest increase in sales to customers in europe was due to a slowly improving european economy and increased laboratory activities by customers within environmental  public health  clinical and university sectors 
the increase in sales within the asia pacific region was due to improved economic conditions  partially offset by the impact from a change in japanese government policies which delayed the utilization of otherwise available research grants by government and university laboratories 
during  the us dollar  with respect to foreign currencies  was weaker on average as compared to prior year levels 
a weaker us dollar would positively impact us dollar sales growth 
the impact of translating foreign currency sales to the us dollar improved the reported sales growth rate by approximately

hardware sales increased primarily due to the novaseptic acquisition during the third quarter of the growth in services is primarily the result of the microsafe acquisition in the third quarter of and services provided to customers for water purification equipment as our installed base of such equipment continued to grow 
sales of our consumables grew in as compared with primarily due to the sales of chromatography media and filtration devices used in drug manufacturing 
the decline in hardware sales in as compared to 
table of contents was predominantly driven by two factors 
in  we adopted a more selective set of sales criteria which focused on those hardware orders with higher profitability or orders where the customer indicated intent to purchase our consumables and services 
in addition  capital purchases made by our customers are generally used for construction of their manufacturing capacity and thus can vary significantly period to period based on their product demand or new drug processes 
the growth in the sales of services in was due to continued demand for maintenance of our installed base of laboratory water filtration systems as well as increased marketing of validation support services to our biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers 
gross margin gross margin percentages were in  in and in the decrease in our gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to million costs recorded in connection with our global supply chain initiatives  which included million for severance  million for accelerated depreciation and million for inventory write downs 
in addition  our gross margin was negatively impacted by the sale of products acquired in connection with the novaseptic acquisition as the value of the acquired inventories were written up to fair value under the purchase accounting rules 
these were offset by improvements in production costs as a result of improved execution in our global supply chain as well as higher overall production volume in movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our gross margin in during  we will continue to incur similar costs for the global supply chain initiatives  but we also expect to see some improvements in our gross margin from these projects as compared to the gross margin in the decrease in our gross margin in as compared with was primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  which increased the average cost of products manufactured in our european plants 
had exchange rates in been similar to rates  gross margin would have been approximately flat year to year 
in addition  plant start up and product validation spending for the new membrane manufacturing facility  which was completed in  as well as increased incentive compensation expense in offset the higher net realizable value write downs of inventory and other costs in operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million or as compared to included in our sg a expenses were million executive transition costs and million severance related to our divisional consolidation as compared to million in ceo transition costs recorded in the executive transition costs included costs associated with the ceo transition and other executive termination agreements 
higher sg a expenses in also included million higher incentive compensation and salaries as a result of improved operating results and increases in our overall employee headcount 
in addition  we incurred higher professional fees in as a result of various corporate initiatives  including repatriation of foreign earnings  development of corporate strategy  recruiting costs  sales training and demolition costs for our bedford campus 
operating expenses from our novaseptic and microsafe acquisitions also accounted for million of the increase in our sg a expenses 
the demolition costs for our bedford campus are for site preparation for our new research and development facility which will be completed in in  sg a expenses increased million or as compared with the increase in was primarily due to a million increase resulting from the us dollar weakening against the euro and the yen  million in ceo transition costs  a million write off of intangibles and fixed assets related to the discontinuation of a research and development project  and a million increase in incentive compensation 
in the fourth quarter of  following a research and development project review  we determined that the safepass sterile transfer technology  acquired in  would not achieve our new product profitability and cash flow criteria 
accordingly  we terminated the project and wrote off the million intangible asset and million of related fixed assets 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development r d expenses increased million or in as compared to included in r d expenses were a million increase in incentive compensation and salaries  million expenses from our new acquisitions  and million severance related to the consolidation of our laboratory water and life science operating segments 
in  r d expenses increased million or from included in spending was a million increase in incentive compensation 
purchased intangibles amortization purchased intangibles amortization increased million or in as compared to primarily due to amortization expenses associated with intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions 
purchased in process research and development in  we wrote off million of purchased in process r d costs in connection with our novaseptic acquisition 
this represents the fair value of r d projects that were still in development stage prior to reaching technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative future use 
two projects related to novaseptic disposable products were identified as in process r d projects 
these projects  which were approximately complete at the date of acquisition  were expected to be completed in with an estimated additional spending of approximately million  primarily related to labor costs 
the estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were discounted to the present value using a discount rate of 
restructuring and other in  we completed the restructuring program 
upon completion of this restructuring program and final cash disbursements in the second quarter of  we reversed million for previously estimated lease and severance payments  as these amounts were no longer required 
we also recognized a million benefit for assets that had been previously written off 
also in  we received proceeds of million and realized a gain of million in connection with a sale of real estate 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased million in as compared with and decreased million in as compared with the decreases in net interest expense in and were a result of decreased amount of average debt outstanding as well as increased cash balances due to strong operating cash flows 
during the first half of  we repaid million of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
in december  we borrowed million under a new revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the incremental net interest expense from this borrowing was negligible because we borrowed the funds at the end of and invested the cash received in various short term commercial papers and other marketable securities 
the decrease in net interest expense from to was primarily due to our million repayment of a note payable in march and the additional million repayment on borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
we expect to generate net interest income in provision for income taxes our effective tax rates on net income for  and were  and  respectively 
these tax rates represent a blended tax rate primarily as a result of profits across different tax jurisdictions and specific items such as taxes on repatriated foreign earnings and changes in valuation allowances and reserves 
the higher tax rate in as compared to was primarily a result of million of tax obligations related to the repatriation of foreign earnings  partially offset by the release of million tax valuation 
table of contents allowance 
based upon projections of future income and the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings in  general business credits previously expected to expire unutilized are now projected to be used to reduce future taxes 
the remainder of the increase in our effective tax rate is the result of geographic distribution of our profits 
we expect our effective tax rate for to be approximately to as compared to the rate in the tax rate is impacted by the geographic distribution of our profits 
in addition  our tax rate may be impacted by our stock plan activities when we adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
the higher tax rate in as compared to was primarily a result of the reversal in of a tax valuation allowance  partially offset by an increase in tax reserves as well as the geographic distribution of profits 
during the fourth quarter of  we capitalized certain historical r d costs for tax returns on a retroactive basis  thereby utilizing net operating losses 
because of this capitalization and other tax planning strategies relating to the use of foreign tax credits  the million valuation allowance related to the foreign tax credits was released 
also in the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded additional tax reserves of million related to exposures previously mitigated by the reserved foreign tax credits 
the net impact of this activity resulted in a million tax benefit 
market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as credit risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in revenues  net income and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our primary risk management strategy uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the periods of these forward contracts typically span less than three months 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at december  the fair value of these contracts was a gain of million at december  in december  we entered into certain forward contracts to hedge our net investment in a european subsidiary before we repatriated accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of we recorded a gain of million in our other comprehensive income in december as a result of this net investment hedge 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact our business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and financing activities  which include debt as well as cash and cash equivalent and other highly liquid marketable securities 

table of contents our debt portfolio is comprised of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings 
our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our revolving credit facility 
we assess our interest rate risks on a regular basis but do not currently use financial instruments to mitigate these risks because there is a natural offset between our cash and debt portfolios subject to variable interest rate movements 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our income statement as of december  credit risk we are exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade receivables 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings

we believe that our dso will continue at about the current level 
inventory increased million 
the increase is due to planned inventory build up in connection with our manufacturing plant consolidation program as well as the addition of novaseptic inventories 
in  we benefited from improvements in our manufacturing and supply chain management programs put in place during the second half of that are aimed at better matching of materials purchased to production cycles and product demand 
days of supply in inventory decreased by days from days at december  to days at december  accounts payable increased million

accrued expenses increased million in approximately million of the increase was due to various employee compensation accruals related to improved business performance 
in addition  at december   approximately million was accrued for severance costs related to the departure of the former chairman of the board  ceo and president of millipore 
cash outflows from investing activities were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the cash flow generated from operations during was used for business acquisitions  purchases of property  plant and equipment  and repayment of debt 
in  we acquired novaseptic and microsafe for million  net of cash acquired  and purchased million of property  plant and equipment as compared to million of property  plant and equipment purchased in the and additions were driven principally by our continued need to expand our existing facilities in ireland and france to accommodate the migration of certain manufacturing activities as part of our strategic manufacturing consolidation initiative 
our largest projects for included the construction of our new research and development center in bedford  massachusetts and the buildout of a new membrane production line in cork  ireland 
the and additions were driven principally by our continued need to upgrade and add manufacturing capacity 
in  we completed the construction of our state of the art filtration membrane manufacturing facility in jaffrey  new hampshire and substantially completed our new administrative facility in france 
we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to invest in capital projects and to fund future acquisitions 
during  we expect to spend in the range of to million on capital additions  excluding business acquisitions 
previously  we had invested a total of million of a planned million project at the december  actual rate of exchange to expand manufacturing capacity in a facility adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in ireland 
in  we delayed the completion of this project as we believed that existing manufacturing capacity could meet our projected demand for the next few years 
the current demand expectation  however  indicates that this facility needs to be in operation in accordingly  in  we approved the completion of this project and the construction will be resumed in we had cash inflow from financing activities of million in in and  we had net cash outflows of million and million  respectively 
in  cash inflow from financing activities was driven by million borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and million of cash proceeds received from exercises of employee stock options  offset by the repayment of million borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility during the first half of during  we repaid the million note payable that became due in march and repaid million of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
these were offset by the cash proceeds of million received from employee stock option exercises in during  we repaid million of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility and received million from exercises of employee stock options 
we entered into a new five year unsecured revolving credit agreement in december and terminated our prior five year unsecured revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in the new credit agreement provides for a domestic revolving credit facility and a foreign revolving credit facility  each with a maximum borrowing of million 
the combined borrowings at any one time under both domestic and foreign revolving credit facilities may not exceed in the aggregate 
we may elect to increase the credit facilities by an amount up to million during the term of the new credit agreement 
we may choose an interest rate equal to either libor plus an applicable margin as provided for in the new credit agreement or a base rate  defined as the higher of the annual rate of the lead bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate  plus for borrowings under the new credit agreement 
weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the new credit agreement was for the new credit agreement also calls for a commitment fee at an annual rate ranging from to  based on our credit rating  on unused commitments 
our prior credit agreement allowed for revolving loan borrowings of up to million 
the terms for interest rates on individual borrowings were established for periods not to exceed twelve months 
the weighted 
table of contents average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the prior credit agreement was during the prior credit agreement also called for a facility fee at a rate ranging from to of the committed available funds under the facility 
the exact amount of the margin and the facility fee under both credit agreements is dependent on our debt rating 
during the fourth quarter of  a leading debt rating agency upgraded our rating 
in the first quarter of  another leading agency reaffirmed their rating with a positive outlook 
in february  our debt rating was upgraded again by a leading rating agency 
higher debt ratings help reduce our cost of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
in addition  higher debt ratings may allow us easier access to the capital market 
because of our intent and ability to continuously refinance our borrowings under our revolving credit agreements  such borrowings have been classified as long term liabilities as of december  and december  we maintain various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for the benefit of our employees 
at december   our us pension plan and postretirement benefit plans were under funded by million and million  respectively 
we anticipate funding for these plans will be approximately million in at december   our international retirement plans were under funded by million 
we anticipate funding for these plans will be approximately million in our future pension expense and pension liabilities will be affected by fluctuations in future discount rates as well as the fair market value of assets used to fund these plans 
we believe that our cash and highly liquid investments in marketable securities  our ready access to capital markets for competitively priced instruments  and cash flows expected to be generated from future operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months as well as cash requirements to fund future acquisitions
