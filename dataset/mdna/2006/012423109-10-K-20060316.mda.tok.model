overview we are a global chemistry based drug discovery and development company  focused on identifying and developing novel biologically active small molecules with applications in the prescription drug market 
we engage in comprehensive chemistry research from lead discovery  optimization and development to commercial manufacturing and conduct cell and non cell based high throughput screening on a variety of biological targets 
we perform chemistry research for many of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and for our own internal research and development 
in addition to our chemistry contract services  we also conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds to third parties in return for up front service fees and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
in  our proprietary research and development activities led to the development  patenting and licensing of a substantially pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  the active ingredient in the non sedating antihistamine fexofenadine hcl marketed by sanofi aventis sa as allegra in the americas and as telfast elsewhere 
in october  we licensed the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize potential products from our amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors identified in one of our proprietary research programs to bms 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our chemistry contract service business and million revenue from our royalties on sales of allegra 
during we performed work for more than customers  including new customers 
we generated million in cash from operations and spent million in capital on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to the construction and outfitting of research facilities in singapore and india and the expansion of our manufacturing suites at our rensselaer facility 
in addition  we paid down million in outstanding principal on our credit facilties 
we recorded net income of million in as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in bank and other related debt  carrying a blended interest rate of approximately 
strategy we continue to execute a long term strategy to grow our global platform chemistry services business while leveraging our proprietary technologies and capabilities to provide greater value to our customers and further growth for the company 
in  we established operations in singapore and india  enabling us to provide our chemistry research and development services in lower cost environments 
in february  we completed the acquisition of comgenex  a privately held drug discovery service company in budapest  hungary 
we expect the addition of comgenex to provide the company with significantly increased access to the european market  as well as another lower cost environment from which we can provide our services 
we have designed our operating structure and our services to provide our customers with opportunities to reduce overall drug development time and cost and to simultaneously pursue a greater number of drug discovery and development opportunities across a wide range of technologies  geographic locations  and cost structures 
the ongoing trend of sourcing contracted chemistry services to lower cost providers resulted in several of our domestic competitors exiting or significantly reducing their presence in the marketplace during the year 
we believe that we are positioned to fill the void left by these providers  enabling us to further increase our market share 
we also continued to expand our clinical supply manufacturing capabilities at our large scale manufacturing facility  enabling us to seamlessly transition our customers clinical supply manufacturing projects through the drug discovery and development process from the development of these materials at our smaller scale chemistry laboratories to large scale production for use in advanced stage human trials 
clinical supply manufacturing supplements our rensselaer facility s legacy services  which include large scale cgmp commercial production  as well as high potency and controlled drug substance manufacturing 
in addition  clinical supply manufacturing presents additional commercial production opportunities  as we seek to enter into comprehensive agreements with our customers that also provide for commercial supply of these materials upon meeting regulatory approval 
clinical supply manufacturing represented of our large scale manufacturing revenue  compared to in our largest customer  ge healthcare formerly amersham plc ge  discontinued purchases of one of the products that we sold to them in sales of this product totaled million in  which represented of large scale manufacturing revenue and of total contract revenue for the year ended december  our objective is to recoup the revenues associated with this sales decrease through increased sales of another product to ge  as well as continued growth in clinical supply manufacturing 
we will continue to seek opportunities to add services and technologies that add value to our customers 
we are also evaluating opportunities to leverage our large scale cgmp production facilities  including identifying niche products to manufacture such as active pharmaceutical ingredients api for use in generic versions of compounds whose patents have expired or will be expiring  as well as assessing complementary lines of business that support cgmp production 
we continue to advance our proprietary technologies and programs with the goal to generate licensing and other revenue opportunities 
in  we licensed the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize potential products from our most advanced proprietary research program  involving amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors  to bms 
in conjunction with the licensing agreement  we received a non refundable  non creditable up front fee of million 
in addition  the agreement provides for bms funding of company research scientists to further advance the program over a period of three years  as well milestone and royalty payments for the achievement of certain events and commercial sales of compounds derived from the program 
we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies to further advance other early to middle stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  immunosuppresion and inflammation  with a view to seeking a licensing partner for these programs at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
additionally  we continue to seek comprehensive chemistry research and supply agreements with our customers that incorporate several of our service offerings and span across the entire pharmaceutical research and development process  including access to our chemical compound and natural product libraries  performance of screening and other lead discovery activities  performance of lead optimization and pre clinical testing  and large scale manufacturing for clinical trials and commercial sale if the product meets regulatory approval 
under these comprehensive agreements  companies typically receive a combination of fees for performance and delivery of goods and services  as well as milestone and royalty payments should collaborative efforts lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
we are currently in the process of implementing a company wide enterprise resource planning erp system  which will ultimately result in the management of all components of our business across all locations within one integrated operating system 
we expect the erp to provide increased visibility into the operation and management of our contract chemistry service and research and development businesses 
in addition  we expect to realize efficiencies through the consolidated processing of our administrative functions in a uniform manner across all locations 
the business environment for chemistry outsourcing continued to evolve in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries that comprise our customer base showed indications of returning to growth  and the increase in demand for our developmental and small scale cgmp manufacturing services that we experienced in the second half of continued through  reflecting a reduction in budgetary constraints and renewed efforts to bring identified compounds into clinical trials 
pricing for our services remained extremely competitive  and the trend of sourcing contracted chemistry services to lower cost providers continued 
we commenced lower cost international operations in singapore and india in april and july  respectively 
our ability to provide services under a variety of business models and cost structures was well received by our customers  resulting in an increase in demand for our discovery services both internationally and domestically during the latter portion of  ending a two year period of declining demand for these services 
we expect the trend of increased demand for our services to continue in the competitive environment facing allegra also remained challenging during the past year 
as discussed in item of this form k  several generic manufacturers have filed anda applications with the fda seeking authorization to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us patents 
on september   barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
announced that they had entered into an agreement for the launch of fexofenadine hydrochloride mg  mg and mg tablets  the generic version of allegra tablets in the united states 
the launch of the generic product is considered an at risk launch due to the on going litigation 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra by sanofi aventis in the fourth quarter of and in turn  the royalties earned by us on those sales 
on september   we and aventis pharmaceuticals filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the us district court in new jersey seeking to enjoin barr pharmaceuticals  inc  teva pharmaceuticals ltd  ranbaxy laboratories  ltd 
and amino chemicals  ltd 
from the sale of generic versions of allegra in the united states 
our motion was denied on january  we continue to forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra 
we have filed an appeal of the ruling in the preliminary injunction matter  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as the patent infringement litigation progresses 
however  should we or aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would continue to experience a material decrease in royalty revenues and operating cash flows 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine announced by barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
on september  had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a year over year decrease in our royalty revenues for the fourth quarter 
we currently expect that the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine will have a similar impact on our royalty revenues in future periods 
we expect to experience a decrease in revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows in the short term as we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
library inventory write off in  we recorded a reserve of million to reduce the carrying value of our library inventories to reflect less favorable market conditions than previously projected by management and an excess quantity and carrying value of inventory on hand compared to projected future sales revenue 
we continued to monitor the carrying value of our remaining natural product and chemical lead finding sample collections for impairment throughout as previously disclosed  if we were unable to meet forecasted revenues related to those assets or if actual market conditions were less favorable than those projected  we might be required to write down all or a portion of the remaining value of certain compound library assets 
in connection with our ongoing monitoring of the valuation of our library assets for the quarter ended december   we determined that an unfavorable shift in the market for compound libraries had occurred  and we were unable to forecast any meaningful demand for our chemical lead finding sample collections 
as a result  we recorded a final reserve increase of million to eliminate the remaining carrying value of these collections 
results of operations effective january   we began consolidating our financial results with organichem corporation 
for the period january  through february   our consolidated financial results reflect a ownership of organichem 
effective february   the date of our purchase of the remaining ownership of organichem  our financial results reflect ownership of organichem 
as a result  our revenues and operating expenses in   and include the results for organichem 
operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the discovery development small scale manufacturing dds and large scale manufacturing lsm segments based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information we receive from this internal system 
the dds segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale manufacturing 
the lsm segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing  all of which are in compliance with the food and drug administration s fda current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for each of our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in s dds lsm total dds contract revenue for was million  an increase of compared to contract revenue of million in the increase in contract revenue was due to an increase in demand for development and small scale manufacturing services  as our customers increased their efforts to further develop previously identified compounds and bring them into clinical trials 
the increase in development and small scale manufacturing revenue was partially offset by a decrease in discovery services revenues  as the industry trends of reduced spending and sourcing of these services to lower cost international providers continued in however  upon commencing lower cost international operations in singapore and india  our ability to offer our services under a variety of business models and cost structures was well received by our customers  resulting in an increase in demand for our discovery services both internationally and domestically during the latter portion of in addition  the license and research agreement that we signed with bms in october includes a significant contract research component and also results in the recognition of an million up front payment over a three year research term 
these factors contributed to an year over year increase in discovery services revenue in the fourth quarter of we expect the growth trends in both discovery services and development and small scale manufacturing services to continue in lsm contract revenue increased by million  or  to million in compared to in the increase in contract revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for clinical supply products for advanced stage human trials as we shift the focus of our large scale manufacturing operations 
clinical supply manufacturing revenues were million in  or of total lsm revenue  compared to million in  or of total lsm revenue 
our largest lsm customer  ge  discontinued purchases of one of the products that we sell to them in sales of this product totaled million  which represented of lsm revenue  and of total contract revenue for the year ended december  we expect a modest decrease in large scale contract revenue in  as the decrease in revenue resulting from discontinued sales of this product to ge are expected to be largely offset by increased sales of another product to ge  as well as continued growth in the area of clinical supply manufacturing for advanced stage human trials 
dds contract revenue for was million  a decrease of compared to contract revenue of million in the reduction in our contract services was attributable to reduced spending by our customers due to a weak economic environment  leading to budgetary pressures within the pharmaceutical and biotech industries 
additionally  an increase in foreign competition operating with lower cost structures impacted certain areas of our business during lsm contract revenue declined by million  or  to million in compared to the decline was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from its second largest customer due to the timing of delivery requirements from this customer  partially offset by an increase in demand for clinical supply manufacturing for advanced stage human trials 
recurring royalties we earned royalties under our licensing agreement with sanofi aventis sa for the active ingredient in allegra telfast 
royalties were as follows year ended december  in s recurring royalties decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to the fourth quarter impact of the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine by barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
for the nine months ended september   recurring royalties were million  an increase of million or from million for the nine months ended september   due to higher year to date worldwide sales of allegra  as well as higher royalty payments in certain countries 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine announced by barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
on september  had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra in the fourth quarter of recurring royalties for the three months ended december  were million  a decrease of million or from million for the three months ended december  the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine announced by barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
on september  had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a year over year decrease in our royalty revenues for the fourth quarter 
we currently expect that the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine will have a similar impact on our royalty revenues in future periods 
we expect to experience a decrease in revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows in the short term as we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
on september   we and aventis pharmaceuticals filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the us district court in new jersey seeking to enjoin barr pharmaceuticals  inc  teva pharmaceuticals ltd  ranbaxy laboratories  ltd 
and amino chemicals  ltd 
from the sale of generic versions of allegra in the united states 
our motion was denied on january  we continue to forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra 
we have filed an appeal of the ruling in the preliminary injunction matter  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as the patent infringement litigation progresses 
however  should we or aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would continue to experience a material decrease in royalty revenues 
furthermore  the entrance of additional generic competitors upon the expiration of barr s day exclusivity period for marketing generic fexonfenadine or an at risk launch of a generic version of allegra d by a generic competitor could result in further decreases in royalty revenues 
recurring royalties for the year ended december  decreased to million  compared to million for the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales of allegra telfast by sanofi aventis  due to over the counter competition from allegra s primary competitor  claritin 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue  from which we derive gross profit from contract revenue  consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees  chemicals  depreciation and other indirect costs 
cost of contract revenue for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in s dds lsm total dds gross margin lsm gross margin total gross margin dds contract revenue gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to in the increase in gross margin largely resulted from the increase in contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of dds contract business  a decrease in compensation and benefits expense of million due to a reduction in scientific personnel  a decrease in facilities and overhead costs of million due to the reallocation of these costs to more appropriately reflect the cost of operating our laboratory and administrative facilties  as well as decreases in write downs of our library and raw material inventories from million and million  respectively in  to million and million  respectively in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in library amortization expense of million 
we expect dds contract revenue gross margin to improve in due to increases in contract revenues both domestically and internationally  a reduction in inventory charges  and the elimination of library amortization expense due to the write down of the underlying assets 
these increases are expected to be partially offset by the recognition of additional stock based compensation in lsm contract revenue gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in the decline in gross margin is due to the transition of our large scale manufacturing facility from specializing in the manufacturing of commercial products to the manufacturing of clinical supply compounds for use in human trials 
we expect gross margins to increase slightly or remain flat in as we continue to implement process management improvements and cost savings initiatives in an effort to maximize the efficiency and profitability of our clinical supply manufacturing operations 
dds contract revenue margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the decrease in dds contract revenue margin was due to write downs of our library and raw material inventories  as well as the decline in contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of dds contract business 
lsm contract revenue margin decreased to in from in due to the decline in production and sales volume in relation to the fixed cost components of lsm contract business 
technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan designed to stimulate and encourage novel technology development by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor 
under our technology development incentive plan  thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  receives payments as the sole inventor of the patents for fexofenadine hcl equal to of the total payments received by us with respect to those patents 
the incentive award was as follows year ended december  in s the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the decrease was directly attributable to the decrease in allegra royalties in we expect technology incentive award expense to fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the decrease was directly attributable to the decrease in allegra royalties in compared to research and development research and development expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel  costs of chemicals and other out of pocket costs and overhead costs for work performed on proprietary technology research and development projects 
we utilize our expertise in small molecule chemistry  biocatalysis and natural products to perform our internal research and development projects 
the goal of these programs is to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  research and development is performed at our rensselaer  ny facility related to the improvement of production processes as well as research related to the potential manufacture of new products 
research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in s research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in research and development expenses is due to the fact that research and development expenses for the year ended december  include a million charge related to the issuance of warrants to bms in conjunction with our acquisition of intellectual property related to our central nervous system cns programs 
the decrease is also due to the fact that we licensed our cns programs  which represented our most significant investment in r d in both and  to bms in october as a result  after signing the agreement in october  we did not incur significant r d expenditures that would have been necessary to further advance these programs 
in addition  certain costs associated with these programs  primarily consisting of compensation and benefit costs related to the amri scientific personnel working on these programs  have shifted to cost of contract revenue related to the contract research we are performing for bms in conjunction with the licensing and research agreement 
finally  the decrease is also due to initiatives we undertook to reorganize our internal departments in order to have a more formalized and structured r d business group in  resulting in a more narrow focus of the scope of our research and development activities 
research and development expenses are expected to decrease in due to the elimination of costs associated with our advanced stage cns programs 
research and development expenses in are expected to be related to the evaluation and continued advancement of our early to middle stage internal research programs 
projecting expected project completion dates and anticipated revenue from our internal research programs is not practical at this time due to the early stages of the projects and the inherent risks related to the development of new drugs 
our internal central nervous system program was our most advanced project to date  which we licensed to bms in exchange for up front license fees  contracted research services  and the rights to future milestone and royalty payments 
we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies to further advance other early to middle stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  immunosuppresion and inflammation  with a view to seeking a licensing partner for these programs at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development expenses is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not available 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase is primarily attributable to million in expenses recorded for the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock to bristol myers squibb bms in the first quarter of the warrants were issued in conjunction with an agreement whereby bms transferred intellectual property related to preclinical drug candidates and patent applications covering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and central nervous system applications to the company 
these warrants were cancelled in october in conjunction with the licensing of our cns programs to bms 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the design  research  and testing of the company s semi exclusive libraries 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing  operational and administrative employees  professional services  marketing costs and costs related to facilities and information services 
selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows year ended december  in s the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is due to an increase in salary and benefit expenses of million resulting from the addition of administrative and business development personnel  as well as the reallocation of certain personnel expenses to more appropriately reflect the current use of these resources  the addition of million in start up and administrative costs associated with our singapore and india operations  and a million increase in facilities costs associated with the reallocation of these costs to more appropriately reflect the current cost of operating our laboratory and administrative facilities 
these increases are partially offset by million of employee and equipment relocation costs associated with the closure of our mount prospect facility incurred during  as well as a decrease in professional fees of million due to an overall decrease in sarbanes oxley compliance service costs and additional accounting and valuation service fees associated with the impairment analyses performed at our bothell and mount prospect facilities in selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in due to increased administrative personnel costs  the recognition of additional stock based compensation costs  additional travel costs associated with our international operations  and additional recruiting costs associated with the staffing of scientific personnel at both our domestic and international operations resulting from the anticipated increased demand for our contract services 
these increases are expected to be partially offset by a decrease in professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to professional fees related to our sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and other accounting and valuation services of million  and million in employee and equipment relocation costs associated with the closure of the mount prospect facility 
these increases were partially offset by the elimination of million in abandonment costs associated with the relocation of our iowa operations in impairment and restructuring charges as of june  we completed an in depth review of the carrying value of all of our natural product and chemical compound library inventories 
as a result of this review  which was based on expected future revenues  it was determined that a significant write down in the carrying value of library inventories was required 
the reduction in the carrying value of the library inventories reflected less favorable market conditions than previously projected 
the write down of library inventories triggered an assessment of the recoverability of certain other related long lived assets and goodwill within the bothell reporting unit  including the goodwill and intangibles which resulted from the acquisition of new chemical entities nce  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

based on our review  we determined that an impairment of certain related goodwill and long lived assets had occurred 
in addition  we initiated a restructuring which resulted in the closure of our mt 
prospect research center and the consolidation of mt 
prospect s operations in our new york facilities 
the restructuring triggered an assessment of the carrying value of the mt 
prospect research center property and equipment and related goodwill 
based on this review  and in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we determined that an impairment of certain related goodwill and property and equipment had occurred 
further  we incurred restructuring costs related to the mt 
prospect restructuring 
the restructuring costs are included under the caption restructuring charge in the consolidated statements of operations and the restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets at december  and the following table displays the restructuring activity and liability balances balance at january  adjustments payments balance at december  in s termination benefits asset disposal costs total costs of termination benefits related to severance packages  outplacement services and career counseling for employees affected by the restructuring 
asset disposal costs relate primarily to brokerage commissions  legal fees  and marketing expenses associated with the planned sale of the mount prospect research center facility  which is included in property and equipment held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company also incurred million in employee and equipment relocation costs during these relocation costs are included under the caption selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statement of operations 
we are currently marketing the mt 
prospect research center facility for sale 
the facility qualified for held for sale treatment in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of the long lived assets associated with mt 
prospect have been segregated to a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheet until they are sold and depreciation expense has ceased respective to those assets 
we anticipate the completion of the sale of the facility by june the above restructuring activity was recorded exclusively in the dds operating segment 
the net cash outflow related to the restructuring for the year ended december  was million 
anticipated cash outflows related to the restructuring for are million  which primarily consists of the payment of accrued asset disposal costs 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates represented the company s proportionate share in the income or loss of investees that the company accounts for under the equity method 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates was as follows year ended december  in s the decrease in loss to million for the year ended december  from million for is attributed to the company s share of net losses in an equity method investee 
the loss recorded in reduced the value of the company s investment to  and as such  no further adjustments will be recorded until the investee returns to a position of positive net worth 
the decrease in income of million or to million for the year ended december  from million for is attributed to our acquisition of the remaining stock of organichem in  which increased our ownership percentage to at february  from at december   resulting in the full consolidation of organichem s financial results reduced by a minority interest share representing the previous owners share of net income from january  through february  in the loss recorded in represented the company s share of the net loss in a separate equity method investee 
interest expense year ended december  in s interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was due to increases in the rates paid on the company s variable rate debt that were not hedged by its interest rate swaps  partially offset by the paydown of the million outstanding balance on the company s line of credit in the third quarter of interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to the capitalization of interest costs incurred during the construction of the company s headquarters facility in interest income year ended december  in s interest income increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in interest income was primarily due to increases in the rates earned on short term cash equivalents and investment securities  as well as an effort by management to maximize balances held in short term cash equivalent accounts  which are higher yielding than interest bearing cash accounts 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in our rate of return as higher yielding securities matured and were replaced with securities yielding the lower rates reflected in the market conditions at that time 
the company also earned lower rates on its interest bearing cash accounts and other short term cash equivalents in due to the downturn in the interest rate environment 
loss on equity investment we have equity investments in leveraged private companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
during  we made equity investments in two private companies totaling million 
under the terms of these agreements  we provided fte services to each customer in exchange for equity securities  plus additional fee for service cash payments 
we assess the fair value of these investments quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of  one of our investees attempted to raise additional financing in order to fund its operations  but was unable to secure such financing on acceptable terms 
as such  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our investment based on an analysis of the investee s current financial condition  its prospects of generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this analysis it was our judgment that an other than temporary impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was zero  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
we determined that no impairment was required for our remaining  equity investment based on our analysis as of december  however  should the events and conditions that are indicative of impairment as noted above arise  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
income tax expense year ended december  in s income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the overall increase in income tax expense is attributable to an increase in income before income tax expense  even though income tax expense for reflects the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges as non deductible tax items 
the fluctuation in the effective rate results primarily from the impact the revised projected annual results had in relationship to the projected annual permanent differences 
our effective tax rate is consistent with the company s historical experience excluding the impact of the impairment charges 
we expect the effective tax rate to approximate of pre tax income for income tax expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for income tax expense in reflects the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges as non deductible tax items 
excluding the impact of these items on pre tax income  the decrease in the effective tax rate from is due to the increased impact of permanent tax deductible items in relation to decreased pre tax income in liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
during  we generated cash of million from operating activities 
the primary sources of operating cash flows were payments received for the performance of contracted chemistry services  royalty payments received from sanofi aventis based upon a percentage of sales of allegra  and an up front licensing fee from bms in conjunction with the signing of a license and research agreement 
the primary uses of operating cash flows are the payment of compensation and benefits to both scientific and administrative personnel  purchases of inventory and supplies  and payment of occupancy costs 
the company s net income of million includes several significant non cash costs including depreciation and amortization of million and impairments of library inventories of million 
these non cash costs are partially offset by the recognition of million of deferred tax benefit  which is a non cash income item 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our operating cash flows 
as discussed in item of this form k  several generic manufacturers have filed anda applications with the fda seeking authorization to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us patents 
on september   barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
announced that they had entered into an agreement for the launch of fexofenadine hydrochloride mg  mg and mg tablets  the generic version of allegra tablets in the united states 
the launch of the generic product is considered an at risk launch due to the on going litigation 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra by sanofi aventis in the fourth quarter of and in turn  the royalties earned by us on those sales 
on september   we and aventis pharmaceuticals filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the us district court in new jersey seeking to enjoin barr pharmaceuticals  inc  teva pharmaceuticals ltd  ranbaxy laboratories  ltd 
and amino chemicals  ltd 
from the sale of generic versions of allegra in the united states 
our motion was denied on january  we continue to forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra 
we have filed an appeal of the ruling in the preliminary injunction matter  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as the patent infringement litigation progresses 
however  should we or aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would continue to experience a material decrease in royalty revenues and operating cash flows 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  primarily resulting from million for the acquisition of property and equipment  and purchases of investment securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities of these securities of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting of million in long term debt repayments  offset by million provided by proceeds from stock option and stock purchase plan exercises 
working capital was million as of december   compared to million at december  the decrease of million resulted from a million increase in income taxes payable due to the timing of income tax payments and the generation of additional taxable income in in addition  there was a decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  which primarily resulted from the pay down of outstanding balances on our line of credit of million and capital expenditures of million 
these decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations of million  which includes the receipt of an million up front license fee from bms in conjunction with a license and research agreement signed in october the up front fee was included in deferred revenue and will be recognized over the initial three year term of the agreement 
finally  there was a decrease in royalty receivables of million due to reduced royalties on sales of allegra telfast resulting from the at risk launch of generic fexonfenadine in the fourth quarter of these decreases are partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased contract revenues and the timing of payments received from our customers 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the expansion and modification of our large scale manufacturing facilities  the construction of our research facilities in singapore and india  and development of an enterprise resource planning erp system 
for  we expect to incur million in capital expenditures  primarily related to the continued expansion and modification of our large scale manufacturing facilities  the continued outfitting of our research facilities in singapore and india  the continued development of our erp system  and the addition or replacement  as appropriate  of laboratory equipment for our discovery  development  and small scale manufacturing services 
in addition  in february  we completed the acquisition of comgenex  a chemistry services company based in budapest  hungary  for million in cash consideration 
we entered into a credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million line of credit to fund the acquisition of organichem during the term loan matures in february  as of december   the interest rate on million of the outstanding term loan balance was and the interest rate on the remaining million was 
on june   the company amended the credit facility to extend the maturity date on the line of credit from february to june the line of credit bears interest at a variable rate based on the company s leverage ratio 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the line of credit was the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum required operating cash flow coverage ratio  a minimum earnings before interest and taxes to interest ratio and a minimum current ratio 
other covenants include limits on asset disposals and the payment of dividends 
as of december  and we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted primarily from the reclassification of million in property and equipment as held for sale due to the closure of the mt 
prospect research center  an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments of million due to the collection of receivables a corresponding decrease in working capital of million and reduced capital expenditures in  and a decrease in the current portion of accrued pension benefits payable of million 
partially offsetting these increases in working capital were an increase in taxes payable of million due to the timing of income tax payments and an increase in unearned income of million due to the receipt of funds at the end of for customer projects that were performed in total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were predominantly in connection with expansion of our manufacturing facilities 
these expenditures were primarily financed through operating cash flows 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  resulting from million for the acquisition of property and equipment  partially offset by net proceeds from investment securities of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting of million in long term debt repayments  offset by million provided by stock option and stock purchase plan exercises 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
furthermore  a continued significant decrease in royalties from allegra would negatively affect our cash flow from operations and financial condition in future periods 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total under year years years after years long term debt principal long term debt interest operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions represents estimated interest payments on the company s long term debt based on current interest rates

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  unbilled revenue  income taxes  pension and postretirement benefit plans  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contract revenue recognition our contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers and reimbursed expenses under such contracts 
we also seek to include provisions in certain contracts which contain a combination of up front licensing fees  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology and expertise lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
reimbursed expenses consist of chemicals and other project specific costs 
we view contract revenue as our primary measure of revenue growth rather than licensing fees and royalties  which are dependent upon our licensees sales 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon days to one year s prior notice  depending on the size of the contract 
we generate contract revenue on the following basis full time equivalent fte 
an fte agreement establishes the number of our employees contracted for a project or a series of projects  the duration of the contract period  the price per fte  plus an allowance for chemicals and other project specific costs  which may or may not be incorporated in the fte rate 
typically  our fte contracts have terms of six months or longer 
our fte contracts typically provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
these contracts involve our scientists providing services on a best efforts basis in the development of novel chemistry for our customers 
there are no fixed deliverables as part of these services 
as such  we recognize revenue under fte contracts on a monthly basis as services are performed according to the terms of the contract 
time and materials 
under a time and materials contract we charge our customers an hourly rate plus an allowance for chemicals and other project specific costs 
we recognize revenue for time and material contracts based on the number of hours devoted to the project multiplied by the customer s billing rate plus other project specific costs incurred 
fixed fee 
under a fixed fee contract we charge a fixed agreed upon amount for a deliverable 
fixed fee contracts have fixed deliverables upon completion of the project 
we recognize revenue for fixed fee contracts after projects are completed  delivery is made and title transfers to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
up front license fees milestone and royalty revenue 
we analyze our agreements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and sab  revenue recognition 
allocation of revenue to individual elements which qualify for separate accounting is based on the estimated fair value of the respective elements 
generally  the provisions for licensing  milestone and royalty payments included in our contracts are related to the occurrence of specific identifiable events 
we will recognize revenue from up front non refundable licensing fees over the period we have continuing involvement in the underlying project 
we will recognize revenue arising from a milestone payment upon the successful achievement of the event  and the resolution of any uncertainties or contingencies regarding potential collection of the related payment  or  if appropriate  over the remaining term of the agreement 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue represents monies received for services that have not yet been performed as well as customer billings related to completed production which has not yet shipped 
as an added service  during we began to temporarily store completed cgmp production at our facilities for certain customers 
under these arrangements  upon completion of the customer project we typically will enter into a storage agreement with the customer 
we will temporarily store and subsequently ship the completed production  often in multiple shipments to multiple sites 
the revenue related to these arrangements is recognized at the time the products are ultimately shipped 
recurring royalty revenue recognition 
recurring royalties consist of royalties under a license agreement with sanofi aventis based on the worldwide sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
we record royalty revenue in the period in which the sales of allegra occur 
royalty payments from sanofi aventis are due within days after each calendar quarter and are determined based on sales of allegra telfast in that quarter 
restructuring charges the company accounts for its restructuring costs as required by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet certain requirements 
inventory inventory consists primarily of commercially available fine chemicals used as raw materials in the research and production process  work in process and finished goods at our large scale manufacturing location and chemical compounds in the form of natural product and novel compound collections 
we capitalize the costs associated with the production of our novel compound collections 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market 
we record reserves for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  which could result in a charge to operations 
goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company performs an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment or on an interim basis if certain triggering events occur 
a determination of impairment is made based upon the estimated discounted future cash flows of the operations associated with the related reporting unit 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired in the future the company would be required to record a charge to its results of operations 
factors the company considers important which could result in an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
total goodwill recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  was million  including million of goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of organichem corporation 
long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  the following a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in the market value of assets 
if the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company compares the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recorded 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds their fair value and will reduce only the carrying amounts of the long lived assets 
equity investments we have equity investments in leveraged private companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting for investments as our ownership interest in each customer is below and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entities 
we assess the fair value of these investments quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance  such as changes in market conditions  poor operating results of the underlying investments  or the inability of the entities to obtain additional financing indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
however  should the events and conditions that are indicative of impairment as noted above arise  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
total equity investments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  were million 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we maintain pension and postretirement costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and trends in health care costs  which are updated on an annual basis 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to absorb estimated receivable losses as circumstances arise that bring into doubt our ability to fully collect on outstanding receivable balances 
the allowance and related accounts receivable are reduced when the account is deemed uncollectible 
environmental liabilities in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  and has made provisions for the estimated financial impact of environmental cleanup related costs 
the quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors  including changing laws and regulations  advancements in environmental technologies  the quality of information available related to specific sites  the assessment stage of each site investigation  preliminary findings and the length of time involved in the remediation or settlement 
the company accrues environmental cleanup related costs when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
stock based compensation the company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for its fixed plan stock options 
as such  compensation expense would be recorded only if  on the date of grant  the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
any compensation expense would be recognized over the vesting period 
the company discloses the pro forma compensation cost for stock option grants in accordance with sfas no 
pro forma compensation cost is based on the fair value of the options on their grant date  and is recognized over the period of requisite service 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including expected volatility in the company s common share price  risk free interest rates  and the expected lives of the options granted  and are updated for each option grant 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including interest rates and the market for the company s common stock  as well as historical data regarding option exercises and forfeitures in making these assumptions 
changes in the related compensation costs associated with future grants may occur due to changes in the assumptions 
effective december   pursuant to and in accordance with the recommendation of the compensation committee the committee of the board of directors  the board of directors of the company approved full acceleration of the vesting of each otherwise unvested stock option that had an exercise price of or greater granted under the company s stock option and incentive plan the plan that was held by employees  officers  and non employee directors 
these options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of the company s common stock  based on the closing price of per share on december  ie  such options were underwater 
options to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock  including approximately  options held by executive officers  were subject to this acceleration 
the committee also required that  as a condition to the acceleration of vesting  each executive officer and each non employee director agree to refrain from selling shares of the company s common stock acquired upon the exercise of accelerated options other than shares needed to cover the exercise price and satisfy withholding taxes until the date on which the exercise of such options would have been permitted under the option s pre acceleration vesting terms or  if earlier  the officer s or director s last day of employment or upon a change in control as defined in the plan 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these underwater options was made primarily to minimize certain future compensation expenses that the company would otherwise recognize in its consolidated statements of income loss with respect to these options pursuant to sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which becomes effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december  the company also believes that the acceleration may have a positive effect on employee morale  retention and the perception of option value 
the acceleration had no effect on reported net income for the year ended december   and an approximate million  net of tax  impact on pro forma net income in the fourth quarter of income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the taxable income in the two previous tax years to which tax loss carryback can be applied 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  taxable income in the carryback period and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when considered necessary 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as defined in arb no 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
this statement applies to the company for the fiscal year ending december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

r  which amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in establishing standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  as well as transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees  except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
this statement applies to the company for the fiscal year ending december  in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  share based payment 
sab provides guidance on the initial implementation of sfas no 
r 
in particular  sab includes guidance related to share based payment awards for non employees  valuation methods  and selecting underlying assumptions such as expected volatility and expected terms 
the company will adopt sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective approach 
the modified prospective approach requires that compensation expense be recorded for restricted stock  all unvested stock options outstanding as of january   and any share based payments issued after the effective date  as well as for the portion of the purchase discount on the market price of the company s common stock offered to employees in conjunction with the company s employee stock purchase plan espp that is considered compensatory based on the guidance in sfas no 
r 
we expect to continue using the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments 
for pro forma footnote disclosure purposes  we recognized our share based compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period as permitted by sfas no 
 and we expect to continue to use this method of recognition upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r will also require us to change the classification of any tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of that which is associated with the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes 
these amounts will be presented as a financing cash inflow rather than as an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented 
the specific impact of the adoption cannot be predicted because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  the differences between actual and estimated forfeitures of stock options and restricted shares  and the level of participation in the company s employee stock purchase plan espp 
the company s stock options and restricted stock vest over a five year period 
based on options and restricted shares outstanding at december   using expected forfeiture rates of and for stock options and restricted shares  respectively  and assuming historical levels of participation in the espp  the company expects to recognize share based compensation expense of approximately  and  in and  respectively  as a result of the adoption of sfas no

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides guidance in applying the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as they relate to conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin requires that entities recognize a liability for the fair value of conditional asset retirement obligations if their fair values can be reasonably estimated 
the company has identified legal obligations related to environmental remediation matters at its rensselaer  ny facility 
the liability associated with these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated due to the fact that a settlement date cannot be determined 
management does not believe that these items are material to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows as of december  also  the adoption of fin would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows had it been applied to all periods presented 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate its obligation as necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in these rates as discussed below 
the company has research facilities in singapore and india and therefore is subject to foreign currency risk 
this risk is composed of both potential losses from the translation of foreign currency financial statements and the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions 
the total net assets of non us operations denominated in non functional currencies subject to potential loss amount to approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately  furthermore  related to foreign currency transactions  the company has exposure to non functional currency balances totaling approximately  this amount includes  on an absolute basis  exposures to foreign currency assets and liabilities 
on a net basis  the company had approximately  of foreign currency liabilities as of december  as currency rates change  these non functional currency balances are revalued  and the corresponding adjustment is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
a hypothetical change of in currency rates could result in an adjustment to the consolidated statement of income of approximately  with respect to interest rates  the risk is composed of changes in future cash flows due to changes in interest rates on our variable rate million term loan and million industrial development authority bonds 
to mitigate this risk  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that have fixed the interest rate on of our variable rate debt 
included in other assets is approximately  which represents the estimated market value of the swap agreements 
the potential loss in cash flows from a adverse change in quoted interest rates would approximate
