item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of arbor realty trust  inc 
and subsidiaries you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation that was formed in june to invest in real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans  including junior participating interests in first mortgages  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we also invest in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size of our asset portfolio 
credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximizing the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
as the size of the portfolio increases  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income may be held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
unlike other subsidiaries of a reit  the income of a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes related to these taxable subsidiaries has not been material as they have had minimal activity 
on july   arbor commercial mortgage acm  our manager  contributed million of structured finance assets  encumbered by million of borrowings in exchange for an equity interest in our operating partnership represented by  units of limited partnership interest and  warrants to acquire additional units of limited partnership interest 
in addition  certain employees of acm became our employees 
we are externally managed and advised by acm and pay acm a management fee in accordance with a management agreement

our loan portfolio balance at december  was billion  with a weighted average current interest pay rate of  as compared to million  with a weighted average current interest pay rate of  at december  at december   advances on financing facilities totaled billion  with a weighted average funding cost of excluding a million participation in one of our loans  as compared to million  with a weighted average funding cost of  at december  additionally  our joint venture investment portfolio at december  was million as compared to million at december  in january  we completed a non recourse collateralized debt obligation cdo transaction  whereby a portfolio of real estate related assets were contributed to a consolidated subsidiary which issued million of investment grade rated floating rate notes in a private placement 
the subsidiary retained the equity interest in the portfolio with a value of approximately million 
the notes are secured by a portfolio of real estate related assets with a face value of approximately million  consisting primarily of bridge loans  mezzanine loans and junior participating interests in first mortgages  and by approximately million of cash available for acquisitions of loans and other permitted investments 
the notes have an initial weighted average spread of approximately basis points over three month libor 
the facility has a four year replenishment period that allows the principal proceeds from repayments of the collateral assets to be reinvested in qualifying replacement assets  subject to certain conditions 
we intend to own the portfolio of real estate related assets until its maturity and have accounted for this transaction on our balance sheet as a financing 
these proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt with higher costs of funds 
in connection with the cdo  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor 
on january   we completed our second non recourse collateralized debt obligation cdo ii transaction  whereby a portfolio of real estate related assets were contributed to a consolidated subsidiary which issued million of investment grade rated floating rate notes in a private placement

these proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt with higher costs of funds 
in connection with cdo ii  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor as well as interest rate swaps on current and future projected libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily through interest received from making real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in   and for the period ended december   respectively 
interest income is also derived from profits of equity participation interests 
in and  interest income from participation interests represented approximately million and million  or and of total revenues  respectively 
no income was derived from this source in we also derive interest income from our investments in mortgage related securities 
in and  interest on these investments represented approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
no income was derived from this source in additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan structuring and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented less than  less than and of our total revenues in  and the period ended december   respectively 
income from equity affiliates and gain on sale of loans and real estate we derive income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting 
we record our share of the net income and losses from the underlying properties on a single line item in the consolidated income statements as income from equity affiliates 
the company is not required to fund losses incurred by the joint venture 
therefore  the company only recognizes its share of losses to the extent of its capital investment 
in and  income from equity affiliates totaled million and million  respectively 
we also may derive income from the gain on sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate for our own investment and  upon stabilization  disposition at an anticipated return and real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
no such income has been recorded to date 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear in financial statements and supplementary data 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are 
table of contents particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
loans and investments statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading depending on ability and intent 
securities held for sale are reported at fair value  while securities and investments held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
we do not have any trading securities at this time 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  unless such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of collateral on an individual loan basis 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by an evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  and estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
an allowance for each loan would be maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
as of december   and  no impairment has been identified and no valuation allowances have been established 
repurchase obligations in certain circumstances  we have financed the purchase of investments from counterparty through a repurchase agreement with that same counterparty 
we currently record these investments in the same manner as other investments financed with repurchase agreements  with the investment recorded as an asset and the related borrowing under any repurchase agreement as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
interest income earned on the investments and interest expense incurred on the repurchase obligations are reported separately on the consolidated income statement 
there is discussion  based upon a technical interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas  that these transactions may not qualify as a purchase by us 
we believe  and it is industry practice  that we are accounting for these transactions in an appropriate manner  however  if these investments do not qualify as a purchase under sfas  we would be required to present the net investment on our balance sheet as a derivative with the corresponding change in fair value of the derivative being recorded in the income statement 
the value of the derivative would reflect not only changes in the value of the underlying investment  but also changes in the value of the underlying credit provided by the counterparty 
as of december  we had entered into eight such transactions  with a book value of the associated assets of million financed with repurchase obligations of million 
as of december   we had entered into eleven such transactions  with a book value of the associated assets of million financed with repurchase obligations of million 
adoption of the aforementioned treatment would result in these assets and liabilities being recorded net on our balance sheets 
available for sale securities we invest in agency sponsored whole pool mortgage related securities 
pools of federal national mortgage association  or fnma  and federal home loan mortgage corporation  or fhlmc  adjustable 
table of contents rate residential mortgage loans underlie these mortgage related securities 
we receive payments from the payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans  which have a fixed rate of interest for three years and adjust annually thereafter 
these securities are carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
unrealized losses other than temporary losses are recognized currently in income 
capitalized interest the company capitalizes interest in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
capitalization of interest costs in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method 
this statement amended sfas no 
capitalization of interest costs to include investments equity  loans and advances accounted for by the equity method as qualifying assets of the investor while the investee has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations  provided that the investee s activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets for its operations 
an investee  in one of the company s joint ventures accounted for using the equity method  is in the process of using funds to acquire qualifying assets for its planned principal operations 
during the year ended december  the company capitalized million of interest relating to this investment  there was no capitalization of interest during the year ended december   or in the period june  to december  revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and available for sale securities 
in many instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  and deferred interest upon maturity 
in some cases interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising at the purchase or origination 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or available for sale security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination regarding collectibility  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess cash flows being distributed and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r as a revision to fin no 
 which requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary pb 
the pb is the party that absorbs a majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or a majority of the expected returns 
we have evaluated our loans and investments and investments in equity affiliates to determine whether they are variable interests in a vie 
this evaluation resulted in us determining that our mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments and investments in equity affiliates were potential variable interests 
for each of these investments  we have evaluated the sufficiency of the fair value of the entities equity investments at risk to absorb losses  that as a group the holders of the equity investments at risk have a the direct or indirect ability through voting rights to make decisions about the entities significant activities  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity and their obligations are not protected directly or 
table of contents indirectly  c the right to receive the expected residual return of the entity and their rights are not capped  the voting rights of some of these investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity  their rights to receive the expected returns of the equity  or both  and that substantially all of the entities activities do not involve or are not conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
as of december   we have identified thirteen loans and investments which were made to entities determined to be vie s 
a summary of our identified vie s is presented in note of our consolidated financial statements  which appear in financial statements and supplementary data 
however  for the thirteen vie s identified  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiaries and as such the vie s should not be consolidated in our financial statements 
for all other investments  we have determined they are not vie s 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with financial accounting statement fas  the carrying values of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged liabilities are reflected at their fair value 
we rely on quotations from a third party to determine these fair values 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are adjusted to fair value through income 
because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see the market risk section 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb published sfas r entitled share based payment 
it requires all public companies to report share based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related share based awards 
we are required to adopt the provisions of the standard effective for periods beginning after june  we believe that our current method of accounting for share based payments is consistent with sfas r 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus in eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights issue  which provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership 
issue states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s business and thereby preclude the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the partnership 
the adoption of issue by us for new or modified limited partnership arrangements is effective june  and for existing limited partnership arrangements effective january  we do not expect that we will be required to consolidate our current unconsolidated joint venture investments nor do we expect issue to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fasb addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fasb 
table of contents statement no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the fsp nullifies certain requirements of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments and supersedes eitf abstracts  topics d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
the fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

for accounting purposes  cdo is consolidated in our financial statements 
on january   we completed our second non recourse collateralized debt obligation transaction  or cdo ii  whereby million of real estate related and other assets were contributed to a newly formed consolidated subsidiary which issued million of investment grade rated floating rate notes in a private placement 
these notes are secured by the portfolio of assets and pay interest quarterly at a weighted average rate of approximately basis points over a floating rate of interest based on three month libor 
cdo ii may be replenished with substitute collateral for loans that are repaid during the first five years 
thereafter  the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid 
proceeds from cdo ii were used to repay outstanding debt under our existing facilities totaling million 
by contributing these real estate assets to cdo ii  this transaction resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to cdo ii s assets and created capacity in our existing credit facilities

if such cash is not used to replenish collateral  it could have a negative impact on our anticipated returns 
for accounting purposes  cdo ii is consolidated in our financial statements 
in  we  through newly formed wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership  issued a total of million of junior subordinated notes in five separate private placements  described in note debt obligations of our consolidated financial statements  which appears in financial statements and supplementary data consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries 
these securities are unsecured  have a maturity of to years  pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of interest based on three month libor and  absent the occurrence of special events  are not redeemable during the first five years 
at december   the outstanding balance under these facilities was million with a current weighted average note rate of 
the warehouse credit agreement  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay interest monthly  based on pricing over libor 
the amount of our pricing over libor varies depending upon the structure of the loan or investment financed pursuant to the specific agreement 
the warehouse credit agreement  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay down borrowings under these facilities pro rata as principal payments on our 
table of contents loans and investments are received 
in addition  if upon maturity of a loan or investment we decide to grant the borrower an extension option  the financial institutions have the option to extend the borrowings or request payment in full on the outstanding borrowings of the loan or investment extended 
the financial institutions also have the right to request immediate payment of any outstanding borrowings on any loan or investment that is at least days delinquent 
as of december   these facilities had an aggregate capacity of billion and borrowings were approximately billion 
each of the credit facilities contains various financials covenants and restrictions  including minimum net worth and debt to equity ratios 
in addition to the financial terms and capacities described above  our credit facilities generally contain covenants that prohibit us from effecting a change in control  disposing of or encumbering assets being financed and restrict us from making any material amendment to our underwriting guidelines without approval of the lender 
if we violate these covenants in any of our credit facilities  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of these covenants may result in our being unable to borrow unused amounts under our credit facilities  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under these credit facilities 
we have a junior loan participation with a total outstanding balance at december  of million 
this participation borrowing has a maturity date equal to the corresponding mortgage loan and is secured by the participant s interest in the mortgage loan 
interest expense is based on a portion of the interest received from the loan 
in  we have entered into two junior loan participations with a total outstanding balance at december  of million 
these participation borrowings have maturity dates equal to the corresponding mortgage loan and are secured by the participant s interest in the mortgage loan 
interest expense is based on a portion of the interest received from the loan 
we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term liquidity within one year and long term liquidity needs 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future investments  fund operating costs and fund distributions to our stockholders 
our loans and investments are financed under existing credit facilities and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to renew our sources of financing on substantially similar terms or at all  it would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our significant capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements  including expected new lending and investment opportunities 
in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations is generally used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
when making distributions  we borrow the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities 
to date  all distributions have been funded in this manner 
all funds borrowed to make distributions have been repaid by funds generated from operations

table of contents per annum of our operating partnership s equity in excess of million 
the base management fee is not calculated based on the manager s performance or the types of assets its selects for investment on our behalf  but it is affected by the performance of these assets because it is based on the value of our operating partnership s equity 
we incurred million and million in base management fees for services rendered in and  respectively 
incentive compensation 
pursuant to the management agreement  our manager is also entitled to receive incentive compensation in an amount equal to of the amount by which a our operating partnership s funds from operations per operating partnership unit  adjusted for certain gains and losses  exceeds b the product of x the greater of per annum or the ten year us treasury rate plus  and y the weighted average of i  ii the offering price per share of our common stock including any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of warrants or options in any subsequent offerings adjusted for any prior capital dividends or distributions  and iii the issue price per operating partnership unit for subsequent contributions to our operating partnership  multiplied by the weighted average of our operating partnership s outstanding operating partnership units 
in  our manager earned a total of million of incentive compensation and elected to receive it partially in cash totaling million and partially in  shares of common stock 
in  our manager earned million of incentive compensation which was paid in  shares of common stock 
we pay the annual incentive compensation in four installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive compensation are subject to recalculation and potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year 
subject to the ownership limitations in our charter  at least of this incentive compensation is payable to our manager in shares of our common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last days of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive compensation is being paid 
the incentive compensation is accrued as it is earned 
in accordance with issue b of eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the expense incurred for incentive compensation paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive compensation paid to our manager in the form of common stock in accordance with issue a of eitf which discusses how to measure at the measurement date when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  the expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the annual incentive compensation is determined 
in the event that the annual incentive compensation calculated as of the measurement date is less than the four quarterly installments of the annual incentive compensation paid in advance  our manager will refund the amount of such overpayment in cash and we would record a negative incentive compensation expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined

table of contents compensation for the month period preceding the termination 
if  without cause  we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement for any other reason  including a change of control of us  we are required to pay a termination fee equal to two times the base management fee and incentive compensation paid for the month period preceding the termination 
inflation in our two most recent fiscal years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our net income and revenue 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
additionally  we also have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be effected

table of contents management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the structured finance business of arbor commercial mortgage  llc and subsidiaries you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements and selected consolidated financial information of the structured finance business of arbor commercial mortgage  llc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of the structured finance business of arbor commercial mortgage  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview and basis of presentation on july  acm contributed a portfolio of structured finance investments and related liabilities to our operating partnership 
in addition  certain employees of acm related to its structured finance business became our employees 
these assets  liabilities and employees represented a substantial portion of acm s structured finance business  which historically invested in real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans  preferred equity and other real estate related assets 
the structured finance business of acm is not a separate legal entity and the assets and liabilities associated with acm s structured finance business are components of a larger business 
we obtained the information in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report from acm s consolidated historical accounting records 
the structured finance business of acm never operated as a separate business segment or division of acm  but as an integrated part of acm s consolidated business 
accordingly  the statements of revenue and direct operating expenses do not include charges from acm for corporate general and administrative expense because acm considered such items to be corporate expenses and did not allocate them to individual business units 
these expenses included costs for acm s executive management  corporate facilities and overhead costs  corporate accounting and treasury functions  corporate legal matters and other similar costs 
the information in the statements of revenue and direct operating expenses include the revenue and direct operating expenses that relate to the structured finance business 
direct operating expenses include interest expense applicable to the funding costs of the structured finance business loans and investments  salaries and related fringe benefit costs  provision for loan losses and other expenses directly associated with revenue generating activities 
direct operating expenses also include allocations of certain expenses  such as telephone  office equipment rental and maintenance  office supplies and marketing  which were directly associated with the structured finance business and were allocated based on headcount of the structured finance business in relation to the total headcount of acm 
all of these allocations are based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the consolidated financial statements in this report do not include a statement of cash flows because the structured finance business did not maintain a separate cash balance 
other than the debt required to fund the loans and investments of the structured finance business  operating activities of the structured finance business were funded by acm 
since the structured finance business never operated as a separate business division or segment of acm  the consolidated financial statements included in this report are not intended to be a complete presentation of the historical financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the structured finance business 
these consolidated financial statements were prepared for inclusion in this report and do not purport to reflect the financial position or results of operations that would have resulted if the structured finance business had operated as a separate company 
the historical consolidated financial information included in this report is not likely to be indicative of our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for any future period 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily from interest received from making real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments 
we provide bridge loans secured by first lien 
table of contents mortgages on the property to borrowers who are typically seeking short term capital to be used in an acquisition of property 
the bridge loans we make typically range in size from million to million and have terms of up to seven years 
we provide real property owners with mezzanine loans that are secured by pledges of ownership interests in entities that directly or indirectly control the real property or second mortgages 
these loans typically range in size from million to million and have terms of up to seven years 
we also make preferred equity investments in entities that directly or indirectly own real property 
interest represented and of total revenue for the six months ended june  and june   respectively 
we also derive operating revenue from other income that includes several types of income that are recorded upon receipt 
certain of our loans and investments provide for additional payments based on the borrower s operating cash flow  appreciation of the underlying collateral  payments calculated based on timing of when the loan pays off and changes in interest rates 
such amounts are not readily determinable and are recorded as other income upon receipt 
other income also includes the recognition of deferred revenue on loans that prepay  asset management fees related to our loans and investment portfolio and satisfactions on impaired loans in excess of carrying values 
other income represented and of total revenue for the six months ended june  and june   respectively 
gain on sale of loans and real estate and income from equity affiliates we also derive income from the gain on sale of loans and real estate 
we acquire real estate for our own investment and  upon stabilization  disposition at an anticipated return and real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
in addition  we derive income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that acm s structured finance business formed with equity partners to lend to  acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these investments are recorded under the equity method 
we record our share of net income from the underlying properties invested in through these joint ventures 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
real estate owned real estate owned represents commercial real estate property that the structured finance business of acm owns and operates 
such assets are not depreciated and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell 
management reviews its real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
loans and investments loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  unless such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
acm s structured finance business historically invested in preferred equity interests that allowed acm to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 

table of contents specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of collateral on an individual loan basis 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by an evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  and estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for each loan is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
revenue recognition the revenue recognition policies for acm s structured finance business are as follows interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned 
in most instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  and deferred interest upon maturity of the loan 
this additional income as well as any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination regarding collectibility  interest income is recognized only upon actual receipt 
results of operations six months ended june  and revenue 
the following table sets forth the components of revenue six months ended june  increase amount percent unaudited interest income other income total revenue interest income increased million  or  to million for the six months ended june  from million for the six months ended june  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the weighted average balance of loans and investment partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average effective interest rate of loans and investments primarily due to a decline in market interest rates 
most of our loans and investments are variable rate instruments based on libor 
the negative impact to interest income as a result of the decrease in market interest rates was partially offset by interest rate floors that were in effect on many of our loans and investments 
other income increased million  or  to million for the six months ended june  from million for the six months ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to a the partial satisfaction of an impaired loan for an amount million in excess of the loan s carrying value resulting in the recognition of other income for this amount b increased funds received on paid off loans of million and c increased accelerated amortization of revenue of million on loans with early payoffs

employee compensation and benefits increased million  or  to million for the six months ended june  from million for the six months ended june  this increase reflects increased staffing levels associated with the increased loan and investments opportunities 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the six months ended june  from million for the six months ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to operating expenses incurred in for a real estate owned asset  and increased marketing expenses associated with the growth of the lending and investment activities 
provision for loan losses decreased million  or  to million for the six months ended june  from million for the six months ended june  this decrease was directly attributable to a million provision for loan losses recorded in prior to this loan being foreclosed and reclassified to real estate owned 
this provision was recorded to reflect this asset at its estimated fair value

the following table sets forth our gain on sale of loans and real estate and income from equity affiliates six months ended june  decrease amount percent unaudited gain on sale of loans and real estate income from equity affiliates gain on sale of loans and real estate decreased million  or  to million for the six months ended june  from million for the six months ended june  this decrease was primarily attributable to a million gain on the sale of a joint venture interest in march partially offset by a million gain on the partial liquidation of a joint venture interest in income from equity affiliates for the six months ended june  consist of net income from a joint venture interest recognized prior to the sale of that joint venture interest in march pro forma effect of arbor commercial mortgage s asset contribution on results of operations we were formed in june to operate as a real estate investment trust and to expand the structured finance business of acm 
on july   we completed a private placement of our units  each consisting of five shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock 
gross proceeds from the private placement totaled million 
in exchange for a commensurate equity ownership in our operating subsidiary  acm contributed million of structured finance assets subject to million of borrowings supported by million of equity 
these assets and liabilities were contributed at book value  
table of contents which approximates fair value  and represent of the assets and of the liabilities of acm s structured finance business as of june  in addition  certain employees of acm were transferred to us 
we are externally managed and advised by acm and pay acm a management fee in accordance with the terms of the management agreement 
acm also sources originations  provides underwriting services and services all structured finance assets on our behalf 
as a result  the operating expenses as presented in the historical consolidated financial statements of acm s structured finance business would have been affected had we been formed at an earlier time 
employee compensation and benefits expense would have decreased by million for the six months ended june  because these costs would have been borne by acm under terms of the management agreement 
similarly  selling and administrative expense would have decreased by million for the six months ended june  in accordance with the management agreement  we will pay acm a management fee  composed of a base management fee and incentive compensation 
the base management fee is per annum of the first million of equity 
the incentive compensation is equal to of the amount that our funds from operations per operating partnership unit  adjusted for certain gains and losses  exceeds the product of x per annum or the ten year us treasury rate plus  whichever is greater and y the weighted average of the book value of the net assets contributed by acm to our operating partnership per operating partnership unit  the offering price per share in the private placement  the offering price per share of our common stock in subsequent offerings and the issue price per operating partnership unit for subsequent contributions to our operating partnership  multiplied by the weighted average of our operating partnership s outstanding units 
this pro forma information does not reflect the results of the private placement 
however  gross proceeds from the private placement totaled million  which combined with acm s equity contribution of million  resulted in total contributed capital of million 
offering expenses of million were paid or accrued by us  resulting in stockholders equity and minority interest of million as a result of the private placement 
the pro forma consolidated financial information is limited to adjustments that are directly attributable to the private placement  expected to have a continuing impact on us and are factually supportable 
these adjustments are based on the assumption that certain compensation and benefits expenses and certain selling and administrative expenses incurred by the structured finance business of acm would not have been incurred if we had been in operation during the periods presented 
the pro forma financial results do not include what the impact would have been had the gross proceeds from the private placement been available to the structured finance business of acm during the entire period 
had these proceeds been available to the structured finance business of acm during the entire period  there would have been an impact on certain revenues and expenses  including the management fees payable pursuant to the management agreement 
the management fees are calculated based on such factors as funds from operations and equity of our operating partnership  each as defined in the management agreement 
such amounts represent speculative and forward looking information that is not factually supportable 
the financial statements of the structured finance business of acm include the results of operations of the structured finance business segment of acm and are not limited to the results of the structured finance assets that were transferred to arbor realty trust 
accordingly  the results of certain investments in equity affiliates that were not transferred to arbor realty trust have been included in the financial statements of the structured finance business of acm because they were included in the structured finance business segment even though the operating results from these equity affiliates have not been material to the structured finance business segment as a whole 
in addition  acm retained certain transactions in its structured finance portfolio with a net book value of approximately million  primarily because they were not deemed to be suitable investments for arbor realty trust 
had these retained assets been excluded from the financial statements of the structured finance business of acm  additional adjustments to the expense base would have been necessary to estimate what expenses would have been had these assets not been in the portfolio 
such adjustments would have been speculative 
lastly  operating results for assets that matured before the 
table of contents contribution of structured finance assets to arbor realty trust  but were in the portfolio of assets of the structured finance business of acm during the reporting period are also included in these statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the consummation of the private placement and the related formation transactions  substantially all of the operations of the structured finance business of acm have been conducted by us 
therefore  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk relating to the structured finance business of acm are not presented 
a description of market risks relating to our business is presented in this item a of this report under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk  interest rate risk  market value risk and prepayment risk 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property s debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
many of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
based on the loans and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million primarily due to the fact that the principal amount of loans subject to interest rate adjustment exceeds the liabilities that would be subject to an interest rate adjustment 
this is primarily due to our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a decrease  partially offset by loans currently subject to interest rate floors and  therefore  not be subject to the full downward interest rate adjustment 
as of december   a increase in libor would have increased our annual net income and cash flows in the subsequent twelve months by approximately million as the principal amount of loans subject to interest rate adjustment exceeds the liabilities that would be subject to an interest rate adjustment 
as of december   a decrease in libor would have decreased our annual net income and cash flows in the subsequent twelve months by approximately million as the principal amount of loans subject to interest rate adjustment exceeds the liabilities that would be subject to an interest rate adjustment  partially 
table of contents offset by loans currently subject to interest rate floors and  therefore  not be subject to the full downward interest rate adjustment 
in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we invest in securities  which are designated as available for sale 
these securities are adjustable rate securities that have a fixed component for three years and  thereafter  generally reset annually 
these securities are financed with a repurchase agreement that bears interest at a rate of one month libor plus 
since the repricing of the debt obligations occurs more quickly than the repricing of the securities  on average  our cost of borrowings will rise more quickly in response to an increase in market interest rates than the earnings rate on the securities 
this will result in a reduction to our net interest income and cash flows related to these securities 
based on the securities and borrowings as of december   and assuming the balances of these securities and borrowings remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would reduce our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
a decrease in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
as of december   assuming the balances of these securities and borrowings remained unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would have reduced our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
a decrease in libor would have increased our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
in connection with our cdos described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the investor s return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
these swaps were executed on december  and december  having notional values of million and million  respectively  as described in note summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements  which appears in financial statements and supplementary data consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries 
the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by slightly more than million  if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by slightly less than million 
as of december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately  if there had been a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately  in connection with the issuance of variable rate junior subordinate notes during as described in note debt obligations of art s consolidated financial statements  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in june with total notional values of million as described in note summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements  which appears in financial statements and supplementary data consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries 
the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december  if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million 
in december  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements having notional values of million and million  as described in note summary of significant accounting policies of 
table of contents art s consolidated financial statements  to hedge current and outstanding libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december  if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
market value risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors  however  given that these securities are guaranteed as to principal and or interest by an agency of the us government  such fluctuations are generally not based on the creditworthiness of the mortgages securing these securities 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase 
prepayment risk as we receive repayments of principal on these securities  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income using the effective yield method through the expected maturity dates of the securities 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the securities
