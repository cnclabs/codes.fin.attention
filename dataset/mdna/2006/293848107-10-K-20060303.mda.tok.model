these services represent a significant portion of our revenues  but are closely related to the demand for our products 
in addition  the margins on our products are significantly higher than margins on our services 
as a result  we are primarily focused on growing our product revenues 
entrust sells its solutions globally  with an emphasis on north america  europe and asia 
these primary areas have demonstrated the most potential for early adoption of the broadest set of entrust solutions 
entrust extends to other non core geographies through strategic partner relationships  which increases the leverage of our direct sales channel worldwide 
in north america  entrust is targeting a return to revenue growth in its software business by leveraging entrust s historical strength in selling to key verticals such as government federal  state  provincial  financial services and healthcare organizations 
europe is a region where entrust s products and solutions continue to experience strong demand and we believe that the european market will provide growth  with increased momentum from governments and enterprises leveraging entrust s solutions to transform their business processes and to leverage the internet and networking applications 
we market and sell our products and services in both the enterprise and government market space 
in  of our product sales were in our extended government vertical market  which includes healthcare 
this is an increase of more than as compared with the increase in revenue has been driven by key global projects that have started to increase product purchases 
in the extended government vertical market  we have a strong penetration in the us federal government  the governments of canada  singapore  denmark  the united kingdom and across continental europe 
in q   the spanish government selected our digital certificate technology to incorporate into its national id card 
as governments continue to increase spending on e government initiatives and information security projects  we are well positioned to help them 
in  of our product sales were in our extended enterprise vertical market 
the enterprise market in was driven by our new product traction  new customers  and continued growth in transactions under thousand in revenue 
in the  of product transactions and of product revenue came from new products 
in  we added new customers  which is an increase of from the new customers in we continue to see demand from global enterprises as they continue to respond to regulatory and governance compliance demands and extend their internal and external networks to more and more individuals inside and outside their domain 
a key driver of our product growth has been the recent spotlight on identity theft due to breaches at companies like choicepoint and lexisnexis 
these breaches have proven that self regulation over the past few years has been insufficient at addressing the underlying issues 
recent legislation has addressed these concerns 
california sb has cast more visibility on the issue for citizens  corporations  and the government 
the law requires both corporations and the government to notify california residents if their sensitive data has been breached unless encryption technology is deployed 
additionally  other states have now passed breach notification requirements  and another states have legislation waiting to be enacted 
on a national level  bills are being written to protect citizens from identity theft and alert them if their information has been stolen 

table of contents entrust for years has been a leader in secure digital identities and information 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced identityguard which is our easy to use second factor of authentication 
we now have pilots under way for identityguard 
in identityguard accounted for of total product revenue 
identityguard s low cost relative to hardware  its simplicity for the mass market  and its effectiveness in countering online theft and phishing  are the key drivers for the increased traction we are experiencing 
along with the traction for second factor authentication  we are also seeing customers increasingly interested in data protection and encryption 
with a combination of entrust identityguard  getaccess and truepass  customers can accomplish authentication and role based access control  digital signature  and encryption from one solution provider 
entrust has a goal to develop new channels to market  in addition to our direct sales force 
in the second quarter of  our largest deal was through our partnership with sia  with whom we won the national id card 
our largest identityguard transaction in the third quarter and the second quarter of  were also with strategic regional distribution partners 
we have been successful in developing a number of these regional channels to market 
in addition to our regional partners  a focus in was developing an indirect channel to market in the us for our strong authentication  encryption and e mail compliance solutions 
on july   entrust announced a distribution agreement with access distribution  a general electric company  to become the first two tier distributor to offer entrust s industry leading security solutions to authorized value added resellers in the us and canada 
at the end of  we signed up eight value added resellers under our agreement with access distribution  but have yet to achieve any sales through these resellers 
entrust relies significantly on large deals in each quarter 
our software revenue from our top five customers in q  was approximately of our total revenue in that quarter and we had one product deal over million 
this was within our historical range  which is generally between and of revenue from the top five customers and zero to four transactions over million 
although our revenue in the second half of and allowed us to return to profitability  we continue to be impacted from time to time on our software revenue by the timing of our customers buying process  which may include proof of concepts  senior management reviews and budget delays that sometimes results in longer than anticipated sales cycles 
we are also impacted by our customers recent buying behavior  which is to buy only for immediate need as opposed to making a larger purchase in order to get a better discount 
any of these factors may impact our revenue on a quarterly basis 
our management uses the following metrics to measure performance number and average size of product revenue transactions  number of deals over million  top five product revenue transactions as a percentage of total revenues  product revenue split between extended enterprise and extended government verticals  product revenue split between three key product areas emerging growth markets  public key infrastructure and single sign on  geographic revenue split  product and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues  and deferred revenue  cash and marketable investment balances 

table of contents business overview during  we continued our strategy of focusing on core vertical and geographic markets 
revenues of million represented an increase over  and consisted of product sales and services and maintenance 
services and maintenance revenues increased over  due to improved demand for both consulting services and support and maintenance services  while product revenues increased from  primarily driven by an improved product transaction closure rate compared to  despite a lower average purchase value compared to net income in was million  or per share  compared to a net income of million  or per share in  with total expenses increasing to million in net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to cash generated of million in entrust secure identity management solutions accounted for of product revenue  which is an increase of from entrust certificate services revenues  a component of our secure identity management solutions suite increased over entrust secure messaging solutions accounted for of product revenue  which is an increase of from entrust secure data solutions accounted for of product revenue  which is a decrease of from our pki products revenue increased over extended government accounted for  an increase of over  and extended enterprise accounted for of the product revenue in the financial services sector of the extended enterprise vertical increased to of product revenue in  down from other highlights from included the average purchase size in was  which was a decrease from  in total transactions in reached  which is up from transactions in we added new customers in  which represented a increase from our support and maintenance revenues were the highest in our history 
in  we achieved the sixth consecutive year of increasing support revenues 
entrust s support and maintenance delivered its highest fourth quarter revenue in the company s history 
entrust certificate services achieved its th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the fourth quarter of we achieved a second consecutive year of annual profitability  with a net income of million in  the highest annual net income in our history  representing a increase over our new products identityguard and boundary messaging represented of total product revenue or million for  compared to thousand in entrust identityguard finished its first year of commercial availability with customers and pilots  reaching sales of million 
sales for the year represented million identityguard licenses shipped to customers such as shufa  the government of sweden  commercebank  and a number of leading government and financial institutions worldwide 
we signed eight value added resellers under our us distribution network 
as part of our share purchase program  we purchased million shares in for million at an average share price of 
as a result  we ended with million in cash and marketable securities and no debt 
we unveiled identityguard  a market first in the delivery of a flexible  strong  risk based mutual authentication platform 
the new capabilities allow organizations to reduce the risk of online identity attacks while fitting seamlessly into the user experience at a fraction of the cost of conventional hardware tokens 
we also announced that our entrust identityguard solution now offers strong authentication for remote access applications 
the result is a solution that works  off the shelf  with leading remote access products by leveraging the radius protocol  a standard supported by leading remote access products 
we announced that identityguard was selected by nine of sweden s largest public agencies to provide strong authentication to over  users 
implemented by entrust s partner in the nordic market  
table of contents pointsec mobile technologies ab pointsec  entrust identityguard is expected to play an important role in the new government electronic id platform that will be used to offer a range of new online services and secure communications to both citizens and businesses 
we also announced that commercebank  one of the largest privately held banks in south florida  will deploy entrust identityguard to over  customers across florida 
the ministry of economic development of new zealand has decided to deploy entrust identityguard to all users across the department to secure remote access to sensitive applications via citrix metaframe 
this deployment is intended to replace a token solution that  due to high cost  is only used to provide authentication capability for a small sub set of employees 
finally  we announced that schufa  a german credit rating agency  will provide access to personal credit information via their new user portal  which will use entrust identityguard to provide strong authentication 
critical accounting policies in  our most complex accounting judgments were made in the areas of software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring charges and related adjustments  accounting for long term strategic and equity investments  the provision for income taxes and stock based compensation 
the restructuring and related charges are not anticipated to be recurring in nature 
however  the financial reporting of restructuring and related charges will continue to require judgments until such time as the corresponding accruals are fully paid out and or no longer required 
software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for long term strategic and equity investments  provision for income taxes  and stock based compensation are expected to continue to be ongoing elements of our critical accounting processes and judgments 
software revenue recognition with respect to software revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and related accounting guidance and pronouncements 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  we routinely apply judgments to the application of software revenue recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
we analyze various factors  including a review of the specifics of each transaction  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenues and cost recognized 
different judgments and or different contract structures could lead to different accounting conclusions  which could have a material effect on our reported earnings 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized when we have received an executed license agreement or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  the software has been shipped if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  the fees are fixed and determinable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
this policy is applicable to all sales transactions  including sales to resellers and end user customers 
license revenues are generated both through direct sales to end users as well as through various partners  including system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
license revenue is recognized when the sale has occurred for an identified end user  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we are notified of a sale by a reseller to the end user customer in the same period that the actual sale took place 
we do not offer a right of return on sales of our software products 
for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
sales to our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement 
table of contents governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the documented agreement 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable at the onset  we recognize revenue when the fee becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess if collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we do not record revenue until such time as collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we do not generally include acceptance provisions in arrangements with customers 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we are sometimes subject to fiscal funding clauses in our software licensing transactions with the united states government and its agencies 
such clauses generally provide that the license is cancelable if the legislature or funding authority does not appropriate the funds necessary for the governmental unit to fulfill its obligations under the licensing arrangement 
in these circumstances  software licensing arrangements with governmental organizations containing a fiscal funding clause are evaluated to determine whether the uncertainty of a possible license arrangement cancellation is remote 
if the likelihood of cancellation is assessed as remote  then the software licensing arrangement is considered non cancelable and the related software licensing revenue is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements 
these elements may include one or more of the following software licenses  maintenance and support  consulting services and training 
we first allocate the arrangement fee  in a multiple element transaction  to the undelivered elements based on the total fair value of those undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence 
this portion of the arrangement fee is deferred 
then the difference residual between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we attribute the discount offered in a multiple element arrangement entirely to the delivered elements of the transaction  which are typically software licenses 
fair values for the future maintenance and support services are based upon substantially similar sales of renewals of maintenance and support contracts to other customers 
fair value of future services  training or consulting services is based upon substantially similar sales of these services to other customers 
in some instances  a group of contracts or agreements with the same customer may be so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single multiple element arrangement  and therefore  we would undertake to allocate the corresponding revenues amongst the various components  as described above 
we generally do not engage in non monetary transactions 
however  for arrangements involving non monetary exchanges the company accounts for them in accordance with sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
in  we were involved in a non monetary transaction with a customer  however  we established that a clear business purpose for the transaction existed and we were reasonably able to assign fair value to the consideration 
therefore  we concluded that it was appropriate to recognize revenue for the value of the product and services provided and record the associated expense for the products and services received 
this non monetary transaction of thousand accounted for less than of total revenue for we also eliminate intercompany profits on revenue transactions with unconsolidated subsidiaries that are accounted for under the equity method to the extent of our ownership interest in that related party  if the product and or services have not been sold through to an unrelated third party end user customer 

table of contents our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
when the customization is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the software license and consulting services revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which requires revenue to be recognized based upon the percentage of work effort completed on the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain doubtful accounts allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including previous transactions with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
we also assess whether collection is reasonably assured 
if any portion of a fee is due after days from the invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
we base our ongoing estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on the aging of the balances in the accounts receivable  our historical collection patterns and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of not collecting a specific account receivable becomes probable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the best information available to us and is re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we exhaust all avenues and methods of collection  including the use of third party collection agencies  before writing off a customer balance as uncollectible 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
each circumstance in which we conclude that a provision for non payment by a customer may be required must be carefully considered in order to determine the true factors leading to that potential non payment to ensure that it is proper for it to be categorized as an allowance for bad debts 
we have focused on improving our accounts receivable aging and  as a result  have been able to reduce our corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts in in the process 
however  a significant change in the financial condition of a major customer could have a material impact on our estimates regarding the sufficiency of our allowance 
our accounts receivable include material balances from a limited number of customers  with five customers accounting for of gross accounts receivable at december   compared to of gross accounts receivable at december  one customer accounted for or more of net accounts receivable at december   at 
for more information on our customer concentration  see our related discussion in risk factors certain factors that may affect our business 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying this assessment or changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  and the timing of information related to the change in financial condition could result in a different assessment of the existing credit risk of our accounts receivable and thus  a different required allowance  which could have a material impact on our reported earnings 
during  we reached a settlement agreement on a significant and long outstanding receivable related to a license agreement executed in june this receivable had been completely provided for in fiscal  because it was our determination then that the likelihood of default was probable  despite the fact that we had undertaken all avenues of collection available to us  including litigation 
as part of the process of pursuing collection through the court system  we entered into settlement discussions with the customer 
as a result of these discussions  a settlement was reached under which full payment of the original invoiced amount of million was assured upon execution of a new agreement 
in total  we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million due to the settlement 
as part of this settlement agreement  we also agreed to provide this customer with additional software products and professional services  the related costs of which were provided for from the allowance that had previously been set up against the receivable 
the remaining allowance in the amount of million was reversed against sales and marketing expenses as a recovery of this bad debt 

table of contents in a separate matter  during  the company collected thousand that had been outstanding over days and had previously been fully reserved 
the balance of thousand was reversed against sales and marketing expense as a recovery of bad debt during the year 
in  the company collected thousand that had been outstanding over days and had previously been fully reserved 
the balance of thousand was reversed against sales and marketing expense as a recovery of bad debt during the year 
restructuring charges and adjustments june restructuring plan on june   we announced that our board of directors had approved a restructuring plan to refocus on the most significant market opportunities and to reduce operating costs due to the macroeconomic factors that were negatively affecting technology investment in the market 
the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the restructuring plan and the impact of macroeconomic conditions on us and our global base of customers  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the second quarter of  with a subsequent reduction of million in the first half of in the second quarter of  we made a further adjustment to increase the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to the june restructuring plan by million to reflect a change in our projected sublet lease recoveries for our santa clara  california facility 
we concluded that this was required as a result of our realization that the market for leased facilities in that region will not recover in the timeframe that we had estimated  as evidenced by significantly lower projected sublease rates for our facility as supplied to us by our external real estate advisors 
we also recorded a million reduction to our june restructuring accrual in the third quarter of  as a result of the july settlement of an existing contractual obligation under a marketing and distribution agreement  at a value significantly less than the full accrued obligation 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the original accrued restructuring charges of million at june   including estimating future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  liabilities from employee severances  and costs to exit business activities 
changes in these assessments with respect to the accrued restructuring charges for the june restructuring program  particularly the estimation of sublease income for restructured facilities  of million at december   could have a material effect on our reported results  as actual results could vary from these assumptions and estimates 
as at december   we estimated a total of million of sublease recoveries in our restructuring accrual 
of this amount  million is related to the santa clara facility 
in addition  million of the million is recoverable under existing sublease agreements  and the remaining million of rent recoveries is based on estimates which may be subject to adjustment based upon changes in the real estate sublet markets 
the existing santa clara sublease expires during november the restructuring plan announced on june  was completed by june no further charges are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 
may restructuring plan on may   we announced a restructuring plan aimed at lowering costs and better aligning our resources to customer needs 
the plan allows us to have tighter integration between the groups in our organization that interact with customers  which better positions us to take advantage of the market opportunities for our new products 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of employee positions to lower operating costs  closing of under utilized office space  and re assessing the value of related excess long lived assets 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the restructuring charges of million  including estimating liabilities related to employee severance  future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  and other costs to exit activities 
changes in these assessments with respect to the accrued restructuring charges for 
table of contents the may restructuring plan of million at december  could have a material effect on our reported results 
in addition  actual results could vary from these assumptions and estimates  in particular with regard to the sublet of excess facilities  resulting in an adjustment that could have a material effect on our future financial results 
our accrual related to the may restructuring at december  includes a total of million of estimated sublease recoveries  which may be subject to adjustment based upon changes in the real estate sublet markets 
the restructuring plan announced on may  was completed by december  no further changes are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 
accounting for long term strategic investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of strategic investments on an on going basis  but at least annually 
factors that we consider important in determining whether an assessment is warranted and could trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the company in which we invested would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the company s operating performance or business model and changes in overall market conditions 
these investments are in private companies  made in and  of which we typically own less than of the outstanding stock 
we account for these investments under the cost method 
because there is not a liquid market for these securities  we often must make estimates of the value of our investments 
since  we have recorded a total of million of impairment charges with respect to these long term strategic investments due to other than temporary declines in the value of these strategic investments 
these impairments were related to our investments in several different companies 
as a result  we have no balance recorded related to the investments made in and  as of december  as a result of the rescission agreement discussed in the next section  as of december   we hold an investment in ohana  in the amount of thousand  representing approximately of the issued common shares of ohana 
this investment is now accounted for under the cost method 
we have recorded cumulative losses from our investment in ohana of thousand since the fourth quarter of as of march   we do not believe that there has been any further impairment of our investment in ohana 
accounting for equity investments we have million of investments as of december  that we account for under the equity basis of accounting  which represent our equity ownership in asia digital media 
asia digital media is a joint venture  involving us and several other investors  formed for the purpose of delivering secure technology solutions enabling hdtv satellite broadcasting  high speed internet and on line transaction services to the chinese market 
our investment in asia digital media began as a loan to ohana of thousand in  which was convertible into equity of ohana 
in the second quarter of this was increased to thousand 
in july  this loan was further increased to million 
this amount was further increased to million in the fourth quarter of we determined that the loan was unlikely to be repaid but rather expected it to be converted into equity in adml holdings  ltd 
adml holdco  once ohana became a wholly owned subsidiary of adml holdco in connection with the ohana restructuring 
on an as converted basis at september   we would have owned approximately of adml holdco exclusive of the anticipated final disbursement in the fourth quarter of 
beginning the third quarter of  we had accounted for our investment in ohana under the equity method  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we included our share of post acquisition losses of ohana  prior to the ohana restructuring  in the amount of thousand in our consolidated net income for the fiscal year 
the ohana restructuring closed on november  and we received approximately of the issued common shares of adml holdco  together with a warrant that may become exercisable for additional shares of adml holdco upon the happening of certain events 

table of contents on september   the company and certain other investors agreed to subscribe for shares in a newly formed joint venture called asia digital media pursuant to a subscription agreement as amended  the subscription agreement 
the investment closed on december  we directly subscribed for approximately of the share capital of asia digital media in exchange for a cash contribution of million and in kind contributions of software products and professional services totaling million 
of this amount  million was recorded on account of the in kind contributions as revenue in the fourth quarter of  net of intercompany profit eliminations 
also  adml holdco  in which we held an approximate ownership interest for our million investment  directly subscribed for of the share capital of asia digital media in exchange for a contribution of the entire issued share capital of ohana 
the remaining capital stock of asia digital media is owned by two investors and china aerospace new world technology limited  a company incorporated in hong kong 
during the first quarter of  we received additional shares of common stock of asia digital media in reimbursement for legal costs incurred by us on behalf of asia digital media during its formation and for administrative services that we provided 
these additional shares were valued at thousand and resulted in an increase of our total direct and indirect equity holdings in asia digital media to as of september  on december   we entered into the rescission agreement with asia digital media and adml holdco to rescind the subscription agreement in part  resulting in the return of the shares of asia digital media issued to adml holdco for cancellation and the corresponding return of the entire issued capital of ohana to adml holdco 
upon conclusion of the rescission agreement  the company will own approximately of the issued share capital of asia digital media and approximately of the issued share capital of ohana 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  we have accounted for our investment in asia digital media under the equity method 
accordingly  we have included our share of post acquisition losses of asia digital media  in the amount of thousand in our consolidated net income since the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
based on our assessment and our understanding of the facts  we have concluded that asia digital media does not meet the definition of a variable interest entity  as described in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

as the company began initial operations in december  engaging primarily in research and development  and having no revenue  we determined that asia digital media is a development stage enterprise 
furthermore  the capitalization of asia digital media anticipates raising additional equity to fund the scaled production pilot and commercial roll out 
however  the cash invested in asia digital media by investors of million  is expected to be sufficient equity to fund the initial development stage  which is defined as implementation of a pilot system with all specified functions in a limited commercial environment 
in addition  we determined that each shareholder of asia digital media shares in the risk of loss and that the shareholders  as a group  share the returns 
finally  we concluded that asia digital media does not operate substantively on behalf of one entity that receives a disproportionately fewer voting rights to avoid consolidation 
as of december   asia digital media has built  integrated  tested and demonstrated the end to end solution within a lab environment 
in october  asia digital media put its first real subscribers into a live network as part of the alpha trial 
asia digital media is currently working directly with cable operators and end users to refine its products for the market 
asia digital media remains an important joint venture with an opportunity to address both the aip opportunity for secure distribution of digital content in china and to address the growing market for security software products in china 
as of march   we do not believe that there has been any impairment of our investment in asia digital media 
provision for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states 
in addition  we have based the calculation of our income taxes in each jurisdiction upon inter company agreements  which could be challenged 
table of contents by tax authorities in these jurisdictions 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure in each jurisdiction together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue and accrued restructuring charges  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   which offsets deferred income tax assets relating to united states and foreign net operating loss nol and tax credit carry forwards in the amount of million and million of deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
this valuation allowance represents the full value of our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets as a result of our recent history of financial losses 
therefore  our balance sheet includes no net deferred tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the timing of the temporary differences becoming deductible 
we consider  among other available information  historical earnings  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and other matters in making this assessment 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to contribute to our success by attracting  retaining and motivating talented employees and to align employee interests with the interests of our existing stockholders 
stock options may be granted to employees when they first join us  when there is a significant change in an employee s responsibilities and  occasionally  to achieve equity within a peer group 
stock options may also be granted in specific circumstances for retention or reward purposes 
the compensation committee of the board of directors may  however  grant additional options to executive officers and key employees for other reasons 
under the stock option plans  the participants may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock and substantially all of our employees and directors participate in at least one of our plans 
options issued under these plans generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant  become exercisable at varying rates  generally over three or four years 
options issued before april   generally expire ten years from the date of grant  options issued on or after april   generally expire seven years from the date of grant 
we recognize that stock options dilute existing shareholders and have attempted to control the number of options granted while remaining competitive with our compensation packages 
at december   approximately of our outstanding stock options carried exercise prices in excess of the closing market price of our common stock on that day 
the compensation committee of the board of directors oversees the granting of all stock based incentive awards 
we account for our stock option plans under the recognition and intrinsic value measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related accounting guidance 
accordingly  no stock based compensation expense is reflected in net income loss for grants to employees under these plans  when the exercise price for options granted under these plans is equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
all of the options granted to employees in the periods after had exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant and  therefore  no stock based compensation costs are reflected in earnings for these options in these periods 
if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based compensation  the effect would have been to create a net loss for of 
table of contents million  compared to a net loss of million and million for and  respectively  and consequently  we would have reported a net loss per share of for  compared to a net loss per share of and for and  respectively 
however  we believe  that due to the volatility of our stock and the inherent limitations of option valuation models  the expenses that would be recorded under sfas no 
are not as meaningful as a careful consideration of the outstanding option data  which is disclosed in note n to our consolidated financial statements  included in this report 
as an illustration  because of significant movement in the market value of our stock price since september   the percentage of total options outstanding that were considered to be in the money options with exercise prices at or below the closing market price per share went from at september  down to at november  in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
and requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  and recognize that cost over the service period 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first annual period beginning after june  and  therefore  we will begin recognizing compensation expense related to employee stock options as of january  in january  our board of directors approved accelerating the vesting of all of the outstanding unvested stock options granted to our directors  officers and employees under applicable stock incentive plans  with an exercise price greater than 
as a result of the acceleration  options to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock  which otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next four years  became immediately exercisable 
all other terms and conditions applicable to outstanding stock option grants remain in effect 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of affected stock options was primarily based upon the issuance of sfas no 
r 
in addition  because these options have exercise prices in excess of current market values and are not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention  the acceleration may have a positive effect on employee morale and retention 
by accelerating the vesting of the affected stock options  we were not required to record any amount of compensation expense for such accelerated stock options 
we believe that acceleration of these million stock options eliminated the need for recognizing future compensation expense of approximately million associated with the affected options 
however  there can be no assurance that the acceleration of the options may not result in some future compensation expense 
in addition  we decided to use restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in future incentive compensation plans for employees and members of the board of directors  in place of or in combination with stock options to purchase shares of our stock 
in the second quarter of  we granted  restricted stock units rsu s to employees  which allow the employees to receive common stock of the company once the units vest 
since the second quarter of  an additional  rsu s have been issued and  were cancelled 
the rsu s generally vest over four years 
the company recorded unearned deferred compensation of million related to these grants in also  we granted a total of  stock appreciation rights to the members of our board of directors  valued at per right on may   which was the date of grant 
of this amount   were subsequently cancelled due to a departure from the board of directors 
these sar s are accounted for as variable equity compensation awards  and as such  the value of these instruments is revalued each period

we also generate revenues from consulting  training and post contract support  or maintenance  performed for customers who license our products 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized as revenue when we have received a copy of an executed license agreement or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  the software has been shipped if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is probable  the fees are fixed and determinable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as 
table of contents subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
this policy is applicable to all sales transactions  including sales to resellers and end user customers 
we are notified of a sale by a reseller to the end user customer in the same period that the actual sale took place 
we do not offer a right of return on sales of our software products 
for arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements 
these elements may include one or more of the following software licenses  maintenance and support  consulting services and training 
we first allocate the arrangement fee  in a multiple element transaction  to the undelivered elements based on the total fair value of those undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence 
this portion of the arrangement fee is deferred 
then the difference residual between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we attribute the discount offered in a multiple element arrangement entirely to the delivered elements of the transaction  which are typically software licenses 
fair values for the future maintenance and support services are based upon substantially similar sales of renewals of maintenance and support contracts to other customers 
fair value of future services  training or consulting services is based upon substantially similar sales of these services to other customers 
in some instances  a group of contracts or agreements with the same customer may be so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single multiple element arrangement  and therefore  we would undertake to allocate the corresponding revenues amongst the various components  as described above 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
if maintenance services are included free of charge or discounted in a license agreement  such amounts are unbundled from the license fee at their fair market value based upon the value established by independent sales of such maintenance services to other customers 
revenues from the sale of web server certificates are also recognized ratably over the term of the certificate  which is typically one to two years 
consulting and training revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services are typically performed under separate service agreements and are usually performed on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation and deployment of our products and do not include significant customization or development of the underlying software code 
we use the percentage of completion method to account for fixed price custom development contracts 
under this method  we recognize revenue and profit as the work on the contract progresses 
revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of the total cost incurred to date divided by the total estimated contract cost to the total contract value  and any projected loss is recognized immediately 
the project cost estimates are reviewed on a regular basis 
we eliminate intercompany profits on revenue transactions with unconsolidated subsidiaries that are accounted for under the equity method to the extent of our ownership interest in that related party  if the product and or services have not been sold through to an unrelated third party end user customer

table of contents extended government revenues in the united states also grew to million in  representing a increase over we believe the significant increase in revenues outside of north america from to  reflects the strength of our evolving product portfolio  distribution network  strong customer relationships and the quality of our support and services 
the overall increase in total revenues from to was driven primarily by an improved closure rate for software deals in the fourth quarter of  particularly in north america 
the improvement in north america was experienced mainly in the enterprise market  while extended government revenues in the united states also grew to million in  representing a increase over however  we continued to see softness in the international market  resulting in a decline in revenues generated from outside north america from to in  a single customer accounted for or more of revenues  while no other customers accounted for or more of revenues 
in only one customer accounted for or more of revenue  while in no individual customer accounted for or more of revenues 
the united states and canadian governments represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively  when including revenues sold through resellers to the government end users

new products continued to gain traction in  with revenue from our target areas of identityguard  secure gateway messaging and device certificates accounting for over of total product revenue  which underpinned our total product revenue growth of  particularly outside of north america 
the decrease in product revenues in absolute dollars in primarily reflected the changed buying patterns that we experienced during this period  with customers delaying purchases as a result of the soft economic climate internationally and concerns over the war in iraq 
our product revenue transactions a product revenue transaction is defined as a product sale in excess of thousand grew to in  up from in  or a increase  which in turn was down from product revenue transactions in  or a decrease of 
we also grew our new customer count by in compared to the prior year 
the average product revenue transaction size decreased from thousand in to thousand in  or a decrease of  after the average product revenue transaction size increased from thousand in in general  the top five average quarterly product revenue transactions as a percentage of total revenues declined from and in and  respectively to in this decrease in average product revenue transaction size and the decline in the top five average product revenue transactions are consistent with our expectations  due to the increased level of product transactions and improved volume of transactions involving new customers and new products 
product revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased in compared to due to a stronger demand for products  relative to the demand for services 
product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased in compared to due to a stronger demand for services  primarily maintenance and support services  relative to the demand for software  reflecting the shift from new project software spending to service driven deployment and maintenance 
services and maintenance revenues 
services and maintenance revenues of million in represented an increase of from the million in  which in turn  represented an increase of from the million in these revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the improved revenue for was primarily due to a million growth in support and maintenance revenues when compared to  primarily due to the addition of entrust japan in late we believe this support revenue performance reflects the value our products provide to our customers globally  the increasing customer deployment of solutions and the level of service quality that our support and maintenance team delivers 
in addition  to a greater degree  we have been fulfilling our customers deployment needs in and in conjunction with partners  as our solutions are now easier to deploy and consequently  we have seen an increase in services revenue over the past year driven by increased third party services and hardware revenue globally 
the improved revenues in compared to were driven by increased professional services revenues of million  primarily due to a million growth in revenues in our entrust cygnacom division  and 
table of contents support and maintenance revenues  and related support contract renewals  which grew million for when compared to partly due to the acquisition of entrust japan during the third quarter of the decrease in services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to reflected the shift in the mix of revenues from services and maintenance revenues to product  largely due to the strength of demand for our products offerings relative to the demand for services and maintenance business 
the increase in services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to reflected the strength of demand for our services and maintenance business relative to the demand for software  with product revenues declining year over year from to while services and maintenance revenues improved by 
total expenses 
total expenses consist of costs of revenues associated with products and services and maintenance  amortization of purchased products rights and operating expenses associated with sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  impairment of purchased products rights and restructuring charges 
total expenses of million in represented an increase of from million in this increase from to was due primarily to the impact of royalties for third party technology that is embedded in our solutions of million  incremental cost of million in related to the acquisition of entrust japan in september and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million principally between the united states and canadian dollars 
however  offsetting these expense increases was headcount reductions from to in addition  benefited from the recovery of bad debts in the amount of million related to the collection of a long outstanding receivable 
as of december   we had full time employees globally  compared to full time employees at december  cost of revenues cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of costs associated with product media  documentation  packaging and royalties to third party software vendors 
cost of product revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues for the respective years 
while the cost of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent year over year from through  the increase in cost of product revenues in absolute dollars in from was primarily due to the product mix  which included more third party products and therefore increased royalties 
the decrease in cost of product revenues in absolute dollars in from was primarily due to improved efficiencies in our web server certificate business which led to savings of million in and decreases in third party royalties paid on older products of million 
the mix of third party products and the relative gross margins achieved with respect to these products may vary from period to period and from transaction to transaction and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
cost of services and maintenance revenues 
cost of services and maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training and consulting services  as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services 
cost of services and maintenance revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues for the respective years 
cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars for increased when compared to  due to the effect of increased costs associated with third party hardware and royalty maintenance fees of million 
also  we increased our investment in our support and maintenance and professional services teams by million in principally due to the acquisition of entrust japan in september the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to is primarily due to improved overall revenues  resulting in a three percentage point decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
this was offset by the shift in the mix of services and maintenance revenues toward third party services and hardware  which are lower margin revenues  and increased spending on entrust japan service teams 

table of contents cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars for decreased when compared to  due to the net effect of decreased costs associated with operating efficiencies and with our may restructuring  which together resulted in a million reduction in the cost structure of our professional services team  despite improved revenue performance  offset by increased investment in our support and maintenance team and our entrust cygnacom services team of million in the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was largely due to the fact that we were able to grow services and maintenance revenues while not increasing our overall services and maintenance cost in and  in fact  decreasing these expenses in when compared to the prior year  through improved utilization of existing resources 
the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in decreased percentage points due to this effect  compared to the same period of the previous year 
however  this effect was partially offset by the lower product revenue performance in compared to services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues was in  in and in the decrease in services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues for  compared to  was primarily due to the net impact of declined north american professional services margins as a result of lower utilization of available professional services resources and a greater volume of lower margin third party services and hardware revenues  meaning higher relative costs associated with professional services in light of this revenue performance 
this accounted for a two percentage point decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues for  when compared to however  support and maintenance margins improved due to higher revenues from strong past renewals in  which resulted in an offsetting one percentage point increase in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues in when compared to  despite the increased investment in this team 
the increase in services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues for  compared to  was primarily due to improved professional services revenues and operating efficiencies achieved in the form of higher productivity and utilization of available professional services resources  particularly in north america  meaning lower relative costs associated with professional services in light of these improved revenues  which resulted in higher margin attainment by our professional services team 
these increases in professional services revenues accounted for a seven percentage point increase in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues for  when compared to however  support and maintenance margins declined for due to the significant investment made in this team early in to ensure continued quality of service and the unfavorable impact of the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollar  which resulted in an offsetting two percentage point decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues  compared to the previous year 
we plan to continue to optimize the utilization of existing professional services resources  while addressing significant incremental customer opportunities that may arise in the near future with the help of partners and other sub contractors  until the investment in additional full time resources is justifiable 
this may have an adverse impact on the gross profit for services and maintenance  as the gross profit realized by using partners and sub contractors is generally lower 
the mix of services and maintenance revenues may vary from period to period and from transaction to transaction and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
operating expenses operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the increase in absolute dollars for  when compared to  was due mainly to reduced costs in as a result of the collection of long outstanding receivables during  which netted an approximate million in recoveries and was recorded as a reduction in selling and marketing expenses in also  the acquisition of entrust japan in late  
table of contents resulted in an increase in expenses of million in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in from was mainly due to the continued management discipline with respect to spending  savings achieved as a result of our may restructuring and corresponding reduction in headcount and marketing programs  which resulted in savings of million  and the collection of two long outstanding receivables  which netted an approximate million reduction in selling and marketing expenses in  as a result of the corresponding reduction in the provision for aged receivables 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for was consistent with this was a result of the net effect of increased expenses being offset by increased revenues compared to the effect of increased expenses related to bad debt recoveries in and incremental entrust japan expenses in was an increase of two percentage points in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
this effect was offset by a two percentage point decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues due to improved revenue achievement in compared to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for  compared to  reflected the effect of cost savings realized through our may restructuring and reduced spending through efficiencies and discipline implemented in our sales processes  which decreased sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues by eight percentage  and a two percentage point decrease due to the bad debt recovery 
in addition  these savings were complemented by a one percentage point decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for  due to improved revenue achievement compared to we intend to continue to focus on improving the productivity of these sales and marketing teams 
however  we believe it is necessary for us to continue to make significant investments in sales and marketing to support the launch of new products  services and marketing programs by maintaining our strategy of a investing in hiring and training our sales force in anticipation of future market growth  and b investing in marketing efforts in support of new product launches 
we feel it is necessary to invest in marketing programs that will improve the awareness and understanding of information security governance  and we will continue to invest in marketing toward that goal 
failure to make such investments could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
while we are focused on marketing programs and revenue generating opportunities to increase software revenues  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will be successful 
during  the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from million to million primarily as a result of a reduction in the allowance because of the improvement in our accounts receivable aging in  principally due to collection of a long outstanding receivable  which had been fully provided for in fiscal during  the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased million to million primarily as a result of a reduction in the allowance because of the significant improvement in our accounts receivable aging in and collection of two long outstanding receivables 
we recorded a net bad debt recovery of million in the first quarter of  after providing for the settlement costs related to the recovered bad debt and recording a provision for other aged receivables 
in addition  the allowance was reduced for a second bad debt recovery during of million 
during  the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million to million  with the increase being recorded as a bad debt expense in the second quarter of the increase related to one particular customer receivable balance  and was not indicative of an overall decline in the quality of our accounts receivable 
generally  we experienced effective cash collections throughout  and operating expenses research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in research and development expenses for  compared to  was due mainly to continued management discipline in this area  with reduced spending for of approximately million  offset by the unfavorable shift in the exchange rate between canada and the us for the period that increased reported expenses by million 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for decreased compared to  primarily due to a two percentage point decrease as a result of reduced spending  offset by a one percentage point increase due the unfavorable shift in exchange rates in in addition  the improved revenues in accounted for a one percentage point decrease in these expenses as a percentage of total revenues 

table of contents the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars for  compared to  was mainly due to the continued management discipline in spending and savings achieved as a result of our may restructuring  which reduced expenses in this area by approximately million in  despite an increase in the cost base due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations between canada and the united states 
this decrease for was partially offset by increased compensation costs associated with our corporate bonus plan of approximately million 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for decreased compared to  mainly due to a six percentage point decrease in spending in this area  as a result of the may restructuring 
this effect was augmented by the improved revenue in  which accounted for a one percentage point decrease in these expenses as a percentage of total revenues in compared to we believe that we must continue to maintain our investment in research and development in order to protect our technological leadership position  software quality and security assurance leadership 
we therefore expect that research and development expenses may have to increase in the future 
operating expenses general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decline in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for compared to was due to the effect of continued management discipline in this area  with net savings of million  despite increased expenses of million from related to the inclusion of a full year of entrust japan expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased in compared to this is due to the net reduction in spending and improved revenue achievement during the net reduction in spending resulted in a one percentage point decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from to  while the increase in total revenues resulted in an additional decrease of one percentage point  as these expenses include a high degree of fixed costs 
the decline in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in compared to was due to net effect of continued management discipline in this area  with savings of million in  and the implementation of our restructuring plan in may  which resulted in reduced spending of million for  offset by increased costs associated with entrust japan of million in the second half of and increased compensation costs associated with the corporate bonus plan of million recorded in the first quarter of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues for was consistent with  largely due to the reduced spending that resulted from our may restructuring  which translated into a two percentage point decrease  which was offset by a one percentage point increase due to the increased costs related to the bonus plan in the first quarter of and entrust japan in the last half of we continue to explore opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in our administrative processes and to contain expenses in these functional areas 
amortization of purchased product rights and impairment of purchased product rights amortization of purchased product rights was thousand and thousand for and  respectively  related to the acquisition of certain business assets from amikanow during this expense was recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
as a result of actions undertaken in the restructuring in the second quarter of  coupled with the commercial release of a next generation software product  we reviewed the estimated future cash flows from the developed technology acquired in from encommerce  inc encommerce 
based on these events  the net present value of the estimated future cash flows from the purchased product rights is negative 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter of related to this asset in the amount of the remaining carrying value of million  as we determined the asset had minimal fair value 
amortization of purchased product rights in connection with the encommerce acquisition was thousand in this expense was recorded as a component of cost of revenues in that year 

table of contents restructuring charges and adjustments may restructuring plan following the first quarter of  when our revenues fell short of our expectations  we began a re assessment of our operations to ensure that our expenses were optimally aligned to our customers and markets  and structured such that we could achieve our financial break even target for the fourth quarter of on may   we announced a restructuring plan aimed at lowering costs and better aligning our resources to customer needs 
the plan allows us to have tighter integration between the groups in our organization that interact with customers  which better positions us to take advantage of the market opportunities for our new products 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of employee positions through layoffs and attrition to lower operating costs  the closing of under utilized office space and reassessing the useful life of related excess long lived assets  and review of the realizability of developed technology impacted by the restructuring 
the workforce portion included severance and related costs of million for positions from all functional areas and had been completed by december  the consolidation of under utilized facilities included costs relating to lease obligations through the first quarter of primarily from excess space in our santa clara  california and addison  texas facilities  and accelerated amortization of related leaseholds and equipment 
the facilities plan was executed by september  and  as a result  we recorded million of charges during relating to these facilities  including million for accelerated amortization on leaseholds and equipment whose estimated useful lives had been impacted by the plan to cease using the related excess space in our facilities 
the total amount of the workforce and facilities charges was million  and charged to the restructuring charges line in the consolidated statement of operations in the restructuring resulted in a reduction of all expense lines including total cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
as a result of the implementation of the restructuring plan  our total expenses operating expenses plus cost of revenues were million in the fourth quarter of  a reduction of million from the million incurred during the second quarter of june restructuring plan in july  we signed a settlement and general release agreement with zix corporation  that resulted in the remaining contractual obligation under the company s marketing and distribution agreement with zix corporation being settled at a value significantly less than the accrued million obligation at june  under the settlement agreement  we paid zix corporation thousand in july in fulfillment of all remaining obligations 
this settlement resulted in the reversal of an accrual by us of million  which was recorded through the restructuring charges line in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the third quarter of in connection with the may restructuring plan  which included a further reduction in space utilized at our santa clara  california facility  we reviewed market sublease rates in that region 
based on information supplied to us by our external real estate advisors  we concluded that the sublease market would not recover in the timeframe that we had originally estimated due to the continued softening of sublease rates in that market  requiring an adjustment to increase the facility related accrual recorded in june by million 
this adjustment was charged to the restructuring charges line in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the second quarter of no further adjustments were required in and the restructuring plan announced on june  was completed by june no further charges are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 

table of contents write down of long term strategic investments we recorded a non cash charge in related to the impairment of a long term strategic investment made in brazil in fiscal due to a decline in market conditions and a restructuring of the investee by its management  we concluded that the investment had suffered an other than temporary decline in fair value as determined by third party market transactions  and as such  we recorded an impairment in the second quarter of of million 
interest income interest income increased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the increase in investment income from through reflected improved interest rates on funds invested  despite the reduced balance of funds invested as a result of amounts drawn down to fund cash flow from operations and stock repurchases and to acquire long lived assets during the period 
the funds invested decreased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  however  the rate of return on our marketable investments improved to approximately for compared to approximately for and gain on sale of asset we recorded a gain on the sale of unused intellectual property assets during in the amount of thousand 
this type of sale is not expected to be a recurring event 
loss from equity investments we recorded thousand and thousand of losses  net of intercompany profit eliminations  related to our investment in asia digital media in and  respectively 
we began accounting for this investment under the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of  since we had the potential to significantly influence its operations and management 
in addition  we recorded thousand of losses related to our investment in ohana in  prior to the ohana restructuring 
we recorded thousand of losses related to our investment in entrust japan for  compared to thousand for these losses represented our share of the operating losses of entrust japan on an equity accounting basis 
our investment in entrust japan was accounted for under the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock until the acquisition on september  when we increased our investment from to of the outstanding voting stock in entrust japan 
since september   we have consolidated the financial results of entrust japan in our financial statements 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of thousand in  compared to thousand in and thousand in these provisions represent primarily the taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rates differed from statutory rates primarily due to the impairment of long term strategic investments and purchased product rights  foreign research and development tax credits  as well as an adjustment of the valuation allowance that has offset the tax benefits from the significant net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available 

table of contents quarterly results of operations our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  our period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the completion date of large license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of our products often requires a significant capital investment  which customers may view as a discretionary cost and  therefore  a purchase that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  therefore  we do not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues are heavily dependent upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we have generally recorded a significant portion of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we expect these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  quarterly license revenues are dependent on the timing of revenue recognition  which can be affected by many factors  including the timing of customer installations and acceptance 
in these regards  we have from time to time experienced delays in recognizing revenues with respect to certain orders 
in any period a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
despite the uncertainties in our revenue patterns  our operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout the quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are delayed or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected in a significant way

our average days sales outstanding at december  was days  which represents an increase from the days that we reported at december  the overall increase in days sales outstanding from december  was mainly due to significantly better in quarter collections during the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter of and a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from the previous year 
for purposes of calculating average days sales outstanding  we divide ending accounts receivable by the applicable quarter s revenues and multiply this amount by days 
the level of accounts receivable at each quarter end is affected by the concentration of revenues in the final weeks of each quarter and may be negatively affected by expanded international revenues in relation to total revenues as licenses to international customers often have longer payment terms 

table of contents any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and days sales outstanding will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the timing of when sales are invoiced and length of customer s payment cycle 
generally  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers  so that an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our days sales outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
we have observed an increase in the length of our customers payment cycles  which may result in higher accounts receivable balances  and could expose us to greater general credit risks with our customers and increased bad debt expense 
during  we generated million of cash from investing activities  primarily due to cash provided by net reductions in our marketable investments in the amount of million and from the proceeds on the one time sale of intellectual property assets of million 
this was partially offset by the investment of million in property and equipment  primarily for computer hardware upgrades throughout our organization  million in the asia digital media equity investment and million in other long term assets related to capitalized software development costs 
we used cash of million for financing activities in during that year  we used million in cash for the repurchase of our common stock and million to repay long term liabilities  offset by million in cash provided by the exercise of employee stock options 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in the amount of million provided our principal sources of liquidity 
overall  we used million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments during although we continue to target operating profitability  based on sustaining current revenue and operating expense structures  we estimate that we may continue to use cash in fiscal to satisfy the obligations provided for under our restructuring program 
however  if operating losses do occur  then cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be negatively affected 
on july   we announced that our board of directors had authorized us to repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the program has subsequently been extended three times  most recently on july  when the board of directors authorized a further extension of this stock repurchase program to permit the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock through december  this quantity of common shares is in addition to the  shares of our common stock already purchased under the stock repurchase program through june  during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total cash outlay of million at an average price of  including commissions paid to brokers 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program since its inception  for a total cash outlay of million at an average price of per share  including commissions paid to brokers 
while there can be no assurance as to the extent of usage of liquid resources in future periods  we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
in terms of long term liquidity requirements  we will need to fund the million of accrued restructuring charges at december  through fiscal  as detailed below 
this amount is net of estimated sublet recoveries on restructured facilities of million 
the lease obligations included in these accrued restructuring charges are disclosed in the table of contractual commitments below 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million per year on capital expenditures  primarily for computer equipment needed to replace existing equipment that is coming to the end of its useful life 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  as well as future operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund these long term requirements 

table of contents we have commitments that will expire at various times through we lease administrative and sales offices and certain property and equipment under non cancelable operating leases that will expire in a summary of our contractual commitments at december  is as follows as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations currently utilized facilities operating lease obligations restructured facilities guaranteed payments to amikanow total in addition to the lease commitments included above  we have provided letters of credit totaling million as security deposits in connection with certain office leases 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into standard indemnification agreements with our business partners and customers 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to modify  repair or replace the product  pay royalties for a right to use  defend and reimburse the indemnified party for actual damages awarded by a court against the indemnified party for an intellectual property infringement claim by a third party with respect to our products and services  and indemnify for property damage that may be caused in connection with consulting services performed at a customer site by our employees or our subcontractors 
the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
we have general and umbrella insurance policies that generally enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we generally warrant for ninety days from delivery to a customer that our software products will perform free from material errors that prevent performance in accordance with user documentation 
additionally  we warrant that our consulting services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards including other warranties 
we have only incurred nominal expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of our obligations under these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we have entered into employment and executive retention agreements with certain employees and executive officers  which  among other things  include certain severance and change of control provisions 
we have also entered into agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk associated with interest rates our investment policy states that we will invest our cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  in investments that are designed to preserve principal  maintain liquidity and maximize return 
we actively manage our investments in accordance with these objectives 
some of these investments are subject to interest rate risk  whereby a change in market interest rates will cause the principal amount of the underlying investment to fluctuate 
therefore  depreciation in principal value of an investment is possible in situations where the investment is made at a fixed interest rate and the market interest rate then subsequently increases 
the following table presents the cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments that we held at december  and  that would have been subject to interest rate risk  and the related ranges of maturities as of those dates december  december  maturity maturity within months months months months within months months months months in thousands investments classified as cash and cash equivalents investments classified as held to maturity marketable investments total amortized cost fair value we try to manage this risk by maintaining our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments with high quality financial institutions and investment managers 
as a result  we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is minimal 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair values of these instruments were determined by net present values 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
risk associated with exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  specifically between the united states and canada  the united kingdom  the european union and japan 
this exposure is not considered to be material with respect to the united kingdom  european and japanese operations due to the fact that these operations are not significant 
however  because a disproportionate amount of our expenses are denominated in canadian dollars  through the company s canadian operations  while our canadian denominated revenue streams are cyclical  we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the canadian dollar  and in particular  fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar 
therefore  a favorable change in the exchange rate for the canadian subsidiary would result in higher revenues when translated into us dollars  but would also mean expenses would be higher in a corresponding fashion and to a greater degree 
historically  we have not engaged in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses is minimized 
however  as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  our expense base increased by million in  when compared to  due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states and canadian dollars 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars  covering exposures on approximately million of our canadian subsidiary s expenses denominated in canadian dollars  in an attempt to reduce earnings volatility that might result from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollar 
none of the related foreign exchange contracts extended past december  similarly  we have engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars covering exposures on approximately million of expenses denominated in canadian dollars in the first quarter of risk associated with long term strategic investments we invested in several privately held companies in and for business and strategic alliance purposes  most of which are technology companies in the start up or development stage  or are companies with technologies and products that are targeted at geographically distant markets 
as a result of other than temporary declines in the net realizable value  these investments were fully impaired over the period from to accordingly  there is no net book value remaining for these strategic investments as of december  as a result of the rescission agreement discussed elsewhere in this annual report  as of december   we hold an investment in ohana  in the amount of thousand  representing approximately of the issued common shares of ohana 
this investment is now accounted for under the cost method 
ohana is in the start up or development stage  and may lack the financial resources  licenses  technology and governmental approvals necessary to import  develop or offer for sale any commercial product or service 
if the demand for ohana s products and services materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant market  we could lose all or substantially all of our investment 
we have recorded cumulative losses from our investment in ohana of thousand since the fourth quarter of however  as of march   the most recent date of assessment  we do not believe that there has been any further impairment of our investment in ohana 
risk associated with equity investments in total we have invested million in asia digital media  representing an equity interest of approximately in the issued common shares of asia digital media at december  asia digital media is a joint venture in the start up or development stage  and may lack the financial resources  licenses  technology and governmental approvals necessary to import  develop or offer for sale in china any commercial product or service 
as of december   asia digital media has built  integrated  tested  and demonstrated the end to end solution within a lab environment 
in october  asia digital media put its first real subscribers into a live network as part of the alpha trial 
asia digital media is currently working directly with cable operators and end users to refine its products for the market 
if no such offerings are developed due to insufficient financial resources  inability to license required third party intellectual property  technical problems  or a lack of necessary governmental approvals  we could lose all or substantially all of our investment 
in addition  if the demand for asia digital media s products and services materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant market  we could lose all or substantially all of our investment 
we have recorded cumulative losses from our investment in asia digital media of thousand since the investment in the fourth quarter of as of march   the most recent date of assessment  we do not believe that there has been any further impairment of our direct and indirect investments in asia digital media
