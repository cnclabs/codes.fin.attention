overview gasco is a natural gas and petroleum exploitation  development and production company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon prospects  primarily in the rocky mountain region 
the company s business strategy is to enhance shareholder value by using technologies new to a specific area to generate and develop high potential exploitation resources in this area 
the company s principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights  either directly or indirectly  and the exploitation and development of properties subject to those leases 
the company s corporate strategy is to grow through drilling projects 
the company has been focusing its drilling efforts in the riverbend project located in the uinta basin of northeastern utah 
the higher oil and gas prices during and due to factors such as inventory levels of gas in storage  extreme weather in parts of the country and increasing demand in the united states  combined with the continued instability in the middle east have increased the profitability of the company s drilling projects in this area 
the wells in the riverbend project tend to have multiple productive zones 
the increased drilling activity resulting from the higher oil and gas prices has decreased the availability of drilling rigs and experienced personnel in this area and may continue to do so in the future 
the company also continues to incur higher drilling and operating costs resulting from the increased fuel and steel costs and from the increased drilling activity in this area 
recent developments gasco increased its capital budget to million from million for drilling and completion operations and pipeline connections in the riverbend project area 
the increased budget included spudding two additional wells  initial completion operations on two wells  and increased costs associated with the company s drilling program 
during we spudded gross wells net and reached total depth on gross wells net 
initial completion operations were conducted on wells and well bores were re entered to complete behind pipe pay 
the company anticipates an overall increase in its compensation expense because it continues to hire additional personnel to manage the workload associated with its operational plans for during the company had three rigs operating in its riverbend project 
we converted two of the three rigs currently drilling for us from well to well contracts to two year term contracts 
the third rig will continue to operate on a well to well basis 
during december  gasco purchased a rig for approximately  gasco entered into a one year drilling contract with an unrelated third party who will operate the rig 
the operator may buy the rig from gasco at the fair market value of the rig within three years of when the rig is delivered 
this rig is scheduled to be moved on location in our riverbend project to begin drilling early in the second quarter of with the addition of this rig  gasco will have four rigs drilling in the riverbend project during most of also  during december  we entered into a three year contract for a new build rig to be delivered in december in connection with this contract we provided the rig owner a letter of credit from our bank for  the cash collateral for this letter of credit is reflected as a restricted investment in the accompanying financial statements 
on november   we closed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we also granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to  additional shares of our common stock solely to cover over allotments 
pursuant to this option  the underwriters purchased an additional  shares of common stock on december  the net proceeds from this offering  after underwriting discount and offering costs were  we expect to use these proceeds to fund capital expenditures for the development and exploration of our oil and natural gas properties and the development ofassociated infrastructure  working capital and general corporate purposes 
the board of directors of gasco approved a budget of million for our capital expenditure program 
the program will primarily cover the drilling and completion of approximately gross wells net wells on our riverbend project and the drilling and completion of up to three wells in wyoming 
the budget also includes expenditures for the installation of associated pipeline infrastructure  distribution facilities and geophysical operations 
in implementing our planned increase in drilling activity we have encountered difficulties in obtaining additional drilling supplies and services as well as experienced personnel  which may reduce the number of wells the company is able to drill during the company anticipates an overall increase in its salary expense because it will have to hire additional employees to manage the workload associated with its operational plan for management believes it has sufficient capital for its operational budget  but will need to raise additional capital for its capital budget in the company will consider several options for raising additional funds such as entering into a revolving line of credit  selling securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar type arrangements 
any financing obtained through the sale of gasco equity will likely result in substantial dilution to the company s stockholders

the majority of the revisions of previous estimates were a result of the following four locations previously classified as proved undeveloped were omitted from the reserve report because these locations required a higher capital investment than originally estimated due to drilling and completion problems and due to the lack of historical data related to recent completions and recompletions in this area 
six locations previously classified as proved undeveloped were omitted from the reserve report because recent drilling activity indicates that these locations may be outside of or on the edge of a previously identified zone 
two proved developed non producing completions significantly underperformed previous forecasts 
during  the company s oil and gas production increased by approximately as compared with primarily due to our drilling projects and working interest acquisitions 
during  on a combined basis  the oil and gas reserve quantities increased by approximately primarily due to reserve additions of and purchases of reserves of partially offset by production of  property sales of and revisions of previous estimates of 
the previous estimate revisions relate to the write down of the reserves related to two wells and their offset locations resulting from scale deposits in the wellbores 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s sources and uses of cash for each of the three years ended december   and for the year ended december  net cash provided by used in operations    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    net cash flow    the increase in cash provided by operations from to is primarily due to a increase in oil and gas production  a increase in gas prices and a increase in oil prices 
the production increase is due to the drilling activity during as described above 
the decrease in cash used in operations from to was primarily due to the increase in revenue resulting from a increase in oil and gas production due to the company s drilling activity and the acquisition of additional working interests in six wells during  partially offset by a decrease in the changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to the timing of the company s operational activity 
the company s investing activities during the three years ended december  related primarily to the company s development and exploration activities and the purchase of a drilling rig 
during  we also completed acquisitions of acreage and additional working interests in producing wells for approximately  we had sales proceeds of  during which represented the sale of acreage to an unrelated entity 
our sales proceeds during represented a disposition of net profits interests in wells in the riverbend area for  we also invested  in short term investments during and sold  of these investments during the remaining investing activity during  and consisted of changes in our restricted investments 
historically  the company has relied on the sale of equity capital and farm outs and other similar types of transactions to fund working capital  the acquisition of its prospects and its drilling and development activities 
the financing activities in each of the years presented is primarily comprised of the net proceeds from the sale of equity in the company  as further described below 
on november   we closed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we also granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to  additional shares of our common stock solely to cover over allotments 
pursuant to this option  the underwriters purchased an additional  shares of common stock on december  the net proceeds from this offering  after underwriting discount and offering costs were  we expect to use these proceeds to fund capital expenditures for the development and exploration of our oil and natural gas properties and the development of associated infrastructure  working capital and general corporate purposes

the program will primarily cover the drilling and completion of approximately gross wells net wells on our riverbend project and the drilling and completion of up to three wells in wyoming 
the budget also includes expenditures for the installation of associated pipeline infrastructure  distribution facilities and geophysical operations 
this budget will be funded primarily from cash on hand and the proceeds from our november stock offering described above 
management believes it has sufficient capital for its operational budget  but may need to raise additional capital for its capital budget in the company may consider several options for raising additional funds such as entering into a revolving line of credit  selling securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar type arrangements 
any financing obtained through the sale of gasco equity will likely result in substantial dilution to the company s stockholders 
schedule of contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under its notes payable  operating leases  employment contracts  consulting agreement and service contracts for the periods specified as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years convertible notes principal   interest      drilling rig contracts     operating lease office space     employment contracts    consulting agreements    total contractual cash obligations      the three year drilling contract for the new build rig contains a provision for the company to terminate the contract for  per day for the number days remaining in the original contract 
the company has not included asset retirement obligations as discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements  as the company cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect the company s financial disclosures 
oil and gas reserves gasco follows the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment would be recognized 
estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on the company because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the company s overall value 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of the company s proved properties 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of the company s wells have been producing less than five years  their production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the company s estimates of proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as the company s wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be redetermined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from the company s estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of the company s reserves 
for example a decrease in price of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel of oil would result in a decrease in the company s december  present value of future net cash flows of approximately  in addition  the company may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing gas and oil prices 
the company s reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
impairment of long lived assets the cost of the company s unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until such a time as the properties are either developed or abandoned 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
during  the company s management reviewed the unproved property located within the state of wyoming and determined that it would not be developing some of the acres that were not considered to be prospective 
as a result  the company estimated the value of these acres for the purpose of recording the related impairment 
the impairment was estimated by calculating a per acre value from the total unproved costs incurred for the wyoming acreage divided by the total net acres owned by the company 
this per acre estimate was applied to the acres that the company did not plan to develop to calculate the impairment 
as a result   of costs associated with this acreage was reclassified into the full cost pool during the year ended december  during the year ended december   approximately  of unproved lease costs related primarily to expiring acreage in wyoming was reclassified to proved property 
a change in the estimated value of the acreage could have a material impact on the total of the impairment recorded by the company 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from the sale of oil and gas production from its producing wells 
this revenue is recognized as income when the production is produced and sold 
the company typically receives its payment for production sold one to three months subsequent to the month the production is sold 
for this reason  the company must estimate the revenue that has been earned but not yet received by the company as of the reporting date 
the company uses actual production reports to estimate the quantities sold and the questar rocky mountain spot price less marketing and transportation adjustments to estimate the price of the production 
variances between our estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded in the month the payment is received 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles detailed in accounting principles board s opinion no 
apb no 

no stock based compensation expense has been reflected in the company s financial statements for the options granted to its employees as these options had exercise prices equal to or higher than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the required disclosures under sfas this model requires the company to estimate a risk free interest rate and the volatility of the company s common stock price 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
results of operations the following table presents information regarding the production volumes  average sales prices received and average production costs associated with the company s sales of natural gas for the periods indicated 
for the year ended december  natural gas production mcf    average sales price per mcf oil production bbl    average sales price per bbl compared to oil and gas revenue increased  during compared with due to an increase in oil and gas production of  bbls and  mcf combined with an increase in the average oil and gas prices of per bbl and per mcf during the  increase in oil and gas revenue during is comprised of  related to the production increase and  related to the price increase 
the production increase is due to the company s drilling  completion and recompletion activity during and and is partially offset by the production decrease resulting from the company s disposition of approximately of its revenue interest in two wells during the first quarter of in accordance with its service party arrangements as discussed above and by normal production declines on all wells

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies for the first fiscal year beginning after june   supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for the company  beginning january  sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods  either for all prior periods presented or to the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is adopted  based on previous pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard and estimates that the adoption sfas no 
r will have an effect on the financial statements similar to the pro forma effects reported in note of the accompanying financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
in september regarding the application of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  for oil and gas producing entities that follow the full cost accounting method 
sab no 
 states that after adoption of sfas no 
 the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet should be excluded from the present value of estimated future net cash flows used for the full cost ceiling test calculation 
the company has calculated its ceiling test computation in this manner since the adoption of sfas no 
and  therefore  sab no 
had no effect on the company s financial statements  effective in the fourth quarter of in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
 which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and specifically when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the adoption did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which changes the guidance in apb  accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on the company s financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk relates to changes in the pricing applicable to the sales of gas production in the uinta basin of northeastern utah and the greater green river basin of west central wyoming 
this risk will become more significant to the company as more wells are drilled and begin producing in these areas 
although the company is not using derivatives at this time to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in commodity prices  it may consider using them in the future 
the company does not have any obligations that are subject to variable rates of interest
