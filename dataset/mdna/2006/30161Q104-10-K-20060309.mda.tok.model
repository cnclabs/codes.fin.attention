item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview exelixis is committed to developing innovative therapies for cancer and other serious diseases 
through our discovery research and clinical development initiatives  we are building a portfolio of novel compounds that we believe have the potential to be high quality  differentiated pharmaceutical products 
utilizing our library of more than four million compounds  we integrate high throughput processes  medicinal chemistry  bioinformatics  structural biology and early in vivo testing in parallel to characterize thousands of compounds  a process that is designed to enable us to move with speed in research and development 
this approach allows us to select highly qualified drug candidates that meet our extensive list of development criteria from a large pool of compounds 
to date  we have filed eight investigational new drug applications inds 
we believe that our deep pool of drug candidates will enable us to continue to file multiple new inds each year for the foreseeable future 
as our compounds advance into clinical development  we expect to generate a critical mass of data that will help us to understand the full clinical and commercial potential of our product candidates 
in addition to guiding the potential commercialization of our innovative therapies  these data may contribute to the understanding of disease and help improve treatment outcomes 
our current pipeline includes the following compounds compound targets indication stage of development xl topoisomerase biliary tract cancer phase xl vegfr  pdgfr  fgfr renal cell carcinoma  colon  ovarian  non small cell lung cancers phase xl adam diabetic nephropathy phase xl egfr  her  vegfr cancer phase xl c met  vegfr cancer phase xl c kit  vegfr and pdgfr cancer phase xl chk and cancer phase xl c met  vegfr cancer phase xl raf cancer preclinical xl akt sk cancer preclinical xl abl  src cancer preclinical xl mr hypertension preclinical xl fxr atherosclerosis preclinical exel lxr atherosclerosis preclinical xl  xl and exel are out licensed to helsinn  wyeth and bms  respectively as described in this report 
out licensed to symphony evolution  inc and subject to exclusive repurchase options as described in this report 
pursuant to a product development and commercialization agreement between exelixis and glaxosmithkline  glaxosmithkline has the option  after completion of clinical proof of concept by 
table of contents exelixis  to elect to develop up to three compounds in exelixis product pipeline  which may include xl and the cancer compounds identified in the table above other than xl 
we have established collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based on the strength of our technologies and expertise in biology  drug discovery and development that allow us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products 
through these collaborations  we obtain license fees  research funding  and the opportunity to receive milestone payments and royalties from research results and subsequent product development activities 
we have ongoing commercial collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb and genentech 
we expect to continue to use corporate partnering as a strategic tool to cultivate our assets  fund our operations and expand the therapeutic and commercial potential of our pipeline 
as our company has matured and our development efforts have intensified  we have restructured our organization as needed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations 
we believe that these efforts have strengthened us by enabling us to achieve an appropriate functional balance within our organization 
certain factors that may affect our business industry wide factors successful development of drugs is highly difficult and uncertain 
our business requires significant investments in research and development over many years  often for products that fail during the research and development process 
our long term prospects depend upon our ability and the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize new therapeutics in highly competitive areas such as cancer 
company specific factors our financial performance will be driven by many factors  including clinical trials 
we currently have multiple compounds in clinical testing and expect to continue to advance more compounds into clinical development 
our compounds may fail to show safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
furthermore  predicting the timing of the completion or initiation of clinical trials is exceedingly difficult and our trials may be delayed due to many factors  including factors outside of our control 
the future development path of each of our compounds depends upon the results of each stage of clinical development 
in general  we will incur increased operating expenses for compounds that advance to the next stage of clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
liquidity 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  which included restricted cash and investments of million and investments held by symphony evolution  inc sei of million 
we currently anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investments held by sei  additional committed financing from sei and other funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which includes a moderate level of business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations for at least the next months 
this estimate includes the scheduled repayment of a million convertible promissory note to protein design labs due in may we will have to obtain additional funding in order to support the aggressive development of our broad clinical and preclinical pipelines 
our minimum liquidity needs are also determined by certain financial covenants contained in our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  which require us to maintain working capital of at least million and cash and investments of at least million 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if any of our product candidates fails to show safety or efficacy in clinical testing 

table of contents reliance on partners 
we currently have no pharmaceutical products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues from the sale of such products 
we do not expect to generate product revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the near term and expect that all of our revenues  such as milestone and royalty revenues  will be generated from collaboration agreements with our partners 
milestones under these agreements may be tied to factors that are outside of our control  such as significant clinical or regulatory events with respect to compounds that have been licensed to our partners 
glaxosmithkline compound selection 
pursuant to our product development and commercialization agreement with glaxosmithkline  glaxosmithkline has the option  after completion of clinical proof of concept by us  to elect to develop up to three compounds in our product pipeline  which may include xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl and two earlier stage oncology programs 
a compound selection by glaxosmithkline could potentially trigger significant milestone payments 
the size of these milestone payments depends largely on how quickly we can advance compounds to proof of concept 
delays in obtaining clinical proof of concept for compounds subject to glaxosmithkline s election rights may decrease the size of any glaxosmithkline milestones and negatively impact our financial position 
symphony evolution 
in  we licensed three of our lead compounds xl  xl and xl to sei in return for up to million in investment for the clinical development of these compounds 
we continue to be primarily responsible for the development of these compounds in accordance with a specified development plan and related development budget 
we have retained exclusive options to reacquire the compounds from sei at specified purchase prices 
if glaxosmithkline elects any of the compounds licensed to sei for further development  we would have to repurchase such compound or compounds from sei 
if selection milestones received under our glaxosmithkline collaboration are insufficient to cover the repurchase price  we may have to raise additional funds to cover the repurchase price 
in addition  the repurchase prices for the compounds licensed to sei increase over the length of the option period 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition most of our revenues are generated from complex research and licensing arrangements 
these research and licensing arrangements may include up front non refundable payments 
although these up front payments are 
table of contents generally non refundable  under gaap we defer the revenues under these arrangements and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over our expected period of continuing involvement  generally the research term specified in the agreements 
our research and license arrangements may also include milestone payments 
although these milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize the milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized on the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
it is our understanding that there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative acceptable milestone revenue recognition policy whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by a material amount compared to total revenue recognized 
goodwill and intangible impairment as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level and require us to perform a two step impairment test 
our reporting units have been determined to be consistent with our operating segments 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or assessing the recoverability of our other intangible assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we do not believe other reasonable assumptions would have yielded an impairment of goodwill 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations cros and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for pre clinical studies performed by our vendors based on certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled and the duration for which they will be enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with cros and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 

table of contents stock option valuation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the stock price volatility 
the methods we have used to determine the input assumptions are similar to the methodology outlined under the new standard as discussed below 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  changes to the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value of our employee stock options 
we have evaluated our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
we will adopt fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and the black scholes option pricing model  as outlined by this standard  beginning january  under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
we have limited historical information available to support the underlying estimates of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
because our historical exercise data is limited  we expect to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term as outlined in staff accounting bulletin no 
the simplified method establishes an estimate of the expected term as the mid point between the vesting term and the maximum contractual term 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues total revenues by category for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  contract revenues research and development funding milestones delivery of compounds under chemistry collaborations other license revenues amortization of upfront payments  including premiums paid on equity purchases total revenues total revenues  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total revenues dollar increase percentage increase the increase in research and development funding from to was driven primarily by increases in funding of million from glaxosmithkline  million in funding from the recognition of an early termination fee associated with the termination of our genoptera collaboration and million in funding from genentech 
the increase from to was driven primarily by increases in funding of million from glaxosmithkline and million in funding from sankyo  partially offset by a decrease of million in funding related to the conclusion of our collaboration with protein design labs 
the increase in milestone revenues from to was driven primarily by million in revenues associated with achieving two milestones under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline and a million acceleration of milestone revenues associated with the termination of our genoptera collaboration 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in milestone revenues related to the termination of one of our bristol myers squibb collaborations 
the increase from to was driven primarily by million associated with our bristol myers squibb collaboration 
the decrease in revenues from the delivery of compounds under chemistry collaborations was due to the termination of most of these collaborations effective december  these collaborations included agreements with cytokintetics  elan  schering plough  scios and merck 
the increase from to was driven primarily by an increase in the delivery of compounds 
the increase in the amortization of upfront payments  including premiums paid on equity purchases  from to was driven primarily by an additional million in revenues from the acceleration of upfront payments associated with the termination of our genoptera collaboration and upfront payments of million from helsinn and million from genentech 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to the termination of one of our bristol myers squibb collaborations 
the decrease from to was driven primarily by decreases of million associated with the termination of one of our bristol myers squibb collaborations in july 
table of contents the following table sets forth the percentage total revenues recognized under our collaboration agreements that exceeded or more of total revenues during the years ending december   and collaborator glaxosmithkline genoptera bristol myers squibb the glaxosmithkline increase in revenues from to of million is primarily related to milestones achieved during may and increased research and development funding 
the increase in genoptera revenues from to of million is due to the acceleration of upfront payments  milestones and a termination payment associated with the termination of our genoptera collaboration 
we will not receive any revenues from genoptera after due to the termination of this collaboration 
the bristol myers squibb decrease in revenues from to of million is primarily related to the termination of one of our bristol myers squibb collaborations 
the slight decreases from to in revenues from glaxosmithkline  genoptera and bristol myers squibb are primarily related to an overall increase in revenues from sources other than these collaborators 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  research and development expenses dollar increase percentage increase research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  laboratory supplies  consulting and facilities costs 
the change in compared to resulted primarily from the following consulting and professional consulting and professional expense  which includes services performed by cros and other vendors  increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase in activities associated with advancing our clinical and preclinical development programs 
these activities included phase clinical trial activity for xl  phase clinical trial activity for xl and phase clinical trial activity for xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl and xl personnel personnel expense  which includes salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs  increased by million  or  primarily due to the expansion of our drug development operations 
facilities facilities expense increased by million  or  primarily due to our expansion into two additional buildings in south san francisco  california largely as a result of our expanding development operations 
we occupied the first building in july and the second in july the increase was also attributable to an additional building lease in san diego  california  which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of x ceptor in october lab supplies lab supplies expense decreased by million  or  primarily due to the termination of most of our combinatorial chemistry collaborations 

table of contents changes in research and development expenses in compared to resulted primarily from the following costs consulting and professional consulting and professional expense increased by million  or  primarily due to activities related to advancing our clinical and preclinical development programs 
these activities included phase clinical trial activity for xl  phase clinical trial activity for xl and xl  filing inds for xl and xl  and moving xl  xl  xl and xl through preclinical testing in anticipation of filing inds in facilities facilities expense increased by million  or  primarily due to our expansion into an additional building in south san francisco  california as a result of our expanding development operations and activities associated with advancing our preclinical and clinical development programs 
the increase is also attributable to an additional building lease in san diego  california  which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of x ceptor in october personnel personnel expense decreased by million  or  primarily due to our june restructuring that consolidated our research and discovery organizations and included a reduction in force of employees 
lab supplies lab supplies expense decreased by million  or  primarily due to our june restructuring 
we currently estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time may vary substantially according to factors relating to the specific clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the product candidate  the clinical trial design and ability to enroll suitable patients 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we advance our compounds through development 
we currently do not have estimates of total costs to reach the market by a particular drug candidate or in total 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and that may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development  including the purchase of property and equipment  to support our expanding preclinical and clinical development operations 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  general and administrative expenses dollar increase percentage increase general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses to support our general operating activities  facility costs and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
the increase in from resulted primarily from increases in personnel expenses of million to support development activities  legal and accounting expenses of million  consulting expenses of million as well as facility expenses of million 
the increase from to was primarily due to increases in personnel expenses of million  legal and accounting expenses of million and facility expenses of million 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets total amortization of intangible assets  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  amortization of intangible assets dollar increase percentage increase intangible assets result from our acquisitions of x ceptor  genomica  artemis and agritope renamed exelixis plant sciences 
these assets are amortized over specified time periods 
the increase in amortization expense in compared to was due to the partial year amortization in of the assembled workforce that we acquired as a part of x ceptor 
the increase in as compared to was due to approximately two months of workforce amortization related to the x ceptor acquisition 
restructuring charges during the second quarter of  we implemented a restructuring and consolidation of our research and discovery organizations designed to optimize our ability to generate multiple new  high quality investigational new drug applications per year and rapidly advance these new drug candidates through clinical development 
the restructuring included a reduction in force of employees  the majority of whom were research personnel located in south san francisco  california 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the year ended december   comprised of involuntary termination benefits 
during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring of our research and development organization designed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations 
the restructuring included a reduction in force of research personnel located in south san francisco  california and t bingen  germany  closure of our t bingen location and relocation of certain research activities and employees from t bingen to south san francisco 
the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of march  in connection with this restructuring plan  we recorded a cumulative charge of million in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  of which million was recorded during the year ended december  this charge consisted primarily of severance payments  retention bonuses  relocation costs  lease buyout costs and legal and outplacement services fees 
the restructuring charge also included non cash activity  including an impairment of assets of million and a gain on closure of our t bingen location of million related to the removal from equity of the cumulative currency translation adjustment 
acquired in process research and development in may  we purchased from bayer cropscience its interest in agrinomics llc  our joint venture with bayer cropscience  in exchange for releasing bayer cropscience from all future obligations under the joint venture agreement 
we recorded the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based on valuation techniques in accordance with gaap 
as a result  we recorded net tangible liabilities of million  intangible assets of million and expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  representing the fair value of two primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in october  we completed the acquisition of x ceptor  a company focused on the discovery and development of therapies targeting metabolic and cardiovascular disorders 
the transaction was accounted for as 
table of contents a purchase of assets 
the total consideration for the acquisition was million  which consisted of million shares of our common stock  million in cash and million in transaction costs 
the transaction costs included financial advisory  legal  accounting and other fees 
as a result  we recorded tangible assets of million  liabilities of million  assembled workforce of million and expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  representing the fair value of three primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use due to the early stage of the programs and the significant regulatory requirements remaining 
independent valuation experts assisted us during the valuation of the intangible assets acquired 
the valuation of the acquired in process research and development of million was determined using the income approach for each of the three projects in process 
the in process projects relate to the development of programs that are focused on lxr  valued at million  fxr  valued at million  and mr  valued at million  which at the time of the acquisition were expected to be completed over approximately the next seven to ten years 
at the time of the acquisition  these programs did not have a development candidate 
the income approach estimates the value of each acquired project in process based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the percent complete of each in process research and development project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of which is considered commensurate with the inherent risk and percentage of completion of the in process projects 
the purchased technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and since it has no alternative future use due to the early stage of the programs  the considerable complexity and uniqueness of the programs and the significant regulatory requirements remaining  it was recorded as a component of operating expense 
the revenues  expenses  cash flows and other assumptions underlying the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development involve significant risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the acquired in process projects include obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and being able to successfully and profitably produce  distribute and sell products 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with wyeth pharmaceuticals division wyeth 
we granted to wyeth an exclusive  worldwide license with respect to certain intellectual property primarily relating to compounds that modulate fxr 
in addition  in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapies targeted against lxr 
total other income expense total other income expense  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total other income expense dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease total other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  offset by interest expense incurred on our notes payable  bank obligations  capital lease obligations and convertible notes and loans 
the decrease in other expense for compared to was primarily due to increases in interest expense as a result of an increase in the principal balance of our convertible loan with glaxosmithkline 
the increased expenses were partially offset by increases in interest income as a result of an increase in our investment balances and higher average interest rates 
the decrease in compared 
table of contents to was the result of increases in our notes payable  bank obligations and convertible loans 
our convertible loans increased by million in december and december in addition  our interest income decreased due to an overall decline in our investment balances during noncontrolling interest in symphony evolution  inc pursuant to the agreements that we entered into with sei and certain other parties in june  we consolidate sei s financial condition and results of operations in accordance with fin r 
accordingly  we have deducted the losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest sei s losses from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations and we have also reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in sei in the consolidated balance sheet by sei s losses 
for the years ended december  and  the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders were million and none  respectively 
income taxes we have incurred net losses since inception and  consequently  have not recorded any us federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had federal and california research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates  which began in we recorded a tax provision of million during the year ended december  related to income earned in our foreign operations 
due to a favorable outcome on a position we took with the german tax authorities  we reversed the tax provision in we do not expect to pay income taxes on our foreign operations for the years ended december   or under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions  certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they are used 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended december  and dollar amounts are presented in thousands year ended december  net loss adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  at end of year 
table of contents to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  payments and loans from collaborators  equipment financing facilities and interest income 
we have also financed certain of our research and development activities under our agreements with sei 
in august  we received net proceeds  after underwriting fees and offering expenses  of million from the sale of million shares of our common stock under a shelf registration statement 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  which includes restricted cash and investments of million and investments held by sei of million 
operating activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash used in operating activities during related primarily to funding net losses and losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest  partially offset by changes in deferred revenues from collaborators and non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operating activities during related primarily to funding net losses and changes in deferred revenues from collaborators and accrued merger and acquisition costs  partially offset by non cash charges related to acquired in process research and development  depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
cash used in operating activities during related primarily to funding net losses and changes in deferred revenues from collaborators  partially offset by non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles 
the decrease of million in cash used in our operating activities for as compared to was primarily driven by a million decrease in our net loss 
while cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our net loss  operating cash flows differ from our net loss as a result of differences in the timing of cash receipts and earnings recognition  expenses related to the noncontrolling interest and non cash charges 
for example  we recorded a net increase in deferred revenues of million during this increase in deferred revenues represented the excess of cash received in over the revenues which were recognized and included in the calculation of net loss 
in addition  net loss in excluded losses which are attributed to the noncontrolling interest in sei 
however  our cash used in operating activities in included expenses related to million in losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest 
the increase of million in cash used in our operating activities for as compared to was primarily driven by a million increase in our net loss  partially offset by a million non cash charge from acquired in process research and development expenses 
we expect to use cash for operating activities for at least the next several years as we continue to incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for and cash used in investing activities of million for cash used in investing activities for was primarily due to purchases and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  purchases of investments held by sei and purchases of property and equipment 
cash used and provided by investing activities for and were primarily due to purchases and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  purchases of property and equipment and changes in restricted cash 
the increase of million in cash used in investing activities for as compared to was primarily driven by increases of million from purchases of investments held by sei and million from purchases of marketable securities  along with a decrease of million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 
this increase was partially offset by decreases of million in restricted cash and investments and million from proceeds from the sale of investments held by sei 
the increase of million in cash provided by investment activities in as compared to was primarily driven by a 
table of contents decrease of million from purchases of marketable securities offset by decreases of million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and million from the sale of marketable securities 
during  and  we made investments in property and equipment of million  million and million  respectively  and we expect to continue to make purchases of property and equipment to build research and development and administrative infrastructure to support our expanding preclinical and clinical development operations 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily driven by net proceeds of million from the purchase of the noncontrolling interest by preferred shareholders in sei and net proceeds of million received through the sale of our common stock 
in addition  we received million in cash from the purchase of million shares of our common stock by glaxosmithkline  which included a million premium 
cash provided by our financing activities in included a draw under our glaxosmithkline loan facility of million 
cash provided by our financing activities in was primarily driven by the follow on public offering of million shares of registered common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we finance property and equipment purchases through equipment financing facilities  such as capital leases  notes and bank obligations 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities  merger and acquisition expenses and other general corporate purposes 
during  we have the ability to draw up to an additional million from sei 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on capital leases  notes  bank obligations and loans from collaborators 
cash requirements we have incurred net losses since inception  including a net loss of million for the year ended december   and expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
we currently anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investments held by sei  additional committed financing from sei and other funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which includes a moderate level of business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations for at least the next months 
this estimate includes the scheduled repayment of a million convertible promissory note to protein design labs due in may we may seek additional funding within this timeframe through collaborative relationships  private or public financing or other arrangements 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors  including the level of payments received under collaborative agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent clinical trials and other research and development projects  the timing and progress of the clinical development of our outlicensed product candidates xl  xl and xl  which will determine if and when we exercise our options to reacquire these product candidates  future clinical trial results  
table of contents our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  our ability to share the costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments relating to any such transactions  and the cost and timing of establishing or contracting for sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
in addition  we will have to obtain additional funding in order to stay in compliance with financial covenants contained in our collaboration with glaxosmithkline 
under a loan and security agreement  our working capital must not be less than million and our cash and investments must not be less than million 
if we were to default on the financial covenants under the loan and security agreement  glaxosmithkline may  among other remedies  declare immediately due and payable all obligations due thereunder 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we currently have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec that allows us to offer for sale from time to time common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants  either individually or in units 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
we have contractual obligations in the form of operating and capital leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years notes payable and bank obligations licensing agreements capital lease obligations convertible promissory note and loan operating leases total contractual cash obligations recent accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt sfas r on january  sfas r will require the recognition of stock based compensation at fair value in our statement of operations 
we expect to adopt sfas r under the 
table of contents modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we will record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock starting on january  we will also continue to apply the black scholes option pricing model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
under sfas r  option grants are generally valued at the grant date and those valuations do not change once they have been established 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense we expect to record in will be based largely upon the amortization of costs for awards granted in and prior periods 
this portion of our stock based compensation expense will be fairly predictable and is expected to be similar to our historical pro forma disclosures 
however  because of the variability in the assumptions to be used in the valuation of stock options we may grant in and the variability in the quantity and other terms of stock based awards we may issue in  our ability to predict the stock based compensation expense is limited 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of sfas r on our results of operations and financial condition and we currently estimate that our stock based compensation expense will be in the range of million to million for off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable sec regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except warrants and stock options 
our off balance sheet arrangements are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investments held by sei and restricted cash and investments of million and million  respectively 
our marketable securities and investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated income taxes 
we manage market risk through diversification requirements mandated by our investment policy  which limits the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
at december  and  we had long term debt and capital leases outstanding of million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments or a combination thereof 
the fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and as of december  and  a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we have assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from our estimate
