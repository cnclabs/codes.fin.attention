item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december    and in addition  this section contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are described in the risk factors section on page critical accounting policies the sec has recently issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition 
table of contents and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include valuation of loans  evaluation of the recoverability of accounts receivable and income tax assets  and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although the company believes that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december   are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
general the company is a specialty finance company that has a leading position in originating and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses 
since  the year in which the company became a public company  it has increased its medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of  and its commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 
total assets under our management  which includes assets serviced for third party investors  were approximately  at december   and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of from  at the end of the company s loan related earnings depend primarily on its level of net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the total yield on the company s loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds 
the company funds its operations through a wide variety of interest bearing sources  such as revolving bank facilities  bank certificates of deposit issued to customers  debentures issued to and guaranteed by the sba  and bank term debt 
net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on the company s loan portfolio and changes in the cost of borrowed funds  as well as changes in the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities held by the company 
net interest income is also affected by economic  regulatory  and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand  and the availability of funding to finance the company s lending activities 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice on a different basis than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company also invests in small businesses in selected industries through its subsidiary mci 
mci s investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest income is earned on the debt investments 
realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off 
the realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets  if any  and the cost of such portfolio assets 
in addition  changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period 
generally  realized gains losses on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments are inversely related 
when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs 
conversely  when a loss previously recorded as unrealized depreciation is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes a decrease in net unrealized depreciation and an increase in realized loss 
the company s investment in mtm  as wholly owned portfolio investments  was also subject to quarterly assessments of fair value 
the company used mtm s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 

table of contents trends in investment portfolio the company s investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on its investment portfolio 
to identify trends in the yields  the portfolio is grouped by medallion loans  commercial loans  consumer loans  equity investments  and investment securities

table of contents portfolio summary total portfolio yield the weighted average yield of the total portfolio at december  was for the loan portfolio  an increase of basis points from at december   which was an increase of basis points from at december  the increase from to primarily reflected the market increase in interest rates 
the increase from to primarily reflected the impact of the rv marine portfolio purchase and strong growth in the commercial loan portfolio  both at higher yields 
the company expects to try to increase the percentage of commercial and consumer loans in the total portfolio  the origination of floating and adjustable rate loans  and the level of non new york medallion loans to enhance our yields 
medallion loan portfolio the company s medallion loans comprised of the net portfolio of  at december   compared to of  at december  and of  at december  the medallion loan portfolio increased by  or in  primarily reflecting increases in new york and boston 
the increase in the new york market can be attributed to new business marketing efforts  the conversion of participations into owned loans  and the general increase in medallion values and related refinancings 
total medallion loans serviced for third parties were   and  at december    and the weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at december  was  an increase of basis points from at december   which was a decrease of basis points from at december  the increase in yield primarily reflected the impact of rising interest rates in the economy and the effects of borrower refinancings 
the decreases in yield a year ago primarily reflected the generally lower level of interest rates in the economy  and the effects of borrower refinancings 
at december   of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york  compared to and at year end and the company continues to focus its efforts on originating higher yielding medallion loans outside the new york market 
commercial loan portfolio since  and until  the company shifted the total portfolio mix toward a higher percentage of commercial loans  which historically had higher yields than medallion loans  and represented of the net investment portfolio as of december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
commercial loans increased by  or during primarily reflecting increased loan originations in the asset based and mezzanine loan portfolios  partially offset by the sale of  of sba section a loans 
total commercial loans serviced for third parties were   and  at december    and  and included   and  respectively  related to the sba section a business 
the company sold substantially all of the section a loans in its portfolio in connection with the sale of the assets of bll to a subsidiary of merrill lynch in october the weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at december  was  an increase of basis points from at december   which was up basis points from at december  the increased yield reflected the increases in market interest rates 
the increase in was primarily due to the higher origination volume in the high yielding mezzanine loan portfolio  partially offset by increased customer refinancing activities at lower rates 
the company continues to originate adjustable rate and floating rate loans tied to the prime rate to help mitigate its interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
at december   variable rate loans represented approximately of the commercial portfolio  compared to and at december  and although this strategy initially produces a lower yield  we believe that this strategy mitigates interest rate risk by better matching our earning assets to their adjustable rate funding sources 
consumer loan portfolios the company s consumer loans represented of the net investment portfolio as of december  compared to at december  about half of the existing portfolio was purchased on april  from an unrelated financial institution and the transaction closed may  the company started originating new adjustable rate consumer loans during the third quarter 
recreational vehicles  boats  and horse trailers located in all states collateralize the loans 
the portfolio is serviced by a third party subsidiary of a major commercial bank 

table of contents the weighted average gross yield of the consumer loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december  for and  the amortization of the portfolio purchase premium reduced the yield by an average of and  respectively 
at december   adjustable rate loans represented approximately of the consumer portfolio compared to at december  delinquency and loan loss experience we generally follow a practice of discontinuing the accrual of interest income on our loans that are in arrears as to interest payments for a period of days or more 
we deliver a default notice and begin foreclosure and liquidation proceedings when management determines that pursuit of these remedies is the most appropriate course of action under the circumstances 
a loan is considered to be delinquent if the borrower fails to make a payment on time  however  during the course of discussion on delinquent status  we may agree to modify the payment terms of the loan with a borrower that cannot make payments in accordance with the original loan agreement 
for loan modifications  the loan will only be returned to accrual status if all past due interest payments are brought fully current 
for credit that is collateral based  we evaluate the anticipated net residual value we would receive upon foreclosure of such loans  if necessary 
there can be no assurance  however  that the collateral securing these loans will be adequate in the event of foreclosure 
for credit that is cash flow based  we assess our collateral position  and evaluate most of these relationships on an enterprise value basis  expecting to locate and install a new operator to run the business and reduce the debt 
for the consumer loan portfolio  the process to repossess the collateral is started at days past due 
if the collateral is not located and the account reaches days delinquent  the account is charged off to realized losses 
if the collateral is repossessed  a realized loss is recorded to write the loan down to of its net realizable value  and the collateral is sent to auction 
when the collateral is sold  the net auction proceeds are applied to the account  and any remaining balance is written off as a realized loss  and any excess proceeds are recorded as a realized gain 
proceeds collected on charged off accounts are recorded as a realized gain 
all collection  repossession  and recovery efforts are handled on behalf of mb by the servicer 
the following table shows the trend in loans days or more past due as of december  medallion loans commercial loans secured mezzanine sba section a asset based receivable other secured commercial total commercial loans total consumer loans total loans days or more past due percentage is calculated against the total loan portfolio 
the company sold all of the sba section a loans in its portfolio in connection with the sale of the assets of bll to a subsidiary of merrill lynch in october in general  collection efforts since the establishment of our collection department have substantially contributed to the sizable reduction in overall delinquencies 
the decreases in medallion delinquencies primarily reflected the foreclosure of  of chicago medallions  and improvements in other borrower payment patterns 
secured mezzanine financing delinquencies have decreased  primarily reflecting payment activity  and to a lesser extent chargeoffs 
the company sold all of the section a loans in its portfolio in connection with the sale of the assets of bll to a subsidiary of merrill lynch in october included in the sba section a delinquency figures are   and  at december    and  which represented loans repurchased for the purpose of collecting on the sba guarantee 
the increase in other secured commercial loans primarily related to several customers being monitored by the collections group  and from an overall standpoint was down from a year ago 
the company is actively working with each delinquent borrower to bring them current  and believes that any potential loss exposure is reflected in the company s mark to market estimates on each loan 
although there can be no assurances as to changes in the trend rate  management believes that any loss exposures are properly reflected in reported asset values 

table of contents we monitor delinquent loans for possible exposure to loss by analyzing various factors  including the value of the collateral securing the loan and the borrower s prior payment history 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the valuation of our portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our portfolio  management and the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  management and the board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of long term  fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values that approximate that which would have been established by market forces  and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
based upon these factors  net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is determined  or the amount by which our estimate of the current realizable value of our portfolio is above or below our cost basis

table of contents equity investments equity investments were   and  of the company s total portfolio at december    and equity investments are comprised of common stock and warrants 
the decrease in equity investments during primarily reflected the sale of  of the  shares of common stock of ccu  and the increase during primarily reflected the receipt of  shares of common stock of ccu in a tax free exchange for of our ownership interest in media  partially offset by the sale of  of the ccu shares 
investment securities investment securities were and of the company s total portfolio at december  and the investment securities are primarily adjustable rate mortgage backed securities purchased by mb to better utilize required cash liquidity 
trend in interest expense the company s interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on its short term credit facilities with banks  bank certificates of deposit  fixed rate  long term debentures issued to the sba  and other short term notes payable 
the establishment of the merrill lynch commercial finance corp 
mlb line of credit in september and its favorable renegotiation in september and january had the effect of substantially reducing the company s cost of funds 
in addition  mb began raising brokered bank certificates of deposit during  which were at the company s lowest borrowing costs 
as a result of mb raising funds through certificates of deposits as previously noted  the company was able to realign the ownership of some of its medallion loans and related assets to mb allowing the company and its subsidiaries to use cash generated through these transactions to retire debt with higher interest rates 
in addition  mb is able to bid on these deposits at a wide variety of maturity levels which allows for improved interest rate management strategies 
during the third quarter  the trust closed a  line of credit with mlb for lending on medallion loans which was  through the end of  and which was increased to  in january  which was priced at libor plus  excluding fees and other costs 
all of the draws on this line were paid to mfc for medallion loans purchased  and were used by mfc to repay higher priced debt with the banks and noteholders  and to purchase loans for the trust from participants and affiliates 
during the third quarter  this line was renewed and extended  and borrowings were generally at libor plus 
during the first quarter  this line was further renewed and extended  and borrowings are now generally at libor plus 
in addition   of higher priced sba debentures were repaid during  and  was drawn back at lower borrowing rates 
the september  amendments repriced the bank loans to for the company and for mfc  and repriced mfc s senior secured notes to 
in addition to the interest rate charges  approximately  had been incurred through december  for attorneys and other professional advisors  most working on behalf of the lenders  and for prepayment penalties and default interest charges  of which   and  was expensed as part of costs of debt extinguishment  and   and  was expensed as part of interest expense in   and  respectively 
the company s cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on its various debt instruments and their relative mix  and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of all outstanding debt 
the company s debentures issued to the sba typically have terms of ten years 

table of contents the company measures its borrowing costs as its aggregate interest expense for all of its interest bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period 
the following table shows the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for   and average balances have increased from a year ago  primarily reflecting the establishment of mb and its resulting growth  and the funding needs to support the growth in the company s other investment portfolios 
the increase in borrowing costs reflected the trend of increasing interest rates in the economy and additional long term sba debt at higher rates  partially offset by the raising of low cost deposits by mb 
interest expense average balance average borrowing costs december  floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings total december  floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings total december  floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings total included in interest expense in was  of interest reversals 
adjusted for this amount  the floating rate borrowings average borrowing costs would have been  and the total average borrowing costs would have been 
the company will continue to seek sba funding to the extent it offers attractive rates 
sba financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur 
the company uses sba funding to fund loans that qualify under sbia and sba regulations 
the company believes that financing operations primarily with short term floating rate secured bank debt has generally decreased its interest expense  but has also increased the company s exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates  which the company mitigates with certain hedging strategies 
at december    and  short term floating rate debt constituted   and of total debt  respectively 
the decrease in reflects the issuance of bank certificates of deposit by mb  that are primarily of a short term nature 
taxicab advertising in addition to the company s finance business  mtm also conducted a taxicab rooftop advertising business primarily through media  which began operations in november  and ceased operations upon the merger of media with and into a subsidiary of ccu  and the sale of mmj to its management 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
although media was a wholly owned portfolio investment of the company  its results of operations were not consolidated with the company s operations because sec regulations prohibit the consolidation of non investment companies with investment companies 
factors affecting net assets factors that affect the company s net assets include net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments 
net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment 
change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the amount  if any  by which the company s estimate of the fair value of its investment portfolio is above or below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio 
under the act and the sbia  the company s loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses  but adjusts quarterly the valuation of the loan portfolio to reflect the company s estimate of the current value of the total loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for the company s loans  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of the company 
in determining such fair value  the company and its board of directors consider factors such as the financial condition of its borrowers and the adequacy of its collateral 
any change in the fair value of portfolio loans or other investments as determined by the company is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation of investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income 

table of contents the company s investment in mtm  as wholly owned portfolio investments  were also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value

asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion  commercial  and consumer loans  and investment securities reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of credit facilities with banks  bank certificates of deposit  and subordinated sba debentures 
having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  the company anticipates that approximately of the taxicab medallion portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
the company believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
however  borrowers may prepay for a variety of other reasons  such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values  particularly in the medallion loan portfolio 
in addition  the company manages its exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  such as ten year subordinated sba debentures  and by setting repricing intervals or the maturities of tranches drawn under the revolving line of credit or issued as certificates of deposit  for terms of up to five years 
the company had outstanding sba debentures of  with a weighted average interest rate of  constituting of the company s total indebtedness as of december  also  as of december   portions of the adjustable rate debt with banks repriced at intervals of as long as months  and certain of the certificates of deposit were for terms of up to months  further mitigating the immediate impact of changes in market interest rates 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities  and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 

table of contents the following table presents the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december   compared to the respective positions at the end of and the principal amount of interest earning assets are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be repriced 
the company has not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for such assets in this table

the company s interest rate sensitive assets were approximately  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were  at december  the one year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative  or of interest rate sensitive assets  compared to a positive  or at december  however  using our estimated prepayment refinancing rate for medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a positive gap of  or at december  the company seeks to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans  by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  by evaluating appropriate derivatives  pursuing securitization opportunities  and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk 
interest rate cap agreements from time to time  the company enters into interest rate cap agreements to manage the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by hedging a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates 
there were no interest rate caps outstanding during   and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity are the revolving line of credit with mlb  revolving lines of credit with other financial institutions  loan amortization and prepayments  participations or sales of loans to third parties  and our ability to raise brokered certificates of deposit through mb 
as a ric  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we have primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
the trust s  revolving line of credit with mlb had availability of  as of december  at the current required capital levels  it is expected  although there can be no guarantee  that deposits of approximately  could be raised by mb to fund future loan origination activity 
in addition  mb as a non ric subsidiary of the company is allowed and for three years required to retain all earnings in the business to fund future growth  and has  available under a fed funds line with a commercial bank 
lastly   was available under a revolving credit agreements with commercial banks  and in march  the sba approved a  commitment for mci to issue additional debentures to the sba during a ten year period upon payment of a fee and the infusion of  of additional capital 

table of contents the components of our debt were as follows at december  balance percentage rate revolving line of credit certificates of deposit sba debentures margin loan notes payable to banks total outstanding debt weighted average contractual rate as of december  the company s contractual obligations expire on or mature at various dates through september  the following table shows all contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than year years years years years more than years total floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings operating lease obligations total the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by the board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
the company records unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s equity investment has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect management s estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
the company s investment in mtm  as wholly owned portfolio investments  was also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company used mtm s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent by term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have negatively impacted net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations as of at december  by approximately  on an annualized basis  compared to a positive impact of  as of december   and the impact of such an immediate change over a one year period would have been  compared to  for although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other 
table of contents business developments that could affect net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates 
the company continues to work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include  among others  the sale or spin off certain assets or divisions  the development of a securitization conduit program  and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes 
these financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth

loan amortization  prepayments  and sales also provide a source of funding for the company 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  medallion loan market rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the company believes that its credit facilities with mlb  deposits generated at mb  and cash flow from operations after distributions to shareholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio
