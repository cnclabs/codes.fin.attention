the amendment extends the maturity by one year to march  lowers the borrowing rate to over the london interbank offered rate libor  eliminates the higher rate tier on the last  of borrowings and contains an accordion provision which allows us to increase the availability under the revolving line of credit by  to  during the next months following the amendment 
the amendment also lowers the company s unused commitment fee and adds a swing line availability of  for up to three business days 
in january  we further amended the bank revolving credit facility to increase the combined availability of letters of credit or surety bonds by  to  we have a track record of past successes and a strong pipeline of future opportunities 
with a balanced portfolio concentrated in the product types and geographic markets that offer many unique  financially rewarding opportunities  we appear to be well positioned for future growth 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include our accounts  all majority owned subsidiaries where we have financial or operational control  and variable interest entities vies where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are subject to judgment and uncertainties 
we have used our best judgment to determine estimates of certain amounts included in the financial statements as a result of these policies  giving due consideration to materiality 
as a result of uncertainties surrounding these events at the time the estimates are made  actual results could differ from these estimates causing adjustments to be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe contain uncertainties that are considered critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
our management reviews and discusses the policies below on a regular basis 
these policies have also been discussed with our audit committee of the board of directors 
recognition of revenue real estate sales we recognize gains on sales of real estate pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate sfas no 

the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the deposit  finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets for reporting dispositions of operating properties 
pursuant to the definition of a component of an entity in sfas no 
 assuming no significant continuing involvement  all earnings of properties which have been sold or determined by management to be held for sale are reported as discontinued operations 
we consider assets held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no significant contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the transaction from closing 
in most transactions  these contingencies are not satisfied until the actual closing and  accordingly  the property is not identified as held for sale until the closing actually occurs 
however  each potential sale is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances 
leasing operations we enter into leases with tenants in our rental properties 
the lease terms of tenants occupying space in the retail centers and office buildings generally range from to years  excluding leases with certain anchor tenants which typically run longer 
minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the related leases  which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
overage rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
recoveries from tenants for taxes  insurance  and other commercial property operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
construction revenue and profit on long term fixed price contracts are recorded using the percentage of completion method 
on reimbursable cost plus fee contracts  revenues are recorded in the amount of the accrued reimbursable costs plus proportionate fees at the time the costs are incurred 
recognition of costs and expenses operating expenses primarily represent the recognition of operating costs  which are charged to operations as incurred  administrative expenses and taxes other than income taxes 
interest expense and real estate taxes during active development and construction are capitalized as a part of the project cost 
major improvements and tenant improvements are capitalized and expensed through depreciation charges 
repairs  maintenance and minor improvements are expensed as incurred 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available 
table of contents for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
costs and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reported in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we review our properties to determine if their carrying costs will be recovered from future operating cash flows whenever events or changes indicate that recoverability of long lived assets may not be assured 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying costs  an impairment loss is recorded as a provision for decline in real estate 
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves on notes receivable we record allowances against our rent receivables from commercial and residential tenants that we deem to be uncollectible 
these allowances are based on management s estimate of receivables that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
this estimate is calculated based on a three year history of early tenant lease terminations as well as an estimate for expected activity of current tenants in the case of the straight line rent adjustments 
there is a risk that our estimate of the expected activity of current tenants may not accurately reflect future events 
if the estimate does not accurately reflect future tenant vacancies  the reserve for straight line rent receivable may be over or understated by the actual tenant vacancies that occur 
we estimate the allowance for notes receivable based on our assessment of the collectibility of the note 
our assessment of collectibility is based largely on expected future cash flows estimated to be paid to our limited partners 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows does not accurately reflect actual events  our reserve on notes receivable may be over or understated by the actual cash flows that occur 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes our straight line allowance  was  and  at january  and  respectively 
for the year ended january  we reduced reserves by  related to notes receivable at certain residential properties 
these reserves were reduced due to the occurrence of a series of events 
in the course of evaluating these events and their effect on the collectibility of the notes  we used estimates 
these estimates included  but were not limited to  estimated appraisal values as well as future cash flows at these properties 
these estimates can be affected by market conditions at the time that will not only affect the appraisal value but operating cash flow projections 
had different estimates been applied  the amount of the reserves reversed might have been different than the amounts actually recorded 
due to the company s implementation of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation number fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities  the balances of these notes and the respective reserves were eliminated 
historic tax credit entities we have certain investments in properties that have received  or we believe are entitled to receive  historic tax credits on qualifying expenditures under section of the internal revenue code of we typically enter into these investments with sophisticated financial investors 
in exchange for the financial investors initial contribution into these investments  they are entitled to substantially all of the benefits derived from the historic tax credit 
typically  these arrangements have put call provisions usually after five to seven years whereby we may be obligated or entitled to repurchase the financial investors interest 
due to the economic structure and resulting economic substance  we have consolidated each of these properties in our consolidated financial statements  and have reflected the investors contribution as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
as the amount that we might be obligated to pay upon redemption of the financial investors interest is not readily determinable or estimable  we will record any gain from such redemption in our consolidated statements of earnings in the period the transaction is consummated 
if we expect the redemption to result in a loss  such amount will be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings when deemed probable and estimable 
to date  we have not redeemed any of our financial investors interests 
economic lives depreciation and amortization is generally computed on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the estimated useful lives of buildings and certain first generation tenant allowances that are considered by management as a component of the building are primarily years 
subsequent tenant improvements are generally amortized over the life of the tenant s lease 
this estimate is based on the length of time the asset is expected to generate positive operating cash flows 
actual events and circumstances can cause the life of the building and tenant improvement to be different than the estimates made 
additionally  lease terminations can affect the economic life of the tenant improvements 
we believe the estimated useful lives and classification of the depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and tenant improvements are reasonable and follow industry standards 

table of contents asset impairment we review our investment portfolio to determine if its carrying costs will be recovered from future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes indicate that recoverability of long lived assets may not be assured 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs  an impairment loss is recorded as a provision for decline in real estate for assets in our real estate portfolio pursuant to the guidance established in sfas no 
as part of the analysis to determine if an impairment loss has occurred  we are required to make estimates to determine future operating cash flows 
if different estimates are applied in determining future operating cash flows  such as occupancy rates and rent and expense increases  we may not record an impairment loss  or may record a greater impairment loss on a property 
allowance for projects under development we record an allowance for development project write offs for our projects under development included in real estate  at cost on our consolidated balance sheets 
a specific project is written off against this allowance when it is determined by management that the project will not be developed 
the allowance  which is consistently applied  is adjusted on a quarterly basis based on our actual development project write off history 
the allowance decreased by  for the year ended january  and increased by  for the year ended january  there was no change in the allowance for the year ended january  any change in the allowance is reported in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings 
variable interest entities effective february   we adopted fin no 
r 
under fin no 
r  we are required to consolidate a vie if our interest in the vie is such that we will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
calculating expected losses and or expected residual returns involves estimating expected future cash flows 
if different estimates are applied in determining future cash flows  such as the probability of the future cash flows and the risk free rate  we may have otherwise concluded on the consolidation method of an entity

the difference between the amortized cost of the retained interest approximately zero and the fair value was recorded  net of the related tax and minority interest  in shareholders equity as a change in accumulated oci

mortgage financings our primary capital strategy seeks to isolate the financial risk at the property level to maximize returns and reduce risk on and of our equity capital 
our mortgage debt is nonrecourse  including our construction loans 
we operate as a c corporation and retain substantially all of our internally generated cash flows 
we recycle this cash flow  together with refinancing and property sale proceeds to fund new development and acquisitions that drive favorable returns for our shareholders 
this strategy provides us with the necessary liquidity to take advantage of investment opportunities 
we use taxable and tax exempt nonrecourse debt for our real estate projects 
for those projects financed with taxable debt  we generally seek long term  fixed rate financing for those real estate project loans which mature within the next months  as well as those real estate projects which are projected to open and achieve stabilized operations during that same time frame 
for real estate projects financed with tax exempt debt  we generally utilize variable rate debt 
for construction loans  we generally pursue variable rate financings with maturities ranging from two to five years 
we are actively working to extend the maturities and or refinance the nonrecourse debt that is coming due in and during the year ended january   we completed the following financings purpose of financing amount in thousands refinancings development projects commitment acquisitions loan extensions additional fundings interest rate exposure at january   the composition of nonrecourse mortgage debt was as follows total operating development weighted properties projects total average rate dollars in thousands fixed variable taxable tax exempt urban development action grant commitment from lenders taxable variable rate debt of  and tax exempt variable rate debt of  as of january  are protected with swaps and caps described below 

table of contents to mitigate short term variable interest rate risk  we have purchased interest rate hedges for our mortgage debt portfolio as follows taxable priced off of london interbank offered rate libor index caps swaps average average period covered amount base rate amount base rate dollars in thousands swaps include libor contracts that have an initial maturity greater than six months 
these libor based hedges as of february  protect the debt currently outstanding as well as the anticipated increase in debt outstanding for projects under development or anticipated to be under development during the year ending january  tax exempt priced off of bond municipal association bma index caps swaps average average period covered amount base rate amount base rate dollars in thousands the tax exempt caps expressed above mainly represent protection that was purchased in conjunction with lender hedging requirements that require the borrower to protect against significant fluctuations in interest rates 
outside of such requirements  we generally do not hedge tax exempt debt because  since  the base rate of this type of financing has averaged and has never exceeded 
due to the protection provided by the interest rate swaps  caps and long term contracts in place as of january   a basis point increase in taxable interest rates including properties accounted for under the equity method would not materially increase the annual pre tax interest cost for the next months of our taxable variable rate debt at january  a portion of our taxable variable rate debt is related to construction loans for which the interest expense is capitalized 
although tax exempt rates generally move in an amount that is smaller than corresponding changes in taxable interest rates  a basis point increase in tax exempt rates would increase the annual pre tax interest cost for the next months of our tax exempt variable rate debt by approximately  at january  from time to time  certain of our joint ventures the joint ventures enter into trs on various tax exempt fixed rate borrowings generally held within the joint ventures 
the trs convert these borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate and provide an efficient financing product to lower the cost of capital 
in exchange for a fixed rate  the trs require that the joint ventures pay a variable rate  generally equivalent to the bma rate 
additionally  the joint ventures have guaranteed the principal balance of the underlying borrowing 
any fluctuation in the value of the guarantee would be offset by the fluctuation in the value of the underlying borrowing  resulting in no financial impact to the joint ventures or the company 
at january   the aggregate notional amount of trs in which the joint ventures have an interest is approximately  the fair value of such contracts is immaterial at january  and we believe the economic return and related risk associated with a trs is generally comparable to that of nonrecourse variable rate mortgage debt

table of contents commitments and contingencies we have adopted the provisions of fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

we believe the risk of payment under these guarantees as described below is remote and  to date  no payments have been made under these guarantees 
as of january   we have a guaranteed loan of  relating to our share of a bond issue made by the village of woodridge  relating to a land development group project in suburban chicago  illinois 
this guarantee was entered into prior to january   and therefore  has not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at january   pursuant to the provisions of fin no 
this bond issue guarantee terminates april   unless the bonds are paid sooner  and is limited to  in any one year 
we also had outstanding letters of credit of  as of january  the maximum potential amount of future payments on the guaranteed loans and letters of credit we could be required to make are the total amounts noted above 
as a general partner for certain limited partnerships  we guaranteed the funding of operating deficits of newly opened apartment projects for an average of five years 
these guarantees were entered into prior to january   and therefore  have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at january   pursuant to the provisions of fin no 
at january   the maximum potential amount of future payments on these operating deficit guarantees we could be required to make was approximately  we would seek to recover any amounts paid through refinancing or sales proceeds of the apartment project 
these partnerships typically require us to indemnify  on an after tax or grossed up basis  the investment partner against the failure to receive  or the loss of allocated tax credits and tax losses 
at january   the maximum potential payment under these tax indemnity guarantees was approximately  we believe that all necessary requirements for qualifications for such tax credits have been and will continue to be met and that our investment partners will be able to receive expense allocations associated with the properties 
we have obtained legal opinions from nationally recognized law firms supporting the validity of the tax credits 
we do not expect to make any payments under these guarantees 
our mortgage loans are nonrecourse  however in some cases lenders carve out certain items from the nonrecourse provisions 
these carve out items enable the lenders to seek recourse if we or the joint venture commit fraud  voluntarily file for bankruptcy  intentionally misapply funds  transfer title without lender consent  or intentionally misrepresent facts 
we have also provided certain environmental guarantees 
under these environmental remediation guarantees  we must remediate any hazardous materials brought onto the property in violation of environmental laws 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is limited to the actual losses suffered or actual remediation costs incurred 
a portion of these carve outs and guarantees have been made on behalf of joint ventures and while the amount of the potential liability is currently indeterminable  we believe any liability would not exceed our partners share of the outstanding principal balance of the loans in which these carve outs and environmental guarantees have been made 
at january   the outstanding balance of the partners share of these loans was approximately  we believe the risk of payment on the carve out guarantees is mitigated in most cases by the fact we manage the property  and in the event our partner did violate one of the carve out items  we would seek recovery from our partner for any payments we would make 
additionally  we further mitigate our exposure through environmental insurance 
we have guaranteed the obligations of forest city rental properties corporation  or fcrpc  under the fcrpc credit agreement  dated as of march   as amended  among fcrpc  the banks named therein  keybank national association  as administrative agent  and national city bank  as syndication agent 
this guaranty imposes a number of restrictive covenants on us  including a prohibition on certain consolidations and mergers and limitations on the amount of debt  guarantees and property liens that we may incur 
the guaranty also requires us to maintain a specified minimum cash flow coverage ratio  consolidated shareholders equity and earnings before depreciation and taxes  or ebdt 
we are in compliance with the covenants under the guaranty at january  we monitor our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
other than those environmental matters identified during the acquisition of a site which are generally remediated prior to the commencement of development  we are not aware of any environmental liability with respect to our operating properties that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that such a material environmental liability does not exist 
the existence of any such material environmental liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
we carry environmental insurance and believe that the policy terms  conditions  limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances  given the relative risk of loss  the cost of such coverage and current industry practice 
we customarily guarantee lien free completion of projects under construction 
upon completion  the guarantees are released 
additionally  we also provide lien free completion guarantees on the infrastructure on the land we develop and is later sold to 
table of contents customers or is held for master planned communities or mixed use projects 
at january   we had provided the following completion guarantees total external outstanding total percent funding loan costs completed sources balance in thousands projects under construction land our subsidiaries have been successful in consistently delivering lien free completion of construction and land projects  without calling our guarantees of completion 
we are also involved in certain claims and litigation related to our operations 
based on the facts known at this time  management has consulted with legal counsel and is of the opinion that the ultimate outcome of all such claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on august   we purchased an ownership interest in the nba franchise known as the nets that is reported on the equity method of accounting 
although we have an ownership interest of approximately in the nets  we currently recognized approximately and of the net loss for the years ended january  and  respectively  because profits and losses are allocated to each member based on an analysis of the respective member s claim on the net book equity assuming a liquidation at book value at the end of the accounting period without regard to unrealized appreciation if any in the fair value of the nets 
in connection with the purchase of the franchise  we and certain of our partners have provided an indemnity guarantee to the nba for any losses arising from the transaction  including the potential relocation of the team 
our indemnity is limited to  and is effective as long as we own an interest in the team 
the indemnification provisions are standard provisions that are required by the nba 
we have insurance coverage of approximately  in connection with such indemnity 
we evaluated the indemnity guarantee in accordance with fin no 
and determined that the fair value for our liability for our obligations under the guarantee was not material 
in addition  the nets are a party to an arbitration challenging an insurance company s denial of temporary total disability benefits on one of its former players 
the maximum amount of our share of this claim approximates  this claim is being vigorously defended  and is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this dispute at this time 
as management of the nets believe that an adverse judgment is not probable  and the amount of loss  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated  or otherwise management believes is recoverable from the previous owners  the nets have not accrued a loss associated with this matter at january  certain of our ground leases include provisions requiring us to indemnify the ground lessor against claims or damages occurring on or about the leased property during the term of the ground lease 
these indemnities generally were entered into prior to january   and therefore  have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at january  in accordance with fin no 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is limited to the actual losses suffered 
we mitigate our exposure to loss related to these indemnities through insurance coverage 
we are party to an easement agreement under which we have agreed to indemnify a third party for any claims or damages arising from the use of the easement area of one of our development projects 
we have also entered into an environmental indemnity at one of our development projects whereby we agree to indemnify a third party for the cost of remediating any environmental condition 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is limited to the actual losses suffered or actual remediation costs incurred 
we mitigate our exposure to loss related to the easement agreement and environmental indemnity through insurance coverage 
we are party to an agreement whereby we have issued a  guarantee in connection with certain environmental work to the extent such environmental work is required as a result of investigative work which is being performed to determine the feasibility of constructing a mixed use development project in brooklyn  new york 
the guaranty expires at some point in time between six and nine years after completion of the investigative work as stipulated in the agreement 
we have recorded a liability of  related to this agreement for the year ended january   which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
we mitigate our exposure to loss related to this agreement through an environmental insurance policy

the company has an effective ownership interest of approximately in the nets for the year ended january  the timing of these obligations can be accelerated or deferred due to player retirements  trades and renegotiation 
these amounts represent funds that we are legally obligated to pay under various service contracts  employment contracts and licenses over the next several years 
these contracts are typically greater than one year and either do not contain a cancellation clause or cannot be terminated without substantial penalty 
we have several service contracts with vendors related to our property management including maintenance  landscaping  security  phone service  etc 
in addition  we have other service contacts that we enter into during our normal course of business which extend beyond one year and are based on usage including snow plowing  answering services  copier maintenance and cycle painting 
as we are unable to predict the usage variables  these contracts have been excluded from our summary of contractual obligations at january  refer to item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a substantial amount of non recourse mortgage debt  the details of which are further described within the interest rate exposure section of this md a 
we are contractually obligated to pay the interest and principle when due on these mortgages 
because we utilize mortgage debt as one of our primary sources of capital  the balances and the terms of the mortgages and therefore the estimate of future contractual obligations are subject to frequent changes due to property dispositions  mortgage refinancings  changes in variable interest rates and new mortgage debt in connection with property additions 
we believe that the information contained within the md a provides reasonable information to assist an investor in estimating the future interest obligations related to the non recourse mortgage debt reflected on our consolidated balance sheets

inflation substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive additional rental income from escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases and or percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales 
such escalations are determined by negotiation  increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  we seek increased rents upon renewal at market rates for our short term leases 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
 was issued 
in december  the fasb published a revision of the interpretation fin no 
r to clarify some of the provisions of fin no 
and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie are to be included in the consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds a variable interest in a vie consolidates the entity if the company s interest is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vies expected losses and or receive a majority of the vies expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin no 
r also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
we implemented fin no 
r on february  previously  we adopted the consolidation requirements for vies created after january   and the disclosure provisions of the interpretation that were effective upon issuance 
as a result  we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of previously unconsolidated vies representing properties vies representing eight properties in residential group  five vies properties in commercial group  and one vie property in land development group 
of these vies  vies representing properties nine vies representing eight properties in residential group  four vies properties in commercial group  and one vie property in land development group that were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting have been fully consolidated 
the remaining vies representing one property ten vies in residential group and one vie property in commercial group that were previously accounted for using the cost method of accounting have also been fully consolidated 
in addition  five properties in the residential group  which were determined to be vies  have been deconsolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary of these properties 
although we are an equity investor in these properties  we lack certain decision making authority 
specifically  these properties are part of government sponsored housing programs that are administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
we determined through a review of the contractual agreements for these government sponsored programs that the decision making rights of hud  a non equity investor  are restrictive rights that have a significant impact on these five properties 
we determined that hud is the primary beneficiary of these vies because it is most closely associated with the vies 
the vies activities include providing affordable housing for those individuals that qualify as low income individuals  which is also hud s primary goal  mission  or purpose 
consistent with the provisions of fin no 
r  we do not consider the activities of these vies significant as they only have a de minimus effect on all the principal captions in the consolidated balance sheet 
for the year ended january   we recorded a charge of   net of tax for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in accordance with fin no 
r  which resulted in a reduction of net earnings 
this charge consisted primarily of our share of accumulated depreciation and amortization expense of the newly consolidated vies that were previously accounted for on the cost method 
upon implementation of fin no 
r on february   we determined that we hold variable interests in other vies representing properties in residential group and one in land development group for which we are not the primary beneficiary 
of the residential entities  including the five that were previously consolidated have been subsequently deconsolidated as disclosed above in accordance with the provisions of fin no 
r 
we are involved with these unconsolidated vies as an equity holder  lender  management agent  or through other contractual relationships 
the maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these unconsolidated vies was limited to our recorded investments in those vies totaling approximately  at february   which are recorded as investments in and advances to affiliates 
in addition  we have various vies that were previously consolidated that remain consolidated under fin no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
at january   our outstanding variable rate debt portfolio consisted of  of taxable debt which includes  related to the bank revolving credit facility and  of tax exempt variable rate debt which includes  of subordinated debt 
upon opening and achieving stabilized operations  we generally pursue long term fixed rate nonrecourse financing for our rental properties 
additionally  when the properties fixed rate debt matures  the maturing amounts are subject to interest rate risk 
to mitigate short term variable interest rate risk  we have purchased interest rate hedges for our variable rate debt as follows taxable priced off of london interbank offering rate libor index caps swaps average average period covered amount base rate amount base rate dollars in thousands swaps include libor contracts that have an initial maturity greater than six months 
these libor based hedges as of february  protect the debt currently outstanding as well as the anticipated increase in debt outstanding for projects under development or anticipated to be under development during the year ending january  tax exempt priced off of bond municipal association bma index caps swaps average average amount base rate amount base rate dollars in thousands period covered the tax exempt caps expressed above mainly represent protection that was purchased in conjunction with lender hedging requirements that require the borrower to protect against significant fluctuations in interest rates 
outside of such requirements  we generally do not hedge tax exempt debt because  since  the base rate of this type of financing has averaged and has never exceeded 
we estimate the fair value of our debt instruments by discounting future cash payments at interest rates that approximate the current market 
based on these parameters  the carrying amount of our total fixed rate debt at january  was  compared to an estimated fair value of  we estimate that a basis point decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of this fixed rate debt to approximately  at january  we estimate the fair value of our hedging instruments based on interest rate market pricing models 
at january  and  interest rate caps were reported at fair value of approximately  and  respectively  in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of interest rate swap and floor agreements which had a net positive fair value of  at january  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of interest rate swap and floor agreements which had a net negative fair value of  at january  is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets
